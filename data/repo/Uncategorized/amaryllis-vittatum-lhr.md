## 🌱 Overview
Amaryllis () is the only genus in the subtribe Amaryllidinae (tribe Amaryllideae). It is a small genus of flowering bulbs, with two species. The better known of the two, Amaryllis belladonna, is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley and Knysna.
For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names Amaryllis and Hippeastrum, one result of which is that the common name 'amaryllis' is mainly used for cultivars of the genus Hippeastrum, widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors.
Plants of the genus Amaryllis are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name 'lily' due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, Lilium. In the Victorian language of flowers, amaryllis means "love, beauty, and determination", and can also represent hope and achievement.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide bright, indirect light and consistent moisture during the growing season, mimicking its tropical origins with wet and dry periods. Fertilize regularly when actively growing to support strong foliage and flowering. Ensure a drier, dormant period for successful reblooming.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize monthly with a balanced liquid fertilizer during active growth (spring and summer). Reduce or cease during dormancy.
