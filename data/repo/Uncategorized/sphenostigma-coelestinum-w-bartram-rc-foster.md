## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wetland native thrives in consistently moist to wet, acidic soils under full to partial sun, mimicking its subtropical bog and savanna habitat. Provide ample water, especially during warm months, and avoid overly rich fertilizers to encourage healthy growth and flowering. It is well-suited for bog gardens or areas with naturally poor drainage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or none if soil is already rich.
