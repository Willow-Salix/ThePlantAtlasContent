## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America, including southeastern Canada (Newfoundland west to Ontario) and the eastern United States (south to Tennessee and North Carolina). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Wetland / Moist Temperate Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers bright, indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate full sun if soil moisture is consistently high and temperatures are not extreme. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil, especially during the active growing season. It thrives in boggy or very moist conditions and should never be allowed to dry out completely. High ambient humidity is also beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
The genus Platanthera belongs to the subfamily Orchidoideae of the family Orchidaceae, and comprises about 150 species of orchids. The members of this genus, known as the butterfly orchids or fringed orchids, were previously included in the genus Orchis, which is a close relative (along with the genus Habenaria). They are distributed throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are terrestrial and have tubercules. The genomes of Platanthera zijinensis and Platanthera guangdongensis have been sequenced as model species to study partial and full mycoheterotrophy.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Lesser Purple Fringed Orchid, provide consistently moist to wet, acidic soil in a temperate environment with bright, indirect light to partial sun. Ensure high humidity and apply light, diluted fertilizer only during its active growth phase to mimic its native wetland habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the active growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced, diluted orchid fertilizer. As these orchids naturally grow in nutrient-poor, often acidic soils, over-fertilization can be detrimental.
