## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across tropical America, including southern Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and tropical South America (e.g., Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Wet Montane Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light or partial shade, mimicking its native habitat under a forest canopy. Avoid direct harsh sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires frequent watering to keep the substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during active growth. High humidity is crucial, so daily misting or a humidity tray is beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Epidendrum , abbreviated Epi in the horticultural trade, is a large neotropical genus of the orchid family. With more than 1,500 species,  some authors describe it as a mega-genus. The genus name (from Greek επί, epi and δένδρον, dendron, "upon trees") refers to its epiphytic growth habit.
When Carl Linnaeus named this genus in 1763, he included in this genus all the epiphytic orchids known to him. Although few of these orchids are still included in the genus Epidendrum, some species of Epidendrum are nevertheless not epiphytic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical rainforest home, requiring bright indirect light and consistently moist (but well-drained) conditions. High humidity is essential, along with regular feeding using a diluted orchid fertilizer to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed with a diluted, balanced orchid-specific fertilizer (e.g., half-strength) every 1-2 weeks during the growing season. Reduce frequency in winter.
