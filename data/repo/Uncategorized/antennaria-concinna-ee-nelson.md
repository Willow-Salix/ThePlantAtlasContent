## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Rocky Mountain region of the United States (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, as it thrives in open, exposed high-altitude meadows without significant tree canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, preferring well-drained soil and tolerating drier conditions once established. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Payson's Pussytoes requires full sun and excellent drainage to mimic its native subalpine meadow habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to lean, rocky, and less fertile soils typical of its native subalpine environment.
