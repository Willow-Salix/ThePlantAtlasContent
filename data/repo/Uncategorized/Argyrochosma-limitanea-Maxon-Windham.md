## 🌱 Overview
Argyrochosma is a genus of ferns known commonly as false cloak ferns. The genus is included in the Cheilanthoideae subfamily of the Pteridaceae.  Species now in this genus were previously treated as members of related genera Notholaena or Pellaea but were segregated into their own genus in 1987.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient desert fern thrives on neglect rather than over-care. Provide partial shade with protection from harsh sun and ensure extremely well-draining soil. Water sparingly, allowing the substrate to dry thoroughly between waterings, and fertilize very minimally, if at all.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Native to nutrient-poor, rocky soils; over-fertilizing can be detrimental. A very dilute, balanced feed once in spring is ample.
