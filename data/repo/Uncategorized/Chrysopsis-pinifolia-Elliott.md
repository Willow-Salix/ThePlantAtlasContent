## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Georgia and Florida) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Pine Barrens |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open habitat in pine barrens and sandy fields. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, mirroring its adaptation to dry, sandy native soils. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chrysopsis (golden asters) are plants in the family Asteraceae native to the southern and eastern United States. All the species are found in Florida, although some are found in other states as well.
These are annual and perennial herbs bearing daisy-like flower heads with yellow disc florets and usually yellow ray florets. Some species formerly classified in this genus are now included in other genera: Heterotheca, Pityopsis, Stenotus, Ionactis, Aster, Eucephalus, Erigeron, Machaeranthera, Croptilon, Xanthisma, Oclemena, Bradburia, Oxypappus, Arnica, and Helichrysopsis.
Golden asters are often used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Schinia petulans (which feeds exclusively on C. subulata).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pineleaf Goldenaster thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, emulating its native subtropical pine barren habitat. It is a very low-maintenance plant, requiring infrequent watering once established and performing best with minimal or no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. This plant is adapted to poor, sandy soils and can be sensitive to overly rich nutrients.
