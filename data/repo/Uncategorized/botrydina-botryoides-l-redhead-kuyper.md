## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, extending into high-altitude tropical montane areas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Forests, Boreal Forests, and Tropical Montane Cloud Forests, characterized by high humidity and consistent moisture. |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low to indirect light; thrives in deep shade or filtered sunlight, often beneath dense canopies or among mosses. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires very high, consistent atmospheric humidity and regular moisture from mist or rainfall, but must not be waterlogged. Simulates frequent dew or light rain. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lichenomphalia is both a basidiolichen and an agaric genus. Most of the species have inconspicuous lichenized thalli that consist of scattered, small, loose, nearly microscopic green balls or foliose small flakes containing single-celled green algae in the genus Coccomyxa, all interconnected by a loose network of hyphae. The agaric fruit bodies themselves are nonlichenized and resemble other types of omphalinoid mushrooms. These agarics lack clamp connections and do not form hymenial cystidia. The basidiospores are hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, and nonamyloid. Most of the species were originally classified in the genera Omphalina or Gerronema. Historically the species were classified with those other genera in the family, the Tricholomataceae together with the nonlichenized species. Lichenomphalia species can be grouped into brightly colored taxa, with vivid yellow and orange colors, versus the grey brown group, depending upon the microscopic pigmentation deposits. Molecular research comparing DNA sequences now place Lichenomphalia close to the redefined genus Arrhenia, which together with several other genera not traditionally considered to be related, fall within the newly redefined Hygrophoraceae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in consistently cool, very humid, and shaded environments. Provide regular atmospheric moisture and avoid any direct sun or high nutrient fertilizers to mimic its natural, damp forest floor or montane cloud forest habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No conventional fertilization required. It obtains nutrients from the air, rain, and substrate. High nutrient levels can be detrimental.
