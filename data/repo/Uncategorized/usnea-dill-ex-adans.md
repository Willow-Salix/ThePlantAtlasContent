## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Globally distributed, common in temperate, boreal, and montane regions across continents including North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forests, Boreal Forests, Montane Cloud Forests. Characterized by high humidity, frequent rainfall, fog, or mist, and moderate temperatures. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Prefers filtered light found within forest canopies and is sensitive to intense, direct sunlight which can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high ambient humidity and frequent moisture from rain, fog, or mist, absorbed directly from the air. Should not be submerged or left in standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Usnea is a genus of fruticose lichens in the large family Parmeliaceae. The genus, which currently contains roughly 130 species, was established by Michel Adanson in 1763. Species in the genus grow like leafless mini-shrubs or tassels anchored on bark or twigs. Members of the genus are commonly called old man's beard, beard lichen, or beard moss. Usnea lichens are characterized by their shrubby growth form, elastic branches with a central cord, and distinctive soralia that produce vegetative propagules. They vary in colour from pale green to yellow-green, grey-green, reddish, or variegated, and range in size from a few millimetres in polluted areas to over three metres long in species like Usnea longissima.
Members of the genus are similar to those of the genus Alectoria. A distinguishing test is that the branches of Usnea are somewhat elastic, but the branches of Alectoria snap cleanly off. Usnea species are widely distributed across temperate and tropical regions worldwide, growing primarily on trees but occasionally on rocks, and are sensitive bioindicators of air quality, thriving only in unpolluted environments. The genus has a complex taxonomic history, with many species historically over-described due to environmental variations, though modern approaches using chemical, morphological, and molecular analyses have helped clarify relationships. Usnea lichens have been used traditionally for medicinal purposes, textile dyes, fire starters, and occasionally as emergency food, and serve important ecological roles including providing nesting material for birds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Beard lichen thrives in high humidity and clean air, requiring bright, indirect light or partial shade. It absorbs moisture directly from the environment and does not need traditional watering or fertilization, making it sensitive to pollutants and excess nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens obtain nutrients primarily from the air and photosynthesis. They are highly sensitive to pollutants and excess nutrient levels, which can be detrimental.
