## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Eastern Texas, extending into Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, within the broader Great Plains region of North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Riparian |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily). As a large, canopy-level tree, it requires unimpeded exposure to sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, especially when young, mimicking its native habitat along rivers and floodplains. Mature trees tolerate some drought but thrive with regular watering during dry periods and can withstand periodic flooding. |

## 🌱 Overview
Populus is a genus of 25–30 species of deciduous flowering plants in the family Salicaceae, native to most of the Northern Hemisphere. English names variously applied to different species include poplar (), aspen, and cottonwood.
The western balsam poplar (P. trichocarpa) was the first tree to have its full DNA code determined by DNA sequencing, in 2006.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Texas Plains Cottonwood is a large, fast-growing riparian tree native to the Great Plains, particularly Texas and surrounding states. It demands full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil, tolerating temporary flooding. Minimal fertilization is needed, but ensure regular watering, especially when young, for optimal health and rapid growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not necessary in rich, alluvial soils. A balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil is poor or growth appears stunted.
