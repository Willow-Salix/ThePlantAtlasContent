## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, and New Guinea. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Monsoon and Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth, especially as it matures and aims for canopy dominance. Young plants may tolerate light partial shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent and ample moisture, mimicking tropical rainfall patterns, particularly during warm growing periods. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging, but do not allow it to dry out completely for extended periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Albizia is a genus of more than 160 species of mostly fast-growing subtropical and tropical trees and shrubs in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the family Fabaceae. The genus is pantropical, occurring in Asia, Africa, Madagascar, America and Australia, but mostly in the Old World tropics. In some locations, some species are considered weeds.
They are commonly called silk plants, silk trees, or sirises. The obsolete spelling of the generic name – with double 'z' – is still common, so the plants may be called albizzias. The generic name honors the Italian nobleman Filippo degli Albizzi, who introduced Albizia julibrissin to Europe in the mid-18th century. Some species are commonly called mimosa, which more accurately refers to plants of genus Mimosa. Species from southeast Asia used for timber are sometime termed East Indian walnut.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical tree thrives in full sun and high humidity, requiring consistent watering and well-draining soil to replicate its native monsoon or rainforest environment. Provide a balanced fertilizer during its growth periods, considering its natural nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen fertilization may not be necessary.
