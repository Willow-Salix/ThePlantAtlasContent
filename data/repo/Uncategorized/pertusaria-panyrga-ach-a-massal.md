## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | As a lichen, it absorbs moisture from the air and rain/dew. It requires consistently high ambient humidity or regular exposure to mist/rain, rather than traditional watering. It can tolerate dry periods but needs rehydration to thrive. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pertusaria is a large genus of warty crustose lichens in the Pertusariaceae family. The fruiting bodies are usually modified apothecia that immersed in warts on the main body (thallus) with small holes for the spores to emerge, similar to ostioles, or are fully above and lecanorine (spore bearing discs surrounded by a ring of tissue similar to the tissue of the thallus.  Members of the genus are commonly called wart lichens.
The widespread genus contains over 500 species.
Classification in the large genus relies heavily on thallus chemistry to distinguish and classify species, some of which differ only in the presence or absence of a single secondary chemical. Lichexanthone, norlichexanthone, and their chlorinated derivatives are common in this genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in environments with consistent high humidity and bright indirect light, typically on tree bark or rocks. It absorbs all necessary moisture and nutrients from the atmosphere, making traditional watering and fertilizing unnecessary and potentially harmful. Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues during humid periods.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required or recommended. Lichens absorb trace nutrients from the air and rainwater; fertilizers can be harmful.
