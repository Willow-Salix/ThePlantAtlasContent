## 🧤 Care Instructions
Adapted to Mediterranean climates, this plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and has minimal fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Prefers lean to moderately fertile soils. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and does not require heavy fertilization; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is typically sufficient if desired.
