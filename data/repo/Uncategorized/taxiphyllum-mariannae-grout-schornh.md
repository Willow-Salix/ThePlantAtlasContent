## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical aquatic moss thrives in stable freshwater environments with low to moderate light and consistent submersion. It requires moderate nutrients from the water column and benefits from stable water parameters, making it suitable for aquariums with appropriate lighting and water quality management.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. Benefits from liquid fertilization in the water column, receiving nutrients from dissolved minerals and organic matter. Over-fertilization should be avoided to prevent algae growth.
