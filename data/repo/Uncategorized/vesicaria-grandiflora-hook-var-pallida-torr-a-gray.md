## 📋 Quick Specs

| :--- | :--- |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soil, characteristic of its native arid grasslands and desert. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering where the soil dries completely between sessions. Fertilization should be minimal, if any, to avoid over-enrichment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Thrives in lean soils; a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer once in spring if needed, but often not necessary.
