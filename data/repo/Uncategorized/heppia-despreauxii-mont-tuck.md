## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, including North Africa (e.g., Algeria, Morocco) and Southern Europe (e.g., Spain), extending to arid regions of North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Mediterranean Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to bright indirect light; this lichen thrives in exposed, high-light environments, often on rocks. |
| **💧 Water** | Very infrequent; adapted to long dry periods and absorbing moisture from occasional rain, dew, or humidity in its arid native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Heppia is a genus of olive, brownish, grey, or blackish squamulose, crustose, or peltate like lichens. Heppia was once the type genus of the family Heppiaceae, but that family was folded into synonymy with Lichinaceae.
In a multilocus phylogeny and re-classification of the class Lichinomycetes published in 2024, María Prieto, Mats Wedin and Matthias Schultz placed Heppia in the family Porocyphaceae as part of an emended, broader circumscription of that family; earlier treatments that folded Heppiaceae into Lichinaceae are therefore superseded by the new arrangement. Species of Heppia are cyanolichens (usually with filamentous cyanobacteria) that favour open, well-lit habitats on soil or rock, including biological soil crusts in dry regions; they characteristically produce small squamules or peltate to crustose thalli and develop predominantly pycnoascocarpous sexual structures, consistent with the family diagnosis.
The genus was circumscribed by Carl Wilhelm von Nägeli and Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo in 1854. The genus name Heppiella honours Johann Adam Philipp Hepp (1797–1867), a German physician and lichenologist.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in bright, arid conditions, requiring high light exposure. It needs very little water, relying on infrequent rehydration from atmospheric moisture or occasional rainfall. Fertilization is generally not necessary as it absorbs nutrients directly from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; lichens obtain essential nutrients primarily from the air, dust, and the substrate they grow on, rather than from nutrient-rich soil.
