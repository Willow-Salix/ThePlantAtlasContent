## 🌱 Overview
Salix × sepulcralis 'Chrysocoma', or Weeping Golden Willow[1], is the most popular and widely grown weeping tree in the warm temperate regions of the world. It is an artificial hybrid between  S. alba 'Vitellina' and  S. babylonica. The first parent provides the frost hardiness and the golden shoots and the second parent the strong weeping habit.
This cross was originally made at the Späth Nursery (Berlin, Germany) and was first mentioned in their 1888 nursery catalogue as S. vitellina pendula nova. 
Being a cultivar from the Chrysocoma Group, which includes all crosses between S. alba and S. babylonica, it is much hardier and more long-lived than the Babylon Willow (Salix babylonica). This particular cultivar is easily distinguished from the other Golden Weeping Willow (S. × sepulcralis) by its androgynous catkins.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Golden Weeping Willow is a fast-growing tree that demands full sun and constant moisture, replicating its natural wetland preferences. It is relatively unfussy about soil type, provided it remains consistently wet, and benefits from moderate fertilization to encourage robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in early spring, particularly to support its vigorous growth in less fertile soils.
