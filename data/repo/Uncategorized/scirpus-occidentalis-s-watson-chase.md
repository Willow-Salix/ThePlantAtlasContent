Schoenoplectus acutus (syn. Scirpus acutus, Schoenoplectus lacustris, Scirpus lacustris  subsp. acutus),  called tule , common tule, hardstem tule, tule rush, hardstem bulrush, or viscid bulrush, is a giant species of sedge in the plant family Cyperaceae, native to freshwater marshes all over North America. The common name derives from the Nāhuatl word tōllin [ˈtoːlːin], and it was first recognized by the early Spanish explorers and missionaries in New Spain who saw the marsh plants in the Central Valley of California as similar to those in the marshes around Mexico City being used to construct shelters by the indigenous inhabitants.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This aquatic plant thrives in full sun and requires a consistently wet to submerged environment, mimicking its native marsh and wetland habitats. Ensure its roots are always in water or heavily saturated soil. While not a heavy feeder, a light application of aquatic fertilizer during the growing season can support vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from a slow-release aquatic fertilizer during the growing season, but can tolerate nutrient-poor conditions.
