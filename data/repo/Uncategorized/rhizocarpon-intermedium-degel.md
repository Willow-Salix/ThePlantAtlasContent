## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America (e.g., California, Washington, Alaska) and Europe (e.g., Scandinavia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal, specifically found on open, exposed siliceous rock habitats |
| **☀️ Light** | High light to full sun exposure, as it naturally grows on unshaded, exposed rocks. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires periods of wetting (from rainfall or high humidity) followed by drying; highly tolerant of drought when dry, absorbing moisture directly from the atmosphere. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rhizocarpon is a genus of crustose, saxicolous (or sometimes lichenicolous), lecideoid lichens in the family Rhizocarpaceae. The genus is common in arctic-alpine environments, but also occurs throughout temperate, subtropical, and even tropical regions. They are commonly known as map lichens because of the prothallus forming border-like bands between colonies in some species, like the common map lichen (Rhizocarpon geographicum).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This crustose lichen thrives in high light on exposed siliceous rocks, needing natural cycles of wetting and drying. It does not require traditional soil or fertilizer, obtaining nutrients and water directly from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer requirements; obtains necessary nutrients from airborne particles and its rock substrate.
