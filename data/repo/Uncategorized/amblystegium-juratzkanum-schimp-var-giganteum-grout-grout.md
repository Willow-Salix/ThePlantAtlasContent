## 🧤 Care Instructions
This aquatic/semi-aquatic moss thrives in consistently wet to submerged conditions with high humidity. It prefers low to moderate indirect light and should never be allowed to dry out. Fertilization needs are minimal, focusing on clean water with natural trace elements.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; mosses are low-nutrient plants. Provide clean water with trace minerals rather than heavy fertilization.
