## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Culbertson's Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native subalpine montane habitat. Water moderately during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization, especially nitrogen. Once established, it is quite drought-tolerant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; as a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. Rich soils or excessive nitrogen can hinder flowering. Lean, well-drained soil is preferred.
