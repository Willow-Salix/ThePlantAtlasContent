## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient shrub thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires very well-draining, even rocky, acidic soil. It is adapted to wet winters and dry summers, needing regular water during cooler growing seasons but tolerating drought in summer. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer, as it is adapted to naturally poor, rocky (often serpentine) soils. If necessary, a very dilute, acid-loving plant formula can be applied sparingly in spring.
