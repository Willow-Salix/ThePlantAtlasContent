## 🌱 Overview
Cerastium is a genus of annual, winter annual, or perennial flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. They are commonly called mouse-ears or mouse-ear chickweeds. There are 214 accepted species, found nearly worldwide but with the greatest concentration in the northern temperate regions. A number of the species are common weeds in fields and on disturbed ground.

Cerastium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora chalcogrammella (which feeds exclusively on Cerastium arvense) and Coleophora striatipennella (which has been recorded on Cerastium fontanum).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Field Chickweed is a resilient plant native to temperate regions of North America, flourishing in open, sunny to partially shaded locations. It prefers well-drained soil that is allowed to dry out between waterings and requires minimal fertilization, thriving even in average or poorer soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate, as it can thrive in poor to average soils. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied annually is sufficient if desired.
