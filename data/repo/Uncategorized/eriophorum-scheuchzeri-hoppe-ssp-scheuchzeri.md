## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arctic-alpine plant thrives in perpetually wet, acidic conditions under full sun. Mimic its native boggy environment by ensuring constant moisture, even standing water, and avoid high temperatures and rich fertilizers for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Native soils are typically nutrient-poor and acidic; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
