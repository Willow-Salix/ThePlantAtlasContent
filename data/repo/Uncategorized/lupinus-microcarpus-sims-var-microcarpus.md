## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (primarily California, Oregon, and Baja California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Chaparral, Oak Woodland, Grassland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it typically grows in open, exposed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate water during its active growing period (spring), allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. It is adapted to the dry summers of its native climate, tolerating drought once established, but as an annual, it completes its life cycle before intense summer heat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus bicolor is a species of lupine known as the miniature lupine, Lindley's annual lupine, pigmy-leaved lupine, or bicolor lupine.
It is a showy flowering annual or perennial plant native to western North America, from northwestern Baja California, throughout California, and north to British Columbia. It is found in diverse habitats below 3,000 feet (910 m), including: grasslands; chaparral; oak, mixed conifer and Joshua tree woodlands; coastal sage scrub; and open conifer forests. It often shares habitats with other prolifically blooming spring and early summer wildflowers, including the California poppy.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Miniature Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring the distinct wet winters and dry summers of a Mediterranean climate. Provide moderate water during its spring growth, but reduce as it matures, and avoid excessive fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and can thrive in poor to moderately fertile soils. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers, which can inhibit flowering.
