## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South Africa (primarily Western Cape region) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth and flowering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, but regular watering improves bloom performance. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arctotis is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the family Asteraceae.
Arctotis is native to dry stony slopes in southern Africa. Some of the plants are alternatively placed in the genus Venidium. The common name is "African daisy", or "Gousblom" in Afrikaans. These plants have daisy-like composite flowers which tend to close in the late afternoon or in dull weather, but numerous cultivars have been developed for garden use which stay open for longer, and are available in a wide range of colours. Tender perennials are often grown in temperate regions as half-hardy annuals.
The garden hybrid A. × hybrida hort. 'Flame' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.  
Vigorous Arctotis hybrids like 'Pink Sugar' and 'Large Marge' are popular choices for garden design for the diverse colors of their blooms.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Venidium thrives in conditions mirroring its South African Mediterranean origin, requiring full sun and well-draining soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and fertilize sparingly to encourage abundant blooms. These conditions prevent root rot and ensure vigorous, floriferous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder. Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season, especially in poor soils or containers. Over-fertilization can promote foliage over flowers.
