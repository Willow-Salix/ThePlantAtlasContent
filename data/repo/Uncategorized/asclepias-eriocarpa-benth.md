## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California (USA) and northern Baja California (Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Chaparral and Woodlands biome) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sun daily), as it grows in open fields and dry slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate; drought-tolerant once established, reflecting hot, dry native summers. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Asclepias is a genus of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants known as milkweeds, named for their latex, a milky substance containing cardiac glycosides termed cardenolides, exuded where cells are damaged. Most species are toxic to humans and many other species, primarily due to the presence of cardenolides. However, as with many such plants, some species feed upon milkweed leaves or the nectar from their flowers. A noteworthy feeder on milkweeds is the monarch butterfly, which uses and requires certain milkweeds as host plants for its larvae.
The Asclepias genus contains over 200 species distributed broadly across Africa, North America, and South America. It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Woollypod Milkweed thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean habitat. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering during its growing season. This is a low-maintenance plant that generally does not need heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in nutrient-poor soils found in its native habitat. Fertilization is generally not necessary, or a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring if soil is extremely poor.
