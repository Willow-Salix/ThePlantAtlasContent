Names in homonym genus
In 1851, Duchassaing & Walpers used the same generic name, Sagotia, to refer to a very different plant. Ordinarily, the rules of nomenclature mandate that the older name should be considered legitimate, while the newer one would need to be abandoned. In this case, however, the decision was made to conserve the newer name and reject the older one. Thus the one name in the older name was changed as follows:

Sagotia triflora (L.) Duchass. & Walp. - Desmodium triflorum (L.) DC.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sagotia triflora thrives in warm, highly humid environments with consistent moisture and bright, indirect light, mimicking its tropical rainforest origin. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging, and provide moderate fertilization during active growth for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding during the growing season (spring through summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, reflecting the quick nutrient cycling in rainforest ecosystems.
