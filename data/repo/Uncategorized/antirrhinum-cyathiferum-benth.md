## 🌱 Overview
Antirrhinum is a genus of plants in the Plantaginaceae family, commonly known as dragon flowers or snapdragons because of the flowers' fancied resemblance to the face of a dragon that opens and closes its mouth when laterally squeezed. They are also sometimes called toadflax or dog flower. They are native to rocky areas of Europe, the United States, Canada, and North Africa. Antirrhinum species are widely used as ornamental plants in borders and as cut flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring infrequent, deep watering once the soil has completely dried out. Fertilize sparingly during its active growth period, embracing its adaptation to arid, lean environments for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization with a balanced, diluted fertilizer during the growing season; thrives in lean, well-draining soils typical of its native environment.
