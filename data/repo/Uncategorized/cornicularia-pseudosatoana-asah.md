## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Alpine and subalpine regions of Japan |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine/Subalpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | High exposure to bright, direct sunlight, typical of high-altitude environments above the treeline. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires frequent access to atmospheric moisture (e.g., fog, dew, rain) to rehydrate, with tolerance for dry periods between hydration cycles. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cornicularia is a genus of lichenised ascomycetes in the large family Parmeliaceae. It is a monotypic genus, with a single currently accepted species, the saxicolous lichen Cornicularia normoerica, and is sometimes referred to as the bootstrap lichen. The lichen forms small, dark tufts rarely exceeding 2 cm in height that are anchored so firmly to rocks, with narrow, stiff branches topped by shiny black reproductive discs. It grows on high-elevation, sun-exposed rocks and boulders, where its compact, shrub-like appearance and glossy black-brown surface make it distinctive among mountain lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions with good air circulation. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture for rehydration, either through frequent misting or high ambient humidity, and does not need any fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is needed; lichens derive nutrients from the air and precipitation and are sensitive to high nutrient concentrations.
