## 🌱 Overview
Dalea  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as prairie clover or indigo bush. Its name honors English apothecary Samuel Dale (1659–1739). They are native to the Western hemisphere, where they are distributed from Canada to Argentina. Nearly half of the known species are endemic to Mexico. Two species of Dalea (Dalea ornata and Dalea searlsiae) have been considered for rangeland restoration.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dalea oaxacana thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native tropical dry forest and montane scrub habitats in Mexico. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and has low fertilizer needs. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring or a light liquid feed can suffice, particularly in poor soils. Avoid excessive nitrogen, as legumes fix their own nitrogen.
