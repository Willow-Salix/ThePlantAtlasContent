## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and Central Canada (from Newfoundland west to Manitoba) and the northeastern United States (from New England west to Minnesota and south in the Appalachian Mountains). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forest/Wetland, characterized by cool to cold winters and mild to warm summers with consistent precipitation. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day is ideal for optimal growth and fruit production), thriving in open areas or forest edges. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native bog and moist woodland habitats. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely, especially during fruiting. |

## 🌱 Overview
Vaccinium  vack-SIN-ee-əm is a common and widespread genus of shrubs or dwarf shrubs in the heath family (Ericaceae). The fruits of many species are eaten by humans and some are of commercial importance, including the cranberry, blueberry, bilberry (whortleberry), lingonberry (cowberry), and huckleberry. Like many other heath plants, they are restricted to acidic soils.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Canada Blueberry, provide a location with full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil remains consistently moist and well-drained. Maintain acidic soil conditions through amendments or an acid-specific fertilizer, as it naturally thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers acidic, often nutrient-poor soils. Light fertilization with an acid-loving plant formula is recommended, or incorporating organic matter to maintain soil acidity. Avoid high nitrogen fertilizers.
