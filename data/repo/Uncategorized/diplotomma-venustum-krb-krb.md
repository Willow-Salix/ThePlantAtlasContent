| **💧 Water** | Infrequent direct wetting from rain, dew, or mist; requires high atmospheric humidity and distinct dry periods between wetting. Does not require soil watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Diplotomma is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Caliciaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains 14 species. These lichens form firmly attached, crust-like patches that range from pale to dark grey and can appear smooth or cracked into an irregular mosaic pattern on their substrate. They produce black, disc-shaped fruiting bodies that start buried in the crust and later emerge to sit roughly flush with the surface, often dusted with a greyish-white powder.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This saxicolous lichen thrives in cool temperate to arctic-alpine conditions, preferring full to partial sun exposure on stable rock substrates. It requires high atmospheric humidity or periodic wetting, allowing for distinct dry spells, and should never be fertilized as it naturally obtains nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None; traditional fertilizers are harmful to lichens. It obtains all necessary nutrients from the air and its substrate.
