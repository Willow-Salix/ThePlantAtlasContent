| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Mojave Desert, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Desert and Semi-Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, deep watering. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in winter. Highly drought-tolerant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Opuntia phaeacantha is a species of prickly pear cactus known by the common names brown-spine prickly pear, tulip prickly pear, and desert prickly pear, which is found across the southwestern United States, lower Great Plains, and northern Mexico. The plant forms dense but localized thickets. Several varieties of this particular species occur, and it may hybridize with other prickly pears, making identification sometimes tricky.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a desert native, the Mojave Prickly Pear thrives in conditions mimicking its arid home. Provide abundant sunlight and very infrequent watering, allowing its soil to dry out completely to prevent root rot. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor desert soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. If desired, a balanced, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer can be applied once a year during the active growing season (spring/early summer) at half strength.
