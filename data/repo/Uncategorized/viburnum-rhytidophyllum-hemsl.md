## 🌱 Overview
Viburnum is a genus of about 150–175 species of flowering plants in the moschatel family, Adoxaceae or its alternative name Viburnaceae. Its current classification is based on molecular phylogeny. It was previously included in the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae.
The member species are evergreen or deciduous shrubs or (in a few cases) small trees native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species extending into tropical montane regions in South America and southeast Asia. In Africa, the genus is confined to the Atlas Mountains.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This robust shrub thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring consistently moist but well-drained soil. Mimicking its temperate montane origin, it benefits from moderate fertility and an annual spring feeding. Once established, it is relatively low-maintenance and tolerant of varying conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Average fertility; benefits from an annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring to support vigorous growth.
