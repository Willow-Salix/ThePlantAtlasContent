## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Oaxaca, Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade, mimicking its natural habitat as an epiphyte under a tree canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during the growing season (spring/summer), allowing the topsoil to dry out between waterings. Significantly reduce watering in fall and winter, allowing it to dry out almost completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Selenicereus, from Ancient Greek σελήνη (selḗnē), meaning "moon", and Latin cēreus, meaning "candle", sometimes known as moonlight cactus, is a genus of epiphytic, lithophytic, and terrestrial cacti, found in Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America. The term night-blooming cereus is also sometimes used, but this is also used for many night-blooming cacti, including Epiphyllum and Peniocereus. In 2017, the genus Hylocereus was brought into synonymy with Selenicereus. A number of species of Selenicereus produce fruit that is eaten. The fruit, known as pitaya or pitahaya in Spanish or as dragon fruit, may be collected from the wild or the plants may be cultivated.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic cactus thrives in bright indirect light, mimicking its tropical forest home. It requires consistent watering during its growing season with a dry period in winter, and benefits from light, regular fertilization. Provide a well-draining, airy substrate to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring to early fall). No fertilizer during winter dormancy.
