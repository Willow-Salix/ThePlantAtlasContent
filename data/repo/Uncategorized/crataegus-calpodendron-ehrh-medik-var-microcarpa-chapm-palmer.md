## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate North American hawthorn thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil. Once established, it exhibits some drought tolerance and generally requires low to moderate fertilization to support its robust growth and fruit production.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring, especially in poor soils, but it is often not strictly necessary in rich soil.
