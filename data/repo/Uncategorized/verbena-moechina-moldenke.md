## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South America (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay), likely a garden hybrid of South American species. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Temperate Grasslands and Pampas |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) reflecting its open grassland habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerant of some drought once established, mimicking periods of less rainfall in its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid vervain thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, similar to its South American grassland relatives. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between waterings, and fertilize sparingly to avoid overly leggy growth. Its hardy nature makes it relatively low-maintenance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring or a diluted liquid feed monthly during the growing season is sufficient, as grassland soils are not typically extremely rich.
