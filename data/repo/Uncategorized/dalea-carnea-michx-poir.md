## 🧤 Care Instructions
Whitetassels thrive in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils typical of its native southeastern US habitat. Provide regular watering during dry spells, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between applications, and fertilize lightly with a balanced, low-nitrogen formula to encourage abundant flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula or a low-nitrogen fertilizer once a year in spring. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen should be avoided as it can inhibit flowering.
