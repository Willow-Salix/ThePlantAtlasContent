## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide a warm, humid environment with abundant sunlight to mimic its tropical origins. Ensure consistent moisture during active growth, allowing slight drying between waterings. Fertilize moderately during the growing season to support its vigorous development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer. Being a legume, they fix nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen may not be necessary.
