## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Regions from Iran to northern India, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, with early naturalization across the Mediterranean basin. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid and Semi-Arid Scrubland, often with a Mediterranean-like climate in parts of its extended range. |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun exposure, ideally 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, to thrive and produce fruit. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce watering in cooler months. |

## 🌱 Overview
The pomegranate (Punica granatum) is a fruit-bearing, deciduous shrub in the family Lythraceae, subfamily Punicoideae, that grows between 5 and 10 m (16 and 33 ft) tall. Rich in symbolic and mythological associations in many cultures, it is thought to have originated from Iran before being introduced and exported to other parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe, though also considered to be native to Indian Subcontinent (particularly Northern India) and Afghanistan.
It was introduced into Spanish America in the late 16th century and into California by Spanish settlers in 1769. It is widely cultivated throughout West Asia and the Caucasus region, South Asia, Central Asia, north and tropical Africa, the drier parts of Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean Basin. The fruit is typically in season in the Northern Hemisphere from September to February, and in the Southern Hemisphere from March to May.
The pomegranate and its juice are variously used in baking, cooking, juice blends, garnishes, nonalcoholic drinks, and cocktails.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pomegranates thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring their arid native habitat. While they tolerate drought, consistent deep watering during the growing season is crucial for fruit development. Fertilize moderately to support healthy growth and production.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeder; benefits from a balanced fertilizer application in early spring and mid-summer, especially for young plants or those in poor soil.
