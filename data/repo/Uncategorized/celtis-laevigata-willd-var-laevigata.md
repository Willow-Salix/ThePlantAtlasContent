## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (from Virginia south to Florida, west to Texas and Oklahoma, and north to parts of the Midwest) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical to Warm Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth, but can tolerate partial shade, especially when young. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular watering to establish, thriving in moist soils typical of floodplains and riparian areas. Moderately drought-tolerant once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Celtis laevigata is a medium-sized tree native to North America.  Common names include sugarberry, southern hackberry, or in the southern U.S. sugar hackberry or just hackberry.
Sugarberry is easily confused with common hackberry (C. occidentalis) where the range overlaps.  Sugarberry has narrower leaves with mostly smooth margins, the berries are juicier and sweeter, while the bark is less corky. The species can also be distinguished by habitat: where the ranges overlap, common hackberry occurs primarily in upland areas, whereas sugarberry occurs mainly in bottomland areas.
Sugarberry's range extends from the Southeastern United States west to Texas and south to northeastern Mexico. It is also found on the island of Bermuda.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sugarberry is best grown in full sun with consistent moisture, especially during its establishment phase. It adapts well to various soil types but thrives in rich, moist environments typical of its native floodplains. Established trees are generally low-maintenance, requiring minimal supplemental fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization needed in rich, well-draining soils. May benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer for young trees or in poor soil conditions.
