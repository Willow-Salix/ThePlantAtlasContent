## 🌱 Overview
Prunus is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs from the family Rosaceae. The genus includes plums, cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots and almonds (collectively stonefruit). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, being native to the temperate regions of North America, the neotropics of South America, and temperate and tropical regions of Eurasia and Africa, There are about 340 accepted species as of March 2024.
Many members of the genus are widely cultivated for their sweet, fleshy fruit and for decorative purposes of their flowers. Prunus fruit are drupes, or stone fruits. The fleshy mesocarp surrounding the endocarp is edible while the endocarp itself forms a hard, inedible shell called the pyrena ("stone" or "pit"). This shell encloses the seed (or "kernel"), which is edible in some species (such as sweet almonds), but poisonous in many others (such as apricot kernels). Besides being eaten off the hand, most Prunus fruit  are also commonly used in processing, such as jam production, canning, drying, and the seeds for roasting.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Mexican Black Cherry thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its native tropical montane forest environment. Ensure good drainage and provide adequate water during active growth, while it can tolerate some drought once established, and it benefits from moderate soil fertility.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from fertile, organic-rich soil but is not a heavy feeder. Amend soil with compost annually or use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring if soil is poor.
