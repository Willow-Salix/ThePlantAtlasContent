## 🌱 Overview
Oxalis ( (British English) or  (American English)) is a large genus of flowering plants in the wood-sorrel family, Oxalidaceae, comprising over 550 species. The genus occurs throughout most of the world, except for the polar areas; species diversity is particularly rich in tropical Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.
Many of the species are known as wood-sorrels (also as wood sorrels or woodsorrels) as they have an acidic taste reminiscent of the sorrel proper (Rumex acetosa), which is not closely related. Some species are called yellow sorrels or pink sorrels after the colour of their flowers instead. Other species are colloquially known as false shamrocks, and some called sourgrasses. For the genus as a whole, the term oxalises is also used.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This woodland plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native humid subtropical forest habitat. Provide consistent moisture and protect it from intense, direct sunlight, especially during the hottest parts of the day. A light feeding schedule supports healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
