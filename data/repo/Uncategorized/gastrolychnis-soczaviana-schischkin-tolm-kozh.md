## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in bright, open conditions with excellent drainage, mimicking its native rocky, well-drained slopes. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and prefers lean soils, making fertilizer largely unnecessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. Excessive fertilization can lead to weak, leggy growth rather than robust flowering.
