# Colusa Cryptantha
### *Cryptantha nemaclada Greene*

![Colusa Cryptantha](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Cryptanthamuricata.jpg)

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (Central Valley, inner South Coast Ranges, southern Sierra Nevada foothills) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (Arid Scrubland/Grassland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflective of its open grassland habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during hot, dry periods mimicking its native summer dormancy. More frequent watering may be needed during its active growth phase in cooler, wetter seasons. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Colusa Cryptantha is a California native that thrives in full sun and well-draining, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its Mediterranean arid scrubland home. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent deep watering once established, with minimal to no fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in poor, often serpentine or volcanic soils. Fertilizer is generally not needed; if applied, use a very dilute, balanced formula sparingly, only during active growth, to avoid over-fertilization.
