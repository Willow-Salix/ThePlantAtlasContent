## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hartweg's Sundrops is a sun-loving, drought-tolerant perennial that thrives in arid to semi-arid conditions. It requires full sun and well-draining soil, preferring infrequent deep watering and minimal fertilizer to flourish and produce its characteristic yellow blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant thrives in lean to average soils and typically does not require heavy fertilization; a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if soil nutrients are poor.
