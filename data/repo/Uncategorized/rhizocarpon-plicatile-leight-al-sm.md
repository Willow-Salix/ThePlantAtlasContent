## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western Europe, including British Isles, Portugal, and Macaronesia (Azores, Canary Islands) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Oceanic Climate (often on exposed rocks in coastal or montane areas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Thrives in full sun to very bright indirect light, mimicking its natural exposure on open rock surfaces. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular exposure to moisture (rain, dew, high humidity) for hydration, but tolerates periods of desiccation. Does not require root-based watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rhizocarpon is a genus of crustose, saxicolous (or sometimes lichenicolous), lecideoid lichens in the family Rhizocarpaceae. The genus is common in arctic-alpine environments, but also occurs throughout temperate, subtropical, and even tropical regions. They are commonly known as map lichens because of the prothallus forming border-like bands between colonies in some species, like the common map lichen (Rhizocarpon geographicum).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rhizocarpon plicatile, a lichen, thrives in bright, unpolluted environments, typically on exposed rock surfaces. It requires regular periods of moisture for hydration, tolerating desiccation, and is intolerant of added nutrients or air pollution.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; lichens are highly sensitive to introduced nutrients and pollutants.
