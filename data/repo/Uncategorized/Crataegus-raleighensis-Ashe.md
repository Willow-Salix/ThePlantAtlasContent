## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States, particularly North Carolina |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forest (Humid Subtropical Climate) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours direct sunlight daily), reflecting its preference for open woodlands and forest edges. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate; prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil. Its native humid climate suggests regular moisture, but good drainage prevents waterlogging. Tolerates some drought once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Raleigh Hawthorn thrives in full to partial sun, typical of its native open woodland environment in the southeastern U.S. It requires moderate, consistent watering in well-drained soil, especially when young, and benefits from light annual fertilization. This hardy plant is relatively low-maintenance once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; native forest soils provide natural nutrients from decomposing organic matter. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost annually in spring is generally sufficient.
