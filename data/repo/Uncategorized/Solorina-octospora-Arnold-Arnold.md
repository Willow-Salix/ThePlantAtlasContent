## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Alpine regions, including Greenland, Scandinavia, the Alps, and Rocky Mountains. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | High light exposure is tolerated, but it critically requires very cool ambient temperatures, often accompanied by periods of snow cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture, often from snowmelt or frequent precipitation. High ambient humidity or regular misting/wetting of the substrate is beneficial; avoid prolonged dryness. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Chocolate Chip Lichen, replicate its native arctic-alpine habitat by providing bright, cool conditions, ideally with temperatures below typical indoor ranges. Ensure consistent moisture through high humidity or regular wetting of its base-rich substrate, avoiding dry periods.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not typically required. This lichen thrives on base-rich or calcareous substrates and obtains nutrients from the environment and its nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial partner.
