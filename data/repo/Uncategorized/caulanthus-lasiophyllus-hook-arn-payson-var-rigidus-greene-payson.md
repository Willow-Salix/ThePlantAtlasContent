## 🌱 Overview
Caulanthus is a genus of plants in the family Brassicaceae. Plants of this genus may be known as jewelflowers. They are also often referred to as wild cabbage, although this common name usually refers to wild variants of Brassica oleracea, the cabbage plant. Jewelflowers are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they are often found in warm, arid regions. Many species have an enlarged, erect stem rising from a basal rosette of leaves. Flowers arise directly from the surface of the stem; many species have colorful, bell-shaped flowers. The best-known of the fourteen species is probably the desert candle.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil, replicating its native arid scrubland and chaparral environment. Water infrequently, ensuring the soil dries out completely between applications, and avoid over-fertilization as it prefers lean conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically does not require regular fertilization. If soil is very poor, a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once during the growing season.
