## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions of North America, particularly areas with bogs and fens where its parent species (Drosera rotundifolia and Drosera linearis) overlap. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Boreal Bog/Fen |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to encourage robust growth and vibrant color. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently wet conditions; keep the potting medium perpetually moist, often by sitting the pot in a tray of 1-2 inches of distilled, rainwater, or reverse osmosis water. Never allow the soil to dry out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Drosera, which is  commonly known as the sundews, is one of the largest genera of carnivorous plants, with at least 194 species. These members of the family Droseraceae lure, capture, and digest insects using stalked mucilaginous glands covering their leaf surfaces. The insects are used to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which the plants grow. Various species, which vary greatly in size and form, are native to every continent except Antarctica.
Charles Darwin performed much of the early research into Drosera, engaging in a long series of experiments with Drosera rotundifolia, which were the first to confirm carnivory in plants.  In an 1860 letter, Darwin wrote, "...at the present moment, I care more about Drosera than the origin of all the species in the world".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid sundew thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate bog environment. Provide ample direct sunlight, maintain consistently wet roots with mineral-free water, and never fertilize the soil. Its nutrient needs are met naturally through insect capture.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Do not fertilize the soil. As carnivorous plants, Drosera obtain nutrients from trapping insects. Soil fertilizers can be detrimental.
