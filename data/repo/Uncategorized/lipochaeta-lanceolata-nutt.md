## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian native thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil, reflecting its dry, coastal origins. Water infrequently once established, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings, and fertilize lightly during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the growing season; use a balanced, diluted fertilizer sparingly, as native soils are often not exceptionally rich.
