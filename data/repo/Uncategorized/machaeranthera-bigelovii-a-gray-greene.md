## 🌱 Overview
Machaeranthera is a genus of North American flowering plants in the family Asteraceae which are known by the common name tansyaster.
Tansyasters are variable in appearance. Some are small, singular wildflowers, while others are sprawling shrubs. Several species easily hybridize with each other, as well, making identification difficult. In general, members of the genus may be identified by the sharp-pointed, dagger-shaped anthers in the disc florets at the center of the flower. The flower heads are usually daisylike, and are usually a shade of purple or blue, but may be pink, yellow, or white. Tansyasters are native to western North America.
The genus Machaeranthera is distinguished from the genus Dieteria by having once- or twice-pinnate leaves, whereas Dieteria has entire to toothed leaves.
Machaeranthera means "swordlike anthers".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bigelow's Tansyaster is a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant perennial perfectly suited for arid and semi-arid climates. It requires full sun exposure and well-drained, lean soils, with minimal watering once established. Fertilization is typically unnecessary, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor native environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental; a very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in early spring if desired, but is generally not necessary.
