## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its arid native habitat. Provide infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization for best results.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; typically does not require regular fertilization. If grown in very poor soil, a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
