## 🧤 Care Instructions
Threetip sagebrush thrives in conditions mirroring its native arid scrubland: full sun and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and performs best with minimal to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in nutrient-poor, well-draining soils and generally does not require fertilization. If necessary, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be used in spring, but often none is needed.
