| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat on open, exposed slopes and chaparral. |

## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Roezl's Penstemon thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean shrubland environment. It requires infrequent watering, being highly drought-tolerant once established, particularly through dry summer months. Fertilization should be kept minimal to avoid overgrowth and maintain its natural vigor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Native to relatively poor, rocky soils typical of chaparral and open woodlands, so rich soil or excessive fertilizer can be detrimental.
