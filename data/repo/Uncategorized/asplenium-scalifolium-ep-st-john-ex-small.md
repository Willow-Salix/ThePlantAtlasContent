# Bird's Nest Fern
### *Asplenium scalifolium E.P. St. John ex Small*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical Americas (including Florida, West Indies, Mexico, Central and South America) and parts of Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Subtropical Hammocks |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light. As an understory plant, it should be protected from direct sunlight, which can scorch its fronds. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fern thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical rainforest home, requiring bright, indirect light and high humidity. Maintain consistently moist soil, allowing slight drying between waterings, and fertilize sparingly during the growing season for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength once a month during the growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
