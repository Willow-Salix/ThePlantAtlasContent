# False Flax
### *Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz*

![False Flax](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Camelina_sativa_eF.jpg)

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern Europe and Central Asia, extending to the Mediterranean region. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun exposure, at least 6-8 hours daily, to ensure robust growth and optimal seed development, reflecting its open grassland habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers moderate, infrequent watering. Allow the soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings, as it is drought-tolerant and susceptible to root rot in waterlogged conditions, mirroring its adaptation to seasonal rainfall in steppes. |

## 🌱 Overview
Camelina is a genus within the flowering plant family Brassicaceae. The Camelina species, commonly known as false flax, are native to Mediterranean regions of Europe and Asia. Most species of this genus have been little studied, with the exception of Camelina sativa, historically cultivated as an oil plant. Heinrich Johann Nepomuk von Crantz was the first botanist to use the genus Camelina in his classification works in 1762. 
As a way to reduce fossil fuel emissions, the US Navy tested a 50-50 mix of jet aviation fuel and biofuel derived from camelina seeds in 2010. A study published in December 2016 explained that the current low price of conventional kerosene-based jet fuel makes it cost-prohibitive for commercial airlines to use camelina-based jet fuel. The study said substantial government intervention would be one way to create a market for camelina, by combining 9 percent government subsidy on camelina crop production, with 9 percent tax on  conventional fuel.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
False flax is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring moderate and infrequent watering due to its drought tolerance. Minimal fertilization is required, as it is adapted to less fertile conditions characteristic of temperate grasslands.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Has low to moderate fertilizer needs. It can thrive in relatively poor or marginal soils and does not require heavy fertilization, aligning with its growth in naturally less fertile grassland soils.
