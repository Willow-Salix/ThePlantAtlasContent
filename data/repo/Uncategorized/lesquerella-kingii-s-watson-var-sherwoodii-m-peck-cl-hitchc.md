## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (specifically southeastern Oregon and northwestern Nevada, USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cold Desert / Arid Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to mimic its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering is detrimental in its arid native climate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lesquerella is the former name of a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Recent work has shown that Lesquerella is indistinct from the genus Physaria and both genera have been united under Physaria. In addition, the former Lesquerella of the southeastern United States have been moved to the genus Paysonia since 2002. The genus Lesquerella is now no longer applied to any species and is considered defunct.
The genus is named in honor of Leo Lesquereux, 1805–1889, Swiss and American botanist.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soil, requiring minimal water once established. Mimic its arid, rocky native habitat by avoiding overwatering and providing ample sunlight to ensure its health and vigor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; its native rocky and lean soils suggest it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.
