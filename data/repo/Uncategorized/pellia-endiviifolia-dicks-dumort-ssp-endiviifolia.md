## 🌱 Overview
Pellia is a small but widespread genus of liverworts in the cool and temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.  It is classified in order  Pelliales and is a member of the family  Pelliaceae within that order.
Süsswassertang, a plant grown submerged in aquaria was once considered to be Pellia endiviifolia, but is now known to be the indeterminate gametophyte of a Lomariopsis species, a type of fern. Pellia liverworts are also often confused with Monosolenium tenerum, another liverwort.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Endive Pellia thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded environments, mimicking its native temperate forest habitat. Ensure constant humidity and moisture in the substrate, and protect it from any direct sun exposure or drying conditions to prevent desiccation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilization needed, as it naturally grows in nutrient-poor environments on rocks or thin soil layers.
