## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska, Pacific Northwest), Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Central Europe), and Asia (e.g., Japan). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate to Boreal Forests and Peatlands (specifically, moist, often acidic microhabitats on decaying wood, Sphagnum, or humus). |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to Indirect Light. Thrives in shaded conditions, avoiding direct sunlight which can cause desiccation and damage. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity and consistent moisture are crucial. The substrate should be kept constantly damp but not waterlogged. Regular misting or placement in a terrarium is highly beneficial to maintain humidity. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort requires a consistently moist, high-humidity environment, mimicking its native cool temperate to boreal forest and peatland habitats. Provide low to indirect light and avoid direct sun. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, as it's adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to No Fertilizer. Bryophytes are adapted to nutrient-poor environments; high concentrations of fertilizer can be detrimental. If absolutely necessary, use a very diluted, specialized bryophyte or epiphytic plant fertilizer once or twice a year.
