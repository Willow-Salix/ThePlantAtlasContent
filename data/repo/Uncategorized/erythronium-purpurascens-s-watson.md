Erythronium, the fawn lily, trout lily, dog's-tooth violet or adder's tongue, is a genus of Eurasian and North American plants in the lily family, most closely related to tulips. The name Erythronium derives from Ancient Greek ἐρυθρός (eruthrós) "red" in Greek, referring to the red flowers of E. dens-canis. Of all the established species, most live in North America; only six species are found in Europe and Asia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine lily thrives in cool, moist conditions during its spring growth cycle, preferring partial sun to full sun in its native range. It requires consistent moisture in spring, followed by a dry dormancy in summer. Provide well-drained soil and light fertilization for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light application of a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer in early spring as new growth emerges. Avoid heavy fertilization.
