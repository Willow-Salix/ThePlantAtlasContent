## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Gulf Coast states) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect light to partial shade, protected from intense direct sun, mimicking the understory of a humid forest canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | High ambient humidity is crucial, with frequent misting or exposure to moist air. As a lichen, it absorbs moisture from the atmosphere rather than from soil; avoid prolonged dryness. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arthopyrenia is a genus of fungi in the family Trypetheliaceae. It was formerly classified in the eponymic family Arthopyreniaceae, but molecular phylogenetics studies showed that the type species, Arthopyrenia cerasi, was a member of the Trypetheliaceae. Arthopyrenia fungi typically form inconspicuous films embedded within tree bark and produce tiny, flask-shaped fruiting bodies covered by dark, shield-like caps. The genus includes both lichen-forming species (those that partner with algae) and non-lichenized species, with about 100 currently recognized species found primarily on bark and wood substrates.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen thrives in consistently high humidity with indirect to partial shade, replicating its native humid subtropical forest habitat. It absorbs moisture directly from the air, thus frequent misting or moist air exposure is crucial. No traditional fertilization is needed, as it acquires necessary nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no external fertilization required. Lichens acquire necessary nutrients from the air and precipitation; excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
