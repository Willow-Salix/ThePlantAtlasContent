## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western and Central United States (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Semi-Arid Grasslands/Prairies |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed areas with no canopy cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent and deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant due to its arid native environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Machaeranthera is a genus of North American flowering plants in the family Asteraceae which are known by the common name tansyaster.
Tansyasters are variable in appearance. Some are small, singular wildflowers, while others are sprawling shrubs. Several species easily hybridize with each other, as well, making identification difficult. In general, members of the genus may be identified by the sharp-pointed, dagger-shaped anthers in the disc florets at the center of the flower. The flower heads are usually daisylike, and are usually a shade of purple or blue, but may be pink, yellow, or white. Tansyasters are native to western North America.
The genus Machaeranthera is distinguished from the genus Dieteria by having once- or twice-pinnate leaves, whereas Dieteria has entire to toothed leaves.
Machaeranthera means "swordlike anthers".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, reflecting its arid grassland origins. Ensure extremely well-draining soil to prevent root rot, as it is accustomed to dry conditions. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Native soils are typically lean; excessive fertilization can be detrimental. A very light, balanced fertilizer once a year, if at all, is sufficient.
