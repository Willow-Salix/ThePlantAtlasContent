## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Indian subcontinent (India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh) and parts of Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam), Southwest China |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Monsoon Climate (characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers ample direct sunlight, especially as a mature tree, but can tolerate some shade, particularly when young. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular and consistent watering during its active growing season, mimicking monsoon rains. Allow the soil to dry out moderately between waterings, as it is adapted to periods of drought in its native dry season. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ficus ( or ) is a genus of about 850 species of woody trees, shrubs, vines, epiphytes and hemiepiphytes in the family Moraceae. Collectively known as fig trees or figs, they are native throughout the tropics with a few species extending into the semi-warm temperate zone. The common fig (F. carica) is a temperate species native to southwest Asia and the Mediterranean region (from Afghanistan  to Portugal), which has been widely cultivated from ancient times for its fruit, also referred to as figs. The fruit of most other species are also edible though they are usually of only local economic importance or eaten as bushfood. However, they are extremely important food resources for wildlife. Figs are also of considerable cultural importance throughout the tropics, both as objects of worship and for their many practical uses.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Peepul Tree thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical monsoon climate with full sun exposure and ample water during its growing season, followed by a drier period. Ensure well-draining soil and provide moderate fertilization during active growth to support its vigorous development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer. Less frequent or no fertilization during its dormant period.
