## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian native thrives in conditions mimicking its wet to mesic forest origin, requiring consistently moist, well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. High humidity is beneficial, and it appreciates moderate fertilization during its active growth period to support healthy foliage.
