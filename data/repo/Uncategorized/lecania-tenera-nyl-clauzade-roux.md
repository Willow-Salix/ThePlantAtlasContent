## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in temperate regions of Europe and North America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate, often found in areas with good air quality and atmospheric humidity, typically on calcareous substrates |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. As an epilithic lichen, it grows on exposed rock surfaces, tolerating considerable light but benefiting from some protection from intense, direct sun to prevent desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies on atmospheric humidity and rainfall for moisture. Requires regular rehydration through misting or natural rain; tolerates dry periods but needs to rehydrate to remain active. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecania is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. Lecania is widely distributed, especially in temperate regions, and contains about 65 species. These lichens form thin, crusty growths on various surfaces and produce small disc-shaped fruiting bodies that are typically brown to black in colour. Most species reproduce both sexually through spores and asexually through tiny reproductive structures, allowing them to spread effectively in their environments.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate lichen thrives in areas with good air quality and atmospheric humidity, typically on calcareous rock. It requires bright indirect to partial sun and absorbs moisture from the air or misting, not needing traditional watering or fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and substrate minerals; external fertilizers can be detrimental.
