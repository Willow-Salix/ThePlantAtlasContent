## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort thrives in consistently cool, moist, and deeply shaded environments, mimicking its native temperate forest understory. Ensure high humidity and never allow the substrate to dry out, while providing very low, indirect light. Fertilization is generally not required and should be minimal if applied.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. If fertilized, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly (e.g., once or twice a year at 1/10th strength).
