## 🧤 Care Instructions
Porter's goldenrod thrives in temperate climates, preferring full to partial sun and very well-drained, dry soil conditions. It is highly drought tolerant once established, requiring minimal supplemental water. Fertilizer needs are low, as rich soils can cause excessive growth and flopping.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; generally not required in average to poor soil. Excessive fertilizer can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
