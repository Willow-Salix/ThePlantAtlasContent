## 🌱 Overview
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bryum crassirameum thrives in deeply shaded, consistently moist, and highly humid conditions, replicating its natural forest floor habitat. It requires no direct sunlight and the substrate should never dry out. Fertilization is typically unnecessary and can be detrimental to its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally no fertilizer is needed. Mosses absorb nutrients from their environment; excess nutrients can harm them.
