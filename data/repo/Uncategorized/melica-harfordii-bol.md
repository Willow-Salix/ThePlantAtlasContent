## 🌱 Overview
Melica is a genus of perennial grasses known generally as melic or melic grass. They are found in most temperate regions of the world.

Melic grasses are clumping to short-rhizomatous grasses. They have flowering culms up to 250 cm (98 in) tall bearing spikelets of papery flowers. The spikelets have between one and seven fertile flowers with a rudimentary structure at the distal end composed of one to four sterile florets. Some species of melic have corms, lending them the name oniongrass.
The genus is most diverse in South America and temperate Asia. Eight species are endemic to China. In North America, most species occur west of the Mississippi River, with exceptions being Melica mutica and M. nitens which occur throughout much of the southeast and lower Midwest respectively.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Harford's Oniongrass thrives in full sun to partial shade, mimicking its native Mediterranean woodland and chaparral environment. Provide moderate water during its spring growth period, then allow it to dry out, as it is highly drought-tolerant in summer. Fertilize sparingly in spring to support healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, primarily in spring; prefers lean to average soils and does not require rich nutrients.
