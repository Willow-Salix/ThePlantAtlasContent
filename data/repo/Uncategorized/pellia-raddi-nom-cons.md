## 🌱 Overview
Pellia is a small but widespread genus of liverworts in the cool and temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.  It is classified in order  Pelliales and is a member of the family  Pelliaceae within that order.
Süsswassertang, a plant grown submerged in aquaria was once considered to be Pellia endiviifolia, but is now known to be the indeterminate gametophyte of a Lomariopsis species, a type of fern. Pellia liverworts are also often confused with Monosolenium tenerum, another liverwort.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pellia thrives in cool, consistently moist, and highly humid environments with very low indirect light, mimicking its natural habitat on forest floors or near water bodies. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging while keeping the substrate damp, and avoid strong direct sunlight at all costs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very minimal to no fertilizer. If desired, a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/8 strength) can be applied very sparingly, perhaps once a month during active growth.
