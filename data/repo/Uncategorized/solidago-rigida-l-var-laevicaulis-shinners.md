## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stiff Goldenrod thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native prairie environment. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization. This robust plant is generally drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal maintenance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization; excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
