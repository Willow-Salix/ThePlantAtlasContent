## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort thrives in consistently moist, highly humid environments with low to partial light, mimicking its native damp, temperate habitats. Avoid direct sunlight and strong fertilizers, as bryophytes have very minimal nutrient needs and are sensitive to chemical inputs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; minimal to no fertilization is typically required, as bryophytes absorb nutrients from dilute solutions and rainfall.
