## 🌱 Overview
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, Mountain Saxifrage requires bright light (with some afternoon shade in warm areas) and consistently moist, exceptionally well-drained soil. Over-fertilization should be avoided, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky environments. Mimicking its cool, high-altitude native conditions is key to its success.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer is needed. Alpine plants are adapted to lean soils; excessive nutrients can be detrimental. If desired, use a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once early in the growing season.
