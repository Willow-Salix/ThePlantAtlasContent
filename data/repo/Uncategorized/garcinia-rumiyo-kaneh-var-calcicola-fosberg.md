## 🌱 Overview
Garcinia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Clusiaceae native to the Sundaland bioregion of Asia, America, Australia, tropical and southern Africa, and Polynesia. The number of species is disputed; Plants of the World Online (POWO) recognise up to 400. Commonly, the plants in this genus are called saptrees, mangosteens (which may also refer specifically to Garcinia mangostana), or garcinias, and is one of several plants known as by the name "monkey fruit". The genus is named after French botanist Laurent Garcin (1683–1751).
Trees of many species from this genus tend to grow deep in forested areas where other plants grow nearby. They are threatened by habitat destruction, and at least one species, G. cadelliana, from South Andaman Island, is almost or even completely extinct already.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Garcinia variety thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical rainforest origin, requiring partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Regular, diluted fertilization during active growth will support its health, while avoiding direct sun is crucial.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize monthly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler, dormant periods.
