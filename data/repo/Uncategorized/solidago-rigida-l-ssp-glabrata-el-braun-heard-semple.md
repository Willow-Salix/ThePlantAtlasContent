## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stiff Goldenrod thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its native prairie habitat. It requires moderate watering during establishment but becomes drought-tolerant once mature. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it prefers average to lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Thrives in average to poor soils; excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth.
