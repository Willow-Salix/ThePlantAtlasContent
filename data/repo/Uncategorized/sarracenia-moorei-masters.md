## 🌱 Overview

The traps of what are considered to be "true" pitcher plants are formed by specialized leaves. The plants attract and drown the prey with nectar.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sarracenia Ã—moorei thrives in conditions mimicking its native bog habitat: constant full sun and consistently wet, nutrient-poor soil. Use only pure water (distilled, RO, or rainwater) and never fertilize the soil, as the plant acquires its nutrients from insects.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. These carnivorous plants obtain nutrients from insects they catch. Fertilizing the soil can burn the roots and kill the plant.
