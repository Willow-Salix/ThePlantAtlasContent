## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical plant thrives in conditions similar to its native Philippine rainforests, requiring abundant light and consistent moisture. Ensure well-draining soil and provide moderate fertilization during its active growth period to support its vigorous nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen may not be necessary.
