## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arctic-alpine grass is adapted to very cold, exposed environments. It requires full sun during its short active growing season and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Due to its native habitat, it needs minimal to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Tundra soils are naturally nutrient-poor. If absolutely necessary, a highly diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once early in the brief growing season.
