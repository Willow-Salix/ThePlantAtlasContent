## 🧤 Care Instructions
The San Luis Obispo Flannel Bush thrives in full sun with excellent drainage, mirroring its native California Mediterranean climate. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal to no summer water, as overwatering is a common cause of decline. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization to ensure robust health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils found in its native chaparral habitat and generally does not require fertilization once established. Over-fertilizing can promote weak, leggy growth.
