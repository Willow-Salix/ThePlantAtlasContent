## 🌱 Overview
Valeriana is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae, members of which may be commonly known as valerians. It contains many species, including the garden valerian, Valeriana officinalis. Valeriana has centers of diversity in Eurasia and South America (especially in the Andes), and is represented by native species on all continents except Antarctica.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Longspur Seablush is an annual wildflower adapted to Mediterranean climates, requiring full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Provide consistent moisture during its spring growth period, allowing it to dry out as it completes its life cycle in early summer. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it prefers lean to average soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to somewhat poor soils, as found in its native chaparral and grassland habitats; excessive fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
