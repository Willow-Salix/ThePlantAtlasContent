| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-arid Grassland/Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings; highly drought-tolerant once established, mimicking its native dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Mimosa is a genus of about 600 species of herbs and shrubs, in the mimosoid clade of the legume family Fabaceae. Species are native to the Americas, from North Dakota to northern Argentina, and to eastern Africa (Tanzania, Mozambique, and Madagascar) as well as the Indian subcontinent and Indochina. The generic name is derived from the Greek word μῖμος (mimos), 'actor' or 'mime', and the feminine suffix -osa, 'resembling', suggesting its 'sensitive leaves' which seem to 'mimic conscious life'.
Two species in the genus are especially notable. One is Mimosa pudica, commonly known as touch-me-not, which folds its leaves when touched or exposed to heat. It is native to southern Central and South America but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value, both as a houseplant in temperate areas, and outdoors in the tropics. Outdoor cultivation has led to weedy invasion in some areas, notably Hawaii. The other is Mimosa tenuiflora, which is best known for its use in shamanic ayahuasca brews due to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine found in its root bark.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Softleaf Mimosa thrives in full sun and is very drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established. It needs minimal fertilization, preferring well-draining soils common in its native arid to semi-arid regions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or none at all, as legumes fix their own nitrogen.
