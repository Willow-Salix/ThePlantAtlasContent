## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal Southern California, United States (including Channel Islands) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential to mimic its open scrubland habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly and infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during the dry summer months. |

## 🌱 Overview
Monardella is a genus of approximately 40 species of annual and perennial plants native to western North America from British Columbia to northwestern Mexico. They are grown for their highly aromatic foliage, which in some species is used for herbal teas. The two-lipped, tubular flowers are formed in terminal clusters and are most usually red, pink, or purple.
Monardella is a Latin diminutive form of Monarda (a taxonomic patronym honoring the Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes), which the form of the flower heads resembles.  Plants in this genus are commonly known as wildmints, coyote mints or monardellas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native thrives in its Mediterranean scrubland environment, requiring abundant full sun and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering, particularly in summer, and minimal fertilization to mimic its natural, low-nutrient conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils; over-fertilization can be detrimental. A very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring, if at all, is sufficient.
