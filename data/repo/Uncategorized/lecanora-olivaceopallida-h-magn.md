## 🌱 Overview
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in temperate woodlands on tree bark, requiring bright, open conditions and periodic moisture. It should be allowed to dry completely between wettings, as it naturally obtains all necessary nutrients from its environment without the need for fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No supplemental fertilization is needed; lichens absorb nutrients directly from the air and precipitation.
