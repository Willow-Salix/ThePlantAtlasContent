## 🧤 Care Instructions
Buffalo Grass is a resilient, drought-tolerant turfgrass best suited for full sun and well-drained conditions. It requires minimal watering once established and generally needs little to no fertilizer, making it an excellent choice for low-maintenance landscapes in arid to semi-arid regions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. It generally thrives without supplemental feeding; a light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer or top-dressing with compost in spring is sufficient if growth appears poor.
