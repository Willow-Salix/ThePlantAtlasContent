## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | New Zealand, Eastern Australia (Queensland, New South Wales), and various Pacific Islands (e.g., Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, Hawaii, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Rainforests and Wet Sclerophyll Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers bright, indirect light, mimicking its natural habitat beneath a forest canopy or growing on tree trunks. Direct sun, especially harsh afternoon sun, will scorch its fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist conditions but with excellent drainage. As an epiphyte, it appreciates frequent watering (often daily in hot weather) and very high humidity, but its roots should not sit in standing water. Allow the top layer of the growing medium to dry slightly between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Asplenium is a genus of about 700 species of ferns, often treated as the only genus in the family Aspleniaceae, though other authors consider Hymenasplenium separate, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, a different chromosome count, and structural differences in the rhizomes. The type species for the genus is Asplenium marinum.
The most common vernacular name is spleenworts, applied to the more "typical" species. A. nidus and several similar species are called bird's-nest ferns, the Camptosorus group is known as walking ferns, and distinct names are applied to some other particularly well-known species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic fern thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, typical of its native rainforest understory. Maintain consistent moisture without waterlogging, and provide occasional diluted fertilizer during active growth for healthy fronds, ensuring good air circulation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder. Apply a diluted liquid fertilizer (quarter to half strength) once every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease feeding in winter.
