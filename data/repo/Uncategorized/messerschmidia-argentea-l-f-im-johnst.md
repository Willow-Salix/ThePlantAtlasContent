## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific, including East Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia, and various Pacific Islands (e.g., Hawaii, Fiji) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Coastal |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to bright direct light. This plant thrives in exposed, high-light environments typical of beaches and open coastal areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Native to areas with regular rainfall but well-draining sandy/coralline soils, it prefers consistently moist soil but tolerates brief dry periods. Allow the top soil to dry out between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Tournefortia, often called soldierbushes, is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae.
It was first published under the name "Pittonia" by Charles Plumier in 1703, in honour of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, Carl Linnaeus changed the name to Tournefortia, on the grounds that Tournefort was virtually unknown by his family name outside France.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical coastal plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native beach habitat. Water regularly to keep the soil consistently moist, but allow the top layer to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilize sparingly, as it is naturally adapted to less fertile environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to nutrient-poor coastal soils, it does not require heavy fertilization. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer or slow-release granules once or twice during the growing season should suffice.
