## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Arizona, Nevada) and Baja California, Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean and Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during dormant periods, but provide more water during active growth and blooming seasons. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus sparsiflorus (Coulter's lupine) is a species of lupin native to North America. In the United States it occurs in  California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah, and in Mexico it is found in Baja California and Sonora. Other common names include Mojave lupine, a name it shares with Lupinus odoratus.
This is an annual herb growing 20 to 40 centimetres tall. Each palmate leaf is made up of 7 to 11 very narrow leaflets up to 3 centimetres long and just a few millimetres wide. The inflorescence is a spiral of several flowers each around a centimetre long. The flower is blue or purple, becoming darker with age, with a white to pink patch on its banner.
The desert lupine flower is pale blue or purple. The upper petal (banner) has a yellow spot which changes to reddish after pollination. The two bottom petals (keel) are short and wide, hairy on the bottom edge and curve upward to a slender tip. When ripe, the seed pods explode, scattering their seed in the wind.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Coulter's Lupine requires full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its native open and dry scrubland environments. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing infrequent watering, and due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it thrives with little to no supplemental fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen, thriving in poor to moderate soils. Avoid nitrogen-rich fertilizers, which can inhibit flowering; if necessary, use a phosphorus-potassium rich blend very sparingly.
