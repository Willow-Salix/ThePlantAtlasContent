## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Fanleaf Hawthorn thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring moderate watering to establish and during dry spells. It is adaptable to various soil types and does not demand heavy fertilization, making it a robust and relatively low-maintenance woody plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder, but benefits from an annual application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in early spring, especially in nutrient-poor soils.
