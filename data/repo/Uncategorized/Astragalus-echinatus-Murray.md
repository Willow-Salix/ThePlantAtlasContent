## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, including Southeastern Europe (e.g., Greece, Italy, Albania) and parts of Turkey. |

| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive in conditions mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during warmer months. Requires more water during its active growing season (cooler months) but still needs excellent drainage. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient Mediterranean native thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for xeriscaping or dry gardens. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and provide minimal fertilization, particularly avoiding excess nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all, is usually sufficient. Avoid high nitrogen fertilizers as it's a legume.
