## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its arid scrubland origins. Water moderately during cooler growing months, ensuring the soil dries completely between waterings, and largely withhold water during summer dormancy. It requires minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities and adaptation to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen and thrives in lean soils. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if needed.
