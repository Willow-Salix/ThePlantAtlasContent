## 🌱 Overview
Salacca is a genus of about 20 species of palms native to Southeast Asia and the eastern Himalayas. They are dioecious (with the exception of Salak Bali) and pollinated by Curculionidae beetles.
They are very short-stemmed palms, with leaves up to 6–8 m long. The leaves have a spiny petiole; in most species they are pinnate with numerous leaflets, but some species, notably S. magnifica, have undivided leaves. The fruit grow in clusters at the base of the plants, and are edible in many species, with a reddish-brown scaly skin covering a white pulp and one to two large inedible seeds. The Salak (S. zalacca) or snake fruit is the species most widely grown for its fruit; the firm white pulp has a slight acidic taste. The skin of the snakefruit has a unique texture not unlike that of a snake's skin, rough to the touch in one direction but smooth in the other.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Salak Palm thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Ensure high humidity and regular fertilization during its growing period to emulate its native tropical rainforest environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a liquid tropical plant fertilizer during the active growing season.
