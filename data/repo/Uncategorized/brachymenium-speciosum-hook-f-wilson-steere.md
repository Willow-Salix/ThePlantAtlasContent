# Brachymenium Moss
### *Brachymenium speciosum (Hook. f. & Wilson) Steere*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions across America, Africa, Asia, and Australasia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light, consistent with a forest understory; avoid direct harsh sunlight to prevent desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity and consistently moist substrate, mimicking frequent rainfall and high atmospheric moisture of its native habitat; never allow to dry out completely, but also ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Brachymenium moss thrives in consistently moist, humid conditions with low to indirect light, similar to its native tropical and subtropical forest floor habitat. Ensure high ambient humidity and a consistently damp, but not soggy, substrate, avoiding direct sun. Fertilization is generally not necessary or should be extremely sparse and diluted.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is required; mosses generally have low nutrient demands and can be harmed by excessive salts. If desired, an extremely diluted liquid feed (e.g., 1/8th strength) could be applied very rarely.
