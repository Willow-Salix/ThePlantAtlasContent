## 🌱 Overview
Tradescantia () is a genus of 85 species of herbaceous perennial wildflowers in the family Commelinaceae, native to the Americas from southern Canada to northern Argentina, including the West Indies. Members of the genus are known by many common names, including inchplant, wandering jew, spiderwort, dayflower and trad.
Tradescantia grow 30–60 cm  tall (1–2 ft), and are commonly found individually or in clumps in wooded areas and open fields. They were introduced into Europe as ornamental plants in the 17th century and are now grown in many parts of the world. Some species have become naturalized in regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and on some oceanic islands.
The genus's many species are of interest to cytogenetics because of evolutionary changes in the structure and number of their chromosomes. They have also been used as bioindicators for the detection of environmental mutagens. Some species have become pests to cultivated crops and considered invasive.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ephemerum moss thrives in consistently moist, shaded conditions, mimicking its natural habitat on temperate forest floors or disturbed moist ground. Provide a humid environment and ensure good drainage to prevent rot, while avoiding direct sun and heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. If growth appears poor, use an extremely diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly, once a year at most.
