## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Aleutian Islands (Alaska, USA), Alaska Peninsula, coastal British Columbia (Canada), Washington (USA), and parts of Chukotka (Russia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, exposed locations typical of its native alpine habitat, where it receives ample light due to lack of tree canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist but very well-drained soil. Its native environment often provides moisture from snowmelt and summer rains, but rocky substrates ensure quick drainage, preventing waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Aleutian Saxifrage thrives in cool, alpine conditions with full to partial sun exposure. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil to mimic its native habitat with snowmelt and rain, yet good drainage is crucial. This plant has very low fertilizer demands, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor rocky environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Its native habitat features nutrient-poor, rocky soils, indicating that it is adapted to lean conditions and excessive fertilization can be harmful.
