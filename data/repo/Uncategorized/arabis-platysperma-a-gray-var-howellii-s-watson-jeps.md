## 🧤 Care Instructions
Howell's Pioneer Rockcress thrives in bright, open conditions with well-drained soil, replicating its montane native habitat. Provide moderate and consistent moisture, especially during active growth, but avoid overwatering to prevent root issues. Minimal fertilization is generally sufficient for this hardy species.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Being a pioneer species often found in rocky, sometimes serpentine soils, it is adapted to less fertile conditions. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may benefit plants in very poor soils.
