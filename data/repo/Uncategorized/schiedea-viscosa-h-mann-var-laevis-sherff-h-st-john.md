## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian native thrives in bright, sunny conditions reminiscent of its cliffside origin. Allow its well-draining soil to dry completely between waterings, as it's adapted to periods of drought. Provide light, balanced fertilizer during active growth to support its moderate nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer due to its adaptation to moderate-nutrient volcanic soils.
