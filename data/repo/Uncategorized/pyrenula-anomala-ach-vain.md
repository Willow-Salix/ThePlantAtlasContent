## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wart Lichen thrives in highly humid, shaded environments, needing consistent moisture from misting or a naturally humid climate. It should be protected from direct sunlight and does not require traditional fertilization, as it absorbs nutrients from its surroundings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens absorb trace nutrients directly from the air and substrate, and traditional fertilization can be detrimental.
