## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Sclerophora coniophaea, provide a stable environment with low to indirect light and consistently high humidity, mimicking its native old-growth forest habitat. Avoid direct sun and never apply traditional fertilizers, as these can be detrimental to its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
