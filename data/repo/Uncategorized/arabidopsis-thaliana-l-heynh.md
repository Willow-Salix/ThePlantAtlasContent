## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and northwestern Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate zones, often found in open, disturbed habitats like fields, roadsides, and forest edges. |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun for optimal growth, but can tolerate partial shade, especially in regions with intense summer heat. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil; water moderately when the top inch of soil feels dry, as it is sensitive to both waterlogging and prolonged drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arabidopsis (rockcress) is a genus of small flowering plants in the cabbage and mustard family, Brassicaceae. Arabidopsis species are native to temperate and subarctic Eurasia and North America, North Africa, and the mountains of eastern tropical Africa. This genus is of great interest since it contains thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), one of the model organisms used for studying plant biology and the first plant to have its entire genome sequenced. Changes in thale cress are easily observed, making it a very useful model.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Arabidopsis thaliana thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It benefits from moderate fertilization to support its rapid growth cycle. Ensure good drainage and avoid extremes of wet or dry conditions for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
A light feeder, but benefits from a balanced, moderate fertilizer application during its active growth period, particularly in nutrient-poor soils.
