### *Ochrolechia xanthostoma (Sommerf.) K. Schmitz & Lumbsch*

![No widely recognized common name](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Ochrolechia_parella.jpg)

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Scandinavia, Greenland, Alaska, northern Canada, and mountainous areas of temperate regions. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic-Alpine and Boreal (Cold Temperate), characterized by cold temperatures, exposed conditions, and periods of snow cover and atmospheric moisture. |
| **☀️ Light** | High light exposure, tolerant of direct sun often found on open rock surfaces in its natural habitat. Requires cool temperatures and good air circulation. |
| **💧 Water** | Does not require soil watering. Relies entirely on atmospheric moisture (rain, snowmelt, fog, dew). Requires high ambient humidity and occasional wetting, followed by drying periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ochrolechia is the sole genus in the fungal family Ochrolechiaceae. It comprises about 40 species of crustose lichens. These lichens typically form uneven, often thick, crust-like growths on various surfaces and are characterised by their white to pale grey thalli, which may have a greenish tint. The genus has a long evolutionary history, with fossils dating back to the Paleogene period, about 34 million years ago. Ochrolechia species have disc-like apothecia (fruiting bodies), which are usually yellowish or brownish-pink and often covered with a fine white powdery coating. The genus is widely distributed and includes both common and rare species, with some found in extreme environments such as arctic and alpine regions. Ochrolechia lichens produce diverse secondary metabolites, including orcinol depsides, depsidones, and xanthones.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Caring for this lichen involves mimicking its native arctic-alpine habitat: providing cool, bright conditions with high atmospheric humidity and good air circulation, ideally on a suitable mineral substrate. Avoid conventional watering and fertilizers, as it relies on atmospheric moisture and nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No conventional fertilizer needed. Obtains necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rain) and mineral traces from its rock substrate. Sensitive to air pollution.
