## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical and subtropical native flourishes in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it needs minimal to moderate fertilization, primarily for other essential nutrients, especially during its growing season.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, reducing the need for nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied lightly during the growing season if soil is poor.
