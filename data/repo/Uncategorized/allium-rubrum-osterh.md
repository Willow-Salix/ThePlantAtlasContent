## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including states like Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, and Colorado. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine, characterized by cold winters, moist springs from snowmelt, and often drier summers. It is found in moist meadows, open forests, and rocky slopes. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. It thrives in open, sunny locations in its native habitat, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is required during its active growing period in spring and early summer. Allow the soil to dry out significantly, or even completely, as the plant enters dormancy in late summer and fall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Allium is a large genus of monocotyledonous flowering plants with around 1000 accepted species, making Allium the largest genus in the family Amaryllidaceae and among the largest plant genera in the world. Many of the species are edible, and some have a long history of cultivation and human consumption as a vegetable including the onion, garlic, scallions, shallots, leeks, and chives.
Allium species occur in temperate climates of the Northern Hemisphere, except for a few species occurring in Chile (such as A. juncifolium), Brazil (A. sellovianum), and tropical Africa (A. spathaceum). They vary in height between 5–150 centimetres (2–59 in). The flowers form an umbel at the top of a leafless stalk. The bulbs vary in size between species, from small (around 2–3 mm in diameter) to rather large (8–10 cm). Some species (such as Welsh onion A. fistulosum and leeks (A. ampeloprasum)) develop thickened leaf-bases rather than forming bulbs as such.
Carl Linnaeus first described the genus Allium in 1753. The generic name Allium is the Latin word for garlic, and the type species for the genus is Allium sativum which means "cultivated garlic". The decision to include a species in the genus Allium is taxonomically difficult, and species boundaries are unclear. Estimates of the number of species are as low as 260, and as high as 979. In the APG III classification system, Allium is placed in the family Amaryllidaceae, subfamily Allioideae (formerly the family Alliaceae).  In some of the older classification systems, Allium was placed in Liliaceae. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown this circumscription of Liliaceae is not monophyletic.

Various Allium species have been cultivated from the earliest times. About a dozen species are economically important as crops, or garden vegetables, and an increasing number of species are important as ornamental plants. Plants of the genus produce chemical compounds, mostly derived from cysteine sulfoxides, that give them a characteristic onion or garlic taste and odor. Many are used as food plants, though not all members of the genus are equally flavorful. In most cases, both bulb and leaves are edible. The characteristic Allium flavor depends on the sulfate content of the soil the plant grows in. In the rare occurrence of sulfur-free growth conditions, all Allium species completely lose their usual pungency.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This perennial bulb thrives in cool, temperate montane environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. Provide regular watering during its spring and early summer growth phase, then allow it to dry out for summer dormancy. It is a relatively low-maintenance plant that does not require heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer application in early spring as new growth emerges is generally sufficient, especially if the soil is poor.
