## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | East Africa (Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers bright, direct sunlight; can tolerate some partial shade but thrives in high light conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic its native drought conditions. Overwatering leads to root rot. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in bright, direct sunlight, reflective of its arid East African origins. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between sessions, and has minimal fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Feed sparingly (once or twice during the growing season) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength.
