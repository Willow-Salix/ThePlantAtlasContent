## 🌱 Overview
Tephrosia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is widespread in both the Eastern and Western Hemisphere, where it is found in tropical and warm-temperate regions.
The generic name is derived from the Greek word τεφρος (tephros), meaning "ash-colored," referring to the greyish tint given to the leaves by their dense trichomes. Hoarypea is a common name for plants in this genus, along with goat's rue and devil's shoestring.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils, characteristic of its native subtropical woodlands. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between sessions, and avoid heavy fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen and thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. If desired, a very light, balanced fertilizer (low in nitrogen) can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
