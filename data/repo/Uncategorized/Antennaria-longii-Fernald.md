## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including the Pacific Northwest (USA and Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine (dry meadows, open woodlands, slopes) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for best growth and flowering, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Requires well-drained soil; very susceptible to root rot in waterlogged conditions. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially once established. Drought-tolerant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in well-drained, lean soils and prefers full sun exposure, reflecting its native montane and subalpine habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization to prevent root rot and encourage healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in lean, poor soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental. A very light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, or none at all, is usually sufficient.
