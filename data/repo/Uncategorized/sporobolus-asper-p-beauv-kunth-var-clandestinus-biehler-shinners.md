## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Eastern United States |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Open Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun for optimal growth, thriving in open, exposed environments typical of prairies and fields. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and can withstand periods of dryness, reflecting its adaptation to regions with periodic dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sporobolus is a nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. The name Sporobolus means "seed-thrower", and is derived from Ancient Greek word σπόρος (spóros), meaning "seed", and the root of βάλλειν (bállein) "to throw", referring to the dispersion of seeds. Members of the genus are usually called dropseeds or sacaton grasses. They are typical prairie and savanna plants, occurring in other types of open habitat in warmer climates. At least one species (S. caespitosus from Saint Helena) is threatened with extinction, and another (S. durus from Ascension Island) is extinct.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This robust native grass thrives in full sun and is highly adaptable to various soil conditions, including those of low fertility. It requires moderate watering during establishment but becomes very drought-tolerant, making it a low-maintenance plant suited for naturalized areas or xeriscaping.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. It is adapted to average to poor soils and typically does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if desired.
