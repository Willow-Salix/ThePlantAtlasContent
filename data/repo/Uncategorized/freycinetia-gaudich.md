## 🧤 Care Instructions
Freycinetia thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest habitat, requiring consistently moist soil and high humidity. Provide indirect bright light or partial shade, and fertilize sparingly during active growth to support its climbing nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize lightly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
