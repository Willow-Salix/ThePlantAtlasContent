| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (specifically, desert regions of California, Nevada, and Arizona) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure, tolerant of intense direct sunlight typical of desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings; highly drought-tolerant and sensitive to overwatering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Camissonia, sometimes commonly known as sun cup or sundrop, is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the evening primrose family Onagraceae. A total of 12 species are known, nearly all from western North America, especially in the California Floristic Province, but also one from South America. Previous circumscriptions of the genus had recognized up to 62 species before it was split among other closely related genera.
The flowers generally open at dawn and are yellow. They are usually cup-shaped, thus the common name.
Formerly included in Oenothera, the species of Camissonia are distinguished by having a club- or head-shaped stigma, instead of the 4-part-divided stigma of Oenothera or Clarkia.
Camissonia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia cupes and Schinia deserticola, both of which feed on C. claviformis, the latter exclusively.
The genus is named after the botanist Adelbert von Chamisso.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of arid scrublands. It requires very infrequent watering, as it is highly drought-tolerant, and has low fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Requires minimal fertilization, perhaps a very diluted, balanced fertilizer once or twice during its active growing season if potted.
