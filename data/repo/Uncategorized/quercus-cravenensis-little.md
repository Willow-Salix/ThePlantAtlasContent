# Craven Oak
### *Quercus Ã—cravenensis Little*

![Craven Oak](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Quercus_robur.jpg)

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States, particularly coastal plains and lower elevation forests where its parent species (Quercus michauxii and Quercus virginiana) overlap. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Climate, characterized by warm to hot, humid summers and mild winters, with relatively consistent year-round rainfall, found within temperate broadleaf and mixed forest biomes. |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth, consistent with its parent species which are large, open-canopy trees. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during establishment. Once mature, it exhibits good drought tolerance, reflecting the adaptive traits from its parent species. Water deeply during prolonged dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
An oak is a hardwood tree or shrub in the genus Quercus of the beech family. They have spirally arranged leaves, often with lobed edges, and a nut called an acorn, borne within a cup. The genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, with some 500 species, both deciduous and evergreen. Fossil oaks date back to the Middle Eocene. Molecular phylogeny shows that the genus is divided into Old World and New World clades, but many oak species hybridise freely, making the genus's history difficult to resolve.
Ecologically, oaks are keystone species in habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest. They live in association with many kinds of fungi including truffles. Oaks support more than 950 species of caterpillar, many kinds of gall wasp which form distinctive galls (roundish woody lumps such as the oak apple), and a large number of pests and diseases. Oak leaves and acorns contain enough tannin to be toxic to cattle, but pigs are able to digest them safely. Oak timber is strong and hard, and has found many uses in construction and furniture-making. The bark was traditionally used for tanning leather. Wine barrels are made of oak; these are used for aging alcoholic beverages such as sherry and whisky, giving them a range of flavours, colours, and aromas. The spongy bark of the cork oak is used to make traditional wine bottle corks. Almost a third of oak species are threatened with extinction due to climate change, invasive pests, and habitat loss.
In culture, the oak tree is a symbol of strength and serves as the national tree of many countries. In Indo-European and related religions, the oak is associated with thunder gods. Individual oak trees of cultural significance include the Royal Oak in Britain, the Charter Oak in the United States, and the Guernica Oak in the Basque Country.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Craven Oak is a resilient hybrid best suited for the humid subtropical conditions of the southeastern US. It requires full sun and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, though it becomes quite drought tolerant once established. Minimal fertilization is generally needed for mature trees in good soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to rich, well-drained soils. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring for young trees or in nutrient-deficient soils, but established trees typically require little to no supplemental fertilization.
