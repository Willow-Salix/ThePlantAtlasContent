## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in consistently cool, moist, and humid environments, mimicking its native temperate rainforest habitat. Provide indirect light and ensure very high ambient humidity, as it absorbs moisture directly from the air. Traditional fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers; obtains necessary nutrients from the air and its substrate (e.g., tree bark).
