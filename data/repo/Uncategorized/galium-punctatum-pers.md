## 🌱 Overview
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Mediterranean native thrives in full sun with well-draining soil, adapted to dry summer conditions. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Fertilize lightly during the growing season to support its moderate nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; minimal fertilization is needed, typically once a year or every other year in spring, especially in poor soils.
