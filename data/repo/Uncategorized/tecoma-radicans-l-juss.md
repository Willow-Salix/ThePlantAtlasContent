## 🌱 Overview
Campsis, commonly known as trumpet creeper or trumpet vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae, native to woodlands in China and North America. It consists of two species, both of which are vigorous deciduous perennial climbers, clinging by aerial roots, and producing large trumpet-shaped flowers in the summer. They are reasonably hardy and do well with the support of a wall, preferring full sun.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Trumpet Vine is a vigorous climber best suited for full sun to partial shade, which encourages abundant flowering. While it needs moderate watering during establishment, it becomes very drought-tolerant as it matures. Avoid over-fertilizing to ensure a profusion of blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average soil and often requires little to no supplemental fertilizer. Excessive fertilization can promote foliage growth at the expense of flowers.
