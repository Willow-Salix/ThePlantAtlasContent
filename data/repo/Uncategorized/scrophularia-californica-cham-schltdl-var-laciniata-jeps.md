| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (primarily California, USA, and Baja California, Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Woodland/Riparian |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial Shade to Full Sun; tolerates full sun in cooler coastal areas, prefers partial shade inland or in hotter climates to protect foliage from scorching. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering, especially during dry summer periods, to maintain consistently moist soil. Does not tolerate prolonged drought, reflecting its native habitat near water sources. |

## 🌱 Overview
The genus Scrophularia of the family Scrophulariaceae comprises about 200 species of herbaceous flowering plants commonly known as figworts. Species of Scrophularia all share square stems, opposite leaves and open two-lipped flowers forming clusters at the end of their stems. The genus is found throughout the Northern Hemisphere.
Scrophularia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Phymatopus hectoides.
Some species in this genus are known to contain potentially useful substances, such as iridoids, and several Scrophularia species, such as the Ningpo figwort (S. ningpoensis), have been used by herbal medicine practitioners around the world. The name Scrophularia comes from scrofula, a form of tuberculosis, because several species have been used in herbal medicine for this disease.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates with consistently moist soil, typically found along stream banks or woodland edges. It prefers partial shade, especially in hotter regions, but can tolerate more sun in cooler areas. Provide regular watering during dry periods and light fertilization to encourage robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring or summer is sufficient, especially in poorer soils, as its native soils are typically moderately fertile with organic matter.
