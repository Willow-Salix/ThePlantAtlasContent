## 🌱 Overview
An arrowhead or point is the usually sharpened and hardened tip of an arrow, which contributes a majority of the projectile mass and is responsible for impacting and penetrating a target, or sometimes for special purposes such as signaling.
The earliest arrowheads were made of stone and of organic materials; as human civilizations progressed, other alloy materials were used.  Arrowheads are important archaeological artifacts; they are a subclass of projectile points.  Modern enthusiasts still "produce over one million brand-new spear and arrow points per year".
A craftsman who manufactures arrowheads is called an arrowsmith.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Arrowhead plants thrive in constantly wet conditions, either submerged in shallow water or in saturated soil, mimicking their natural wetland habitat. They prefer full sun to partial shade and benefit from a nutrient-rich growing medium to support their vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high fertilization, ideally through a nutrient-rich substrate or slow-release aquatic plant tabs.
