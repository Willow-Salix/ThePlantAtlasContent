# Peanut Cactus
### *Chamaeceros fertilis Milde, non Carpolipum fertile Lehm.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northwestern Argentina (Tucumán and Salta provinces) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Montane Scrubland / Semi-Arid Mountainous |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun to bright indirect light. Can tolerate some direct morning sun but may need protection from intense afternoon sun in very hot climates to prevent scorching. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant. Water thoroughly when the soil is completely dry to the touch, then allow to dry out again. Reduce watering significantly in winter during dormancy. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Peanut Cactus thrives in conditions mimicking its native semi-arid mountainous environment, requiring abundant light and minimal water. Ensure excellent drainage and infrequent watering, especially in winter, to prevent rot. Fertilize sparingly during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Feed with a diluted cactus-specific fertilizer once a month during the active growing season (spring/summer) and abstain during dormancy.
