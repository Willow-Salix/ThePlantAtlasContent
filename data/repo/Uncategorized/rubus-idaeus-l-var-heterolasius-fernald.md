## 🧤 Care Instructions
Red Raspberries thrive in temperate climates, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimic their native forest edge habitat by providing regular watering, especially during dry spells, and moderate feeding with organic matter or a balanced fertilizer in early spring for optimal growth and fruit production.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding. Amend soil with compost or well-rotted manure annually in early spring. Alternatively, use a balanced slow-release fertilizer formulated for berries.
