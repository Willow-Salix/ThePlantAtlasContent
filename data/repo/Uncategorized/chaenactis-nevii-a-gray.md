## 🌱 Overview
Chaenactis is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae which are known generally as pincushions and dustymaidens.
These wildflowers are native to western North America, especially the desert southwest of the United States. They are quite variable in appearance. They are generally aster-like in appearance with many disc florets in each head. There may be only disc florets, but sometimes there are also enlarged ray florets along the edges of the corolla. They may be white to yellow or pink.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
John Day's Pincushion thrives in conditions mimicking its native high desert habitat, requiring full sun and infrequent, deep watering once established. It prefers well-draining, nutrient-poor soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making overwatering its primary threat. Minimal to no fertilization is necessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in lean, well-draining soils. Fertilizer is generally not needed; if growth is very poor, use a very dilute, balanced formula once in spring.
