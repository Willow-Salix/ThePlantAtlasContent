## 🌱 Overview
The Circaea, or enchanter's nightshades, are a genus of flowering plants in the evening primrose family Onagraceae. About two dozen taxa have been described, including eight species. Plants of the genus occur throughout the temperate and boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere. Three taxa occur in North America: Circaea alpina, Circaea canadensis, and the hybrid Circaea × sterilis. The generic name Circaea refers to the enchantress Circe from Greek mythology who is said to have used the herb as a charm.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Broadleaf Enchanter's Nightshade thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions, mimicking its native temperate woodland understory. Ensure consistently moist, nutrient-rich soil with good drainage, and protect it from strong, direct sun. Minimal fertilization is required if grown in adequate soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers moderately rich to rich, humic soils. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil quality is poor.
