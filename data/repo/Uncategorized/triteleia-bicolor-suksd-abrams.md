## 🌱 Overview
Triteleia is a genus of monocotyledon flowering plants also known as triplet lilies. The 16 species are native to western North America, from British Columbia south to California and east to Wyoming and Arizona, with one species in northwestern Mexico. However, they are most common in California. They are perennial plants growing from a fibrous corm roughly spherical in shape. They get their name from the fact that all parts of their flowers come in threes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives with a distinct wet-dry cycle, mirroring its native climate. Provide ample water during its active growth in late winter and spring, followed by a dry dormancy in summer. Plant in full sun to partial shade in well-draining soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring as new growth emerges is generally sufficient, or may not be needed in rich soils.
