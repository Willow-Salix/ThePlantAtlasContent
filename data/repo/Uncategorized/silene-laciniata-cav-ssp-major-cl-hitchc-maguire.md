| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland and Arid Foothills |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for optimal flowering, especially in cooler climates, tolerating some afternoon shade in very hot regions. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant. Water moderately during its active growing season (typically cooler months), allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires very little water once established, especially during summer dormancy. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Cardinal Catchfly thrives in sunny, well-draining conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean scrubland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring moderate water during cooler growing periods and minimal water when dormant. Fertilization is generally light and infrequent.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in nutrient-poor, well-draining soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring may be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary.
