## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mourning Milkvetch thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its arid montane native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and has low fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Avoid overwatering to ensure plant health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization. A very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly if planted in extremely poor soil, but is often not necessary.
