## 🌱 Overview
Papyrus ( pə-PY-rəs) is a material similar to thick paper that was used in ancient times as a writing material. It was made from the pith of the papyrus plant, Cyperus papyrus, a wetland sedge. Papyrus (plural: papyri or papyruses) can also refer to a document written on sheets of such material, joined side by side and rolled up into a scroll, an early form of a book.

Papyrus was first known to have been used in Egypt (at least as far back as the First Dynasty), as the papyrus plant was once abundant across the Nile Delta. It was also used throughout the Mediterranean region. Apart from writing material, ancient Egyptians employed papyrus in the construction of other artifacts, such as reed boats, mats, rope, sandals, and baskets.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Papyrus thrives in full sun with continuously wet to submerged roots, replicating its native tropical wetland conditions. It benefits from moderate to regular fertilization to support its rapid growth, and must be protected from frost.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to heavy feeding, especially during the growing season, due to its vigorous growth in nutrient-rich wetland environments.
