## 🌱 Overview
Dicranum is a genus of mosses, also called wind-blown mosses or fork mosses. 
These mosses form in densely packed clumps. Stems may fork, but do not branch. In general, upright stems will be single but packed together. Dicranum is distributed globally. In North America these are commonly found in Jack pine or Red pine stands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss requires a consistently moist, high-humidity environment with low to moderate indirect light, similar to its native temperate forest floor. Avoid direct sunlight and do not over-fertilize, as it extracts sufficient nutrients from its surroundings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Mosses generally do not require supplemental fertilization. Excessive nutrients can be harmful.
