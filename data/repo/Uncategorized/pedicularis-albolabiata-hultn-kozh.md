## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Subarctic and Arctic regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Yukon, Northwest Territories) and Far East Russia (Siberia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun exposure, mimicking its open, treeless native habitat in the tundra where it receives direct sunlight during long summer days. |
| **💧 Water** | Needs consistently moist soil, particularly during its growing season, reflecting its native environment in bogs, moist tundra, and alpine meadows. Good drainage is crucial to prevent waterlogging and root rot, especially given the potential for frozen ground. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for White-lipped Lousewort, provide full sun exposure and maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, replicating its arctic tundra origins. It is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, so minimal fertilization is required to ensure healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Its native tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor and slow to decompose, so it is adapted to thrive with minimal nutrient input. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
