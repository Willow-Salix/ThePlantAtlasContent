## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas, and Dry Shrublands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), as it naturally occurs in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas without canopy cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to low. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in climates with distinct wet and dry seasons. Allow soil to dry out between waterings, watering more during active growth and reducing frequency during dormant periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Desmanthus is a genus of flowering plants in the mimosoid clade of the subfamily Caesalpinioideae of the pea family, Fabaceae. The name is derived from the Greek words δεσμός (desmos), meaning "bundle", and ἄνθος (anthos), meaning "flower". It contains about 24 species of herbs and shrubs that are sometimes described as being suffruticose and have bipinnate leaves. Desmanthus is closely related to Leucaena and in appearance is similar to Neptunia. Like Mimosa and Neptunia, Desmanthus species fold their leaves in the evening. They are native to Mexico and North, Central and South America.  Members of the genus are commonly known as bundleflowers.  Donkey beans is another common name and originated in Central America, where Desmanthus species are highly regarded as fodder for these domestic draught animals.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native open, often dry habitats. It requires moderate to low watering, being tolerant of dry periods, and has minimal fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Mimic its native wet and dry seasons for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. It can tolerate poor to moderately fertile soils. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth is weak, but often isn't necessary.
