## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Africa (Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Savanna and Subtropical Dry Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth and flowering, can tolerate partial shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the active growing season, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring less water in dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bauhinia () is a large genus of flowering plants in the subfamily Cercidoideae and tribe Bauhinieae, in the large flowering plant family Fabaceae, with a pantropical distribution. The genus was named after the Bauhin brothers Gaspard and Johann, Swiss-French botanists.
Many species are widely planted in the tropics as orchid trees, particularly in India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Nepal and south-eastern China. Other common names include mountain ebony and kachnar.  Before the family was reorganised, a number of genera including the lianas of genus Phanera were placed here (see related genera).
In the United States, the trees grow in Hawaii, coastal California, Arizona, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. There are native species, like Bauhinia lunarioides native to Texas and widely planted in the Southwest as a landscape plant.
Parts of some species of bauhinia like B. purpurea and B. malabarica are used in Filipino cuisine (known collectively as alinbánban or alinbángbang, "butterfly").
Bauhinia × blakeana is the floral emblem of Hong Kong—a stylized orchid tree flower appears on the flag of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Airlines (formerly CR Airways) uses 'Bauhinia' as its radio callsign in air traffic communication.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Bauhinia thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Southern African savanna environment. It needs moderate water during active growth but is drought-tolerant once established, with light fertilization being sufficient. Allow the soil to dry between waterings, especially outside of its peak growing period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season. As a legume, it naturally fixes nitrogen.
