## 🌱 Overview
Jacobaea aquatica or Senecio aquaticus, the water ragwort or marsh ragwort, is a plant of the family Asteraceae.  It is a perennial or biennial plant: young plants form a rosette near the ground, eventually producing a taller flowering shoot with many bright yellow flower heads, each with prominent ray florets.  It grows in damp, grazed grassland, especially where there has been some disturbance.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently wet, even waterlogged, soil conditions, reflective of its marshland origins. Provide regular watering to prevent drying out and offer light to moderate fertilizer during active growth to support its development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from light to moderate fertilization during the growing season, as wetland soils can vary in nutrient richness.
