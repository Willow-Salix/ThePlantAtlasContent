## 🧤 Care Instructions
Western cowbane thrives in consistently wet, even saturated, soil conditions, mimicking its native wetland habitats. It requires full to partial sun exposure and, like many bog plants, prefers nutrient-poor or low-to-moderately fertilized soil to flourish.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor wetland soils.
