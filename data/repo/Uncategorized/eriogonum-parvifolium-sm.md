## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal regions of California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate / Coastal Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), thriving in open, exposed environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely drought-tolerant once established; requires very little water. Water sparingly during winter/spring if rainfall is insufficient, but avoid waterlogging and minimize summer watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Seacliff Buckwheat thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native coastal scrubland habitat. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, needing minimal watering, especially during dry summer months. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization as it prefers lean conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Thrives in poor, well-draining, often sandy or rocky soils; high fertility can reduce vigor.
