# Chaparral Bush Monkeyflower
### *Diplacus linearis (Benth.) Greene*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (specifically South Coast Ranges, San Joaquin Valley, and Sierra Nevada foothills) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland / Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in full sun, which is typical of its open chaparral habitat, ensuring robust growth and abundant flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry Mediterranean summers. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings; avoid overwatering, especially in summer. |

## 🌱 Overview
Diplacus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. It includes 49 species native to the western United States and northwestern Mexico. Most prefer dry and rocky areas.
The genus Diplacus was first described by Thomas Nuttall in 1838. It was merged into Mimulus no later than 1905, until the 2012 restructuring. The 2012 restructuring of Mimulus by Barker, et al., based largely upon DNA evidence, left seven species in Mimulus, placed 111 into Erythranthe (species with axile placentation and long pedicels), placed 46 into Diplacus (species with parietal placentation and sessile flowers), placed two in Uvedalia, and placed one each in Elacholoma, Mimetanthe, and Thyridia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions, mimicking its native California chaparral habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and very little to no fertilizer. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot and promote healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. Native chaparral soils are typically lean, so rich soils or excessive fertilization can be detrimental, leading to leggy growth and reduced flowering. If necessary, a very light, slow-release native plant formula can be applied in late fall or early spring.
