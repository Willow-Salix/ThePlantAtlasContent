## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fern thrives in cool, humid conditions with consistent moisture and low light, mimicking its native forest floor environment. Provide well-draining, organically rich soil and protect it from direct sun to ensure lush growth. Fertilize sparingly, preferring organic amendments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization. Benefits from a weak, balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring/early summer) or an annual application of compost/leaf mold to enrich the soil.
