## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Mexico, Central America, and Northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Peru) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest and Subtropical Savanna |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (minimum 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for vigorous growth and abundant fruit production, reflecting its open-field native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent and deep watering, especially during flowering and fruiting periods. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings to mimic natural rainfall patterns and prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Butternut squash (a variety of Cucurbita moschata), known in Australia and New Zealand as butternut pumpkin or gramma, is a type of winter squash that grows on a vine. It has a sweet, nutty taste similar to that of a pumpkin. It has tan-yellow skin and orange fleshy pulp with a compartment of seeds in the blossom end. When ripening, the flesh turns increasingly deep orange due to its rich content of beta-carotene, a provitamin A compound.
Although botanically a fruit (specifically, a berry), butternut squash is used culinarily as a vegetable that can be roasted, sautéed, puréed for soups such as squash soup, or mashed to be used in casseroles, breads, muffins, and pies. It is part of the same squash family as ponca, waltham, pumpkin, and calabaza.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cultivate Butternut Squash in a location receiving full sun and in rich, well-draining soil. Provide consistent, deep watering, allowing slight drying between sessions, and fertilize regularly to support its heavy feeding nature for optimal fruit development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Heavy feeder; thrives in fertile, well-draining soil rich in organic matter. Benefit from regular applications of a balanced organic fertilizer or compost throughout the growing season, particularly once flowers and fruits begin to form.
