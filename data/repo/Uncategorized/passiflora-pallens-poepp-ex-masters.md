## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light, similar to its native tropical forest understory. Ensure consistently moist, well-drained soil and provide regular fertilization during the growing season to support its vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding during the active growing season (spring through summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, as tropical forest soils can be rich but also prone to nutrient leaching.
