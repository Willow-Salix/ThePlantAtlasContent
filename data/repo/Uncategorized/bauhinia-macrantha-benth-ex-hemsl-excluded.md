## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern China (Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan, Yunnan provinces) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Monsoon Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. While it can tolerate morning sun, it should be protected from harsh afternoon sun, consistent with its growth as a climbing plant or shrub in forest edges or clearings. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture during the active growing season (spring and summer), allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. Significantly reduce watering frequency in winter, permitting the soil to dry out more to simulate its native drier dormant period. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bauhinia () is a large genus of flowering plants in the subfamily Cercidoideae and tribe Bauhinieae, in the large flowering plant family Fabaceae, with a pantropical distribution. The genus was named after the Bauhin brothers Gaspard and Johann, Swiss-French botanists.
Many species are widely planted in the tropics as orchid trees, particularly in India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Nepal and south-eastern China. Other common names include mountain ebony and kachnar.  Before the family was reorganised, a number of genera including the lianas of genus Phanera were placed here (see related genera).
In the United States, the trees grow in Hawaii, coastal California, Arizona, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. There are native species, like Bauhinia lunarioides native to Texas and widely planted in the Southwest as a landscape plant.
Parts of some species of bauhinia like B. purpurea and B. malabarica are used in Filipino cuisine (known collectively as alinbánban or alinbángbang, "butterfly").
Bauhinia × blakeana is the floral emblem of Hong Kong—a stylized orchid tree flower appears on the flag of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Airlines (formerly CR Airways) uses 'Bauhinia' as its radio callsign in air traffic communication.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in warm, humid environments, preferring bright indirect light. During its active growth, maintain consistent soil moisture and provide regular fertilization, mimicking its native subtropical monsoon climate. Reduce watering and cease fertilization in winter to support its natural dormant phase, and protect it from cold temperatures.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring through late summer). Fertilization should be reduced or stopped entirely during the dormant winter months.
