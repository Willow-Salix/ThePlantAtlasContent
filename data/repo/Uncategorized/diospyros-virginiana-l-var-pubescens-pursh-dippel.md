| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest/Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, ideally requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and fruit production. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during its establishment phase; becomes highly drought-tolerant once mature. Prefers consistent moisture in well-drained soil but can withstand drier periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Diospyros virginiana is a persimmon species commonly called the American persimmon, common persimmon, eastern persimmon, simmon, possumwood, possum apples,  or sugar plum. It ranges from southern Connecticut to Florida, and  west to Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa. The tree grows in the wild but has been cultivated for its fruit and wood since prehistoric times by Native Americans. Both the tree and the fruit are referred to as persimmons, with the latter appearing in desserts and cuisine in the U.S. South and Midwest.
The tree is typically dioecious, so one must have both male and female plants to obtain fruit.
Commercial varieties include the very productive Early Golden, the productive John Rick, Miller, Woolbright and the Ennis, a seedless variety. Another nickname of the American persimmon, 'date-plum' also refers to a persimmon species found in South Asia and South Europe, Diospyros lotus. Today, persimmons are also grown on small farms as a heritage crop.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The American Persimmon thrives in temperate climates, preferring full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Young plants require moderate watering, but mature trees are notably drought-tolerant and adaptable. Minimal fertilization is typically sufficient, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder, but an annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can benefit growth and fruit yield, especially in poorer soils.
