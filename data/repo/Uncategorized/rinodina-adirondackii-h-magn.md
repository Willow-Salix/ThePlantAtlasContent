| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Adirondack Mountains, Eastern North America (USA, Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest (on exposed rocky outcrops) |
| **☀️ Light** | Moderate to High Sun Exposure (prefers open, well-lit rock surfaces) |

## 🌱 Overview
Rinodina is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 265 species. It is hypothesized that a few saxicolous species common to dry regions of western North America, southern Europe, North Africa and central Asia may date back 240 million years to the Middle Triassic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool temperate climates on exposed, non-calcareous rock surfaces, requiring moderate to high sun. It absorbs moisture from consistent rainfall and humidity, but does not need watering or fertilization, as artificial nutrients are detrimental to its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None; lichens obtain nutrients from air and rain; sensitive to introduced fertilizers.
