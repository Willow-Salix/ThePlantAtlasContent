## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wetland plant thrives in consistently wet to submerged conditions under full to partial sun, typical of its native marsh and riparian zones. Ensure constant moisture for the roots and provide moderate nutrients for optimal growth. It is best suited for water gardens, boggy areas, or pond margins.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a slow-release aquatic plant fertilizer if container-grown; otherwise, naturally fertile wetland sediments are usually sufficient.
