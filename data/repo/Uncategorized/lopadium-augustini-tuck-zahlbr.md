| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States, Caribbean |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in highly humid environments with indirect light, mimicking its native subtropical forest habitat. It requires consistent moisture through high ambient humidity and regular exposure to water, while having minimal nutrient needs, making fertilizers generally unnecessary and potentially harmful.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Lichens absorb nutrients directly from the air, rainfall, and the substrate they grow on. Excess nutrients, especially from synthetic fertilizers, can be detrimental.
