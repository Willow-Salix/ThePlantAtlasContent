# White-margined Rockcress
### *Leucocraspedum albomarginatum (S. Watson) Rydb.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Oregon) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-Arid Montane Woodlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. Tolerates partial sun but may have reduced flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, especially in cooler months, to prevent root rot. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, dry conditions with excellent drainage, replicating its native semi-arid mountain environment. Provide full sun exposure and water sparingly, ensuring the soil dries completely between waterings to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. If necessary, a light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring is sufficient.
