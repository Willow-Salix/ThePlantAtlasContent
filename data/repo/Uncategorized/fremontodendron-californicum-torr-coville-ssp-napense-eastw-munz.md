## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Napa Flannelbush, provide full sun exposure and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal infrequent watering. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it thrives in lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Native chaparral soils are typically lean, and this plant does not tolerate rich or heavily fertilized conditions, which can lead to excessive, weak growth.
