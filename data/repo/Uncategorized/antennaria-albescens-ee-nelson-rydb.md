## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (specifically the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Montane |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in high light exposure typical of mountain elevations. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Tolerant of drought once established, adapting to native rainfall and snowmelt patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Antennaria albescens thrives in full to partial sun with well-drained, rocky or gravelly soil, mimicking its native alpine habitat. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and avoid rich fertilization. This plant is adapted to harsh, lean conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; prefers lean, nutrient-poor soils and does not require rich fertilization.
