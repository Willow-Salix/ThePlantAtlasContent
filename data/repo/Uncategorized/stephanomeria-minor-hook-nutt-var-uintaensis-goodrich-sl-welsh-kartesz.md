| **🌍 Origin** | Uinta Basin, Utah and southwestern Wyoming, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-Arid Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) to mimic its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water sparingly and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Uinta Wirelettuce thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soil, replicating its native arid scrubland environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering once the soil is completely dry, and has minimal to no fertilization needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs; typically thrives in lean, poor soils. If desired, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once during the growing season.
