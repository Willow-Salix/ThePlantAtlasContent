## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in cool, highly moist, and shaded environments, mimicking its natural habitat on damp rocks or near water bodies. It requires consistent humidity and should never be allowed to dry out completely. Fertilization is generally not needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses are not heavy feeders and typically obtain sufficient nutrients from water and the substrate. Excessive fertilizer can be detrimental.
