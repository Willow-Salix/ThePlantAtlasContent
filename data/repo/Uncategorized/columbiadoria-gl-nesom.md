## 🧤 Care Instructions
Columbiadoria thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, mimicking its native temperate woodland habitat. It requires moderate watering, with the soil allowed to dry out between applications, and exhibits good drought tolerance once established. Minimal fertilization is typically needed for this resilient native wildflower.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a native plant thriving in woodland and clearing conditions, it is likely not a heavy feeder. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring should be sufficient, or it may not require any additional fertilizer if planted in naturally rich soil.
