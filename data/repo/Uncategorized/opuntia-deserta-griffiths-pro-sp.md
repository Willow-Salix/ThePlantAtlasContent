| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern California, USA and Baja California, Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun; requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, replicating its open desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to root rot if overwatered. |

## 🌱 Overview
Opuntia, commonly called the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family Cactaceae, many known for their flavorful fruit and showy flowers. Cacti are native to the Americas, and are well adapted to arid climates; however, they are still vulnerable to alterations in precipitation and temperature driven by climate change. The plant has been introduced to Australia, southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.
Prickly pear alone is also used to refer to the fruit, but may also be used for the plant itself; in addition, other names given to the plant and its specific parts include tuna (fruit), sabra, sabbar, nopal (pads, plural nopales, from the Nahuatl word nōpalli), nostle (fruit) from the Nahuatl word nōchtli, and paddle cactus. The genus is named for the Ancient Greek city of Opus. The fruit and leaves are edible. The most common culinary species is the "Barbary fig" (Opuntia ficus-indica).
In places where they have been introduced outside their native range, some species in the genus Opuntia behave as aggressive invasive species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert hybrid thrives in full sun, needing extensive direct light. It requires very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to completely dry between sessions to prevent rot. Fertilize minimally with a specialized cactus formula during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; fertilize sparingly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a low-nitrogen cactus-specific fertilizer, reflecting the nutrient-poor desert soils.
