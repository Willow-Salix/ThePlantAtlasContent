## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern Hemisphere (widespread in regions of North America and Europe) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate and Boreal Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light; thrives in shaded, often densely canopied forest understories, so direct sun should be avoided. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity is crucial. Maintain consistent moisture on the substrate (e.g., decaying wood) or through frequent misting, as lichens absorb water directly from the environment. Avoid prolonged periods of complete dryness. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chaenotheca is a genus of lichenized fungi within the family Coniocybaceae. The sexual reproduction structures are a mass of loose ascospores that are enclosed by a cup shaped exciple sitting on top of a tiny stalk, having the appearance of a dressmaker's pin (called a mazaedium), hence the common name pin lichen. Genus members are also commonly called needle lichens. Photobiont partners for Chaenotheca include members of the algae genera Symbiochloris, Trebouxia, Trentepohlia, and Tritostichococcus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, highly humid environments with very low to indirect light, mimicking its native forest understory habitat. Ensure consistent moisture through high ambient humidity or misting, as direct watering is not applicable. Avoid any direct sun exposure or fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not required; external fertilizers can be detrimental as lichens derive nutrients from the air, rain, and their substrate.
