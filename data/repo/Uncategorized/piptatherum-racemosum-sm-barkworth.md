## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate grass thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil, tolerating dry conditions well once established. It needs moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs, making it a robust and relatively low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to less fertile soils, a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer application once in spring is typically sufficient, or only if growth seems poor.
