## 🧤 Care Instructions
Nuttall's Groundsmoke prefers full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and apply fertilizer sparingly, especially during its active growth period. This care regimen closely mirrors its native temperate montane and scrubland environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in varying, sometimes disturbed soils, so heavy fertilization is not typically needed but a light feed during the growing season can be beneficial.
