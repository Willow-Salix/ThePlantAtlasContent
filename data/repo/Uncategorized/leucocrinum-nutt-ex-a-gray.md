## 🧤 Care Instructions
Starlily thrives in full sun to partial shade with excellent drainage, mimicking its native semi-arid environment. Provide moderate water during its spring growth, then allow for dry conditions during its summer dormancy. Fertilization needs are minimal, suitable for low-nutrient soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be beneficial in early spring, but it generally thrives without heavy feeding in appropriate soil conditions.
