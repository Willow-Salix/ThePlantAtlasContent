## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Common Buttonbush thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, favoring full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native wetland habitats. It demands ample water and is relatively undemanding regarding soil fertility, making it a low-maintenance choice for areas with persistent moisture.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average soil and typically does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth appears weak.
