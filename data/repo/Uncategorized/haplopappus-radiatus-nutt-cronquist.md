## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient prairie plant thrives in full sun and requires moderate, consistent watering, though it is quite tolerant of drier periods once established. It is adapted to average soil fertility and does not necessitate heavy fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for sunny, open areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich soil.
