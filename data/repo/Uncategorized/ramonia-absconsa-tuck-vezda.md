| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America, Pacific Northwest (USA, Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Humid Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Low light to dappled shade; avoid direct sun exposure, preferring the dim conditions of a forest understory. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ramonia is a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Gyalectaceae. It contains 24 species. The genus was circumscribed by Ernst Stizenberger in 1862.
The genus name of Ramonia is in honour of Ramón Dionisio José de la Sagra (1798–1871), who was a Spanish anarchist, politician, writer, and botanist who founded the world's first anarchist journal, El Porvenir (Spanish for "The Future").

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen thrives in very high humidity and extremely low, indirect light conditions, mirroring its native temperate forest habitat. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture and a stable, unfertilized substrate, making it best suited for a controlled, humid environment like a terrarium.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not required; as a lichen, it obtains necessary nutrients from the air, rain, and its substrate, and conventional fertilizers can be detrimental.
