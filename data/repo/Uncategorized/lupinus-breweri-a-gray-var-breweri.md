## 🧤 Care Instructions
Brewer's Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its high-altitude Sierra Nevada origins. It requires moderate watering, preferring to dry out between waterings and tolerating drought once established, while needing little to no supplemental fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, as it's a nitrogen-fixing legume. Avoid nitrogen-rich fertilizers.
