## 🌱 Overview
Campanula () is the type genus of the Campanulaceae family of flowering plants. Campanula are commonly known as bellflowers and take both their common and scientific names from the bell-shaped flowers—campanula is Latin for "little bell".
The genus includes over 500 species and several subspecies, distributed across the temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with centers of diversity in the Mediterranean region, Balkans, Caucasus and mountains of western Asia. The range also extends into mountains in tropical regions of Asia and Africa.

The species include annual, biennial and perennial plants, and vary in habit from dwarf arctic and alpine species under 5 cm high, to large temperate grassland and woodland species growing to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Carnic Bellflower thrives in conditions reflecting its alpine origins, requiring full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It prefers lean to moderately fertile soil, benefiting from minimal fertilization, especially during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs; adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky alpine soils. A balanced, slow-release formula can be applied sparingly.
