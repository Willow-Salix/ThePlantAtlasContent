## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Evening Rainlily flourishes in full sun and exceptionally well-drained soil, mimicking its native arid to semi-arid grassland environment. Water sparingly during its dormant periods and moderately during active growth, ensuring the soil dries completely between waterings. Fertilize lightly to encourage its characteristic post-rain blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in early spring, or a diluted liquid feed every few weeks during the active growing season, is sufficient.
