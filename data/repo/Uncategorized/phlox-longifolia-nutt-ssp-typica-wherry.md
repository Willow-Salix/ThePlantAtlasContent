## 🧤 Care Instructions
Longleaf Phlox thrives in conditions mimicking its native Western North American semi-arid grasslands. It requires full sun and well-drained soil, tolerating drought once established with infrequent watering. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to leaner soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soils; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or none at all if soil is naturally fertile.
