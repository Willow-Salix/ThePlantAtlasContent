## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar Northern Hemisphere, including mountainous regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane, Boreal, and Alpine Tundra. |
| **☀️ Light** | High to full sun exposure, mimicking their open and exposed native habitats on rocks or tree bark. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and occasional moisture (rain, dew, misting), but good air circulation is crucial to allow for drying periods between hydration. Avoid prolonged saturation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Carbonea is a genus of fungi in the  family Lecanoraceae. Most of the species grow on lichens. The genus is widespread, and contains 20 species. Carbonea was originally circumscribed as a subgenus of Lecidea in 1967 before it was promoted to generic status in 1983.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, exposed environments with high light and atmospheric moisture. Provide bright conditions and ensure good air circulation, allowing periods of drying between mistings. Avoid traditional fertilization, as they obtain nutrients from their surroundings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required. Lichens derive nutrients from the atmosphere and substrate; they are sensitive to nutrient excess.
