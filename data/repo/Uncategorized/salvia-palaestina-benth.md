| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate transitioning to Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Palestine Sage thrives in full sun and well-draining, even poor, soil, reflecting its origins in open, rocky Mediterranean and arid scrubland environments. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, with caution against overwatering. Minimal fertilization is needed to maintain its robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soil. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary.
