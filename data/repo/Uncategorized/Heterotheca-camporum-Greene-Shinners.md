## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, mimicking its native prairie environment. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering, and benefits from minimal fertilization to maintain its robust form.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; native to average to poor soils, so over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth. A light, balanced fertilizer once in spring is sufficient if growth appears weak.
