## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Olympic Mountains, Washington, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine Meadows and Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; requires high light exposure characteristic of exposed mountain meadows. |
| **💧 Water** | High watering frequency; keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage, mimicking conditions of melting snow and frequent rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Epilobium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae, containing about 197 species. The genus has a worldwide distribution. It is most prevalent in the subarctic, temperate and subantarctic regions, whereas in the subtropics and tropics Epilobium species are restricted to the cool montane biomes, such as the New Guinea Highlands.
The taxonomy of the genus has varied between different botanists, but the modern trend is to include the previously recognised genera Boisduvalia, Chamaenerion (previously Chamerion), Pyrogennema and Zauschneria within Epilobium according to Peter H. Raven, who has extensively studied the willowherbs and merges the other segregate genera into Epilobium. Fringed willowherb (Epilobium ciliatum) is likely a cryptic species complex; apparently these plants also commonly hybridize with their congeners.
Most species are known by the common name willowherbs for their willow-like leaves. Those that were once separated in Boisduvalia are called spike-primroses or boisduvalias. Those Epilobium species previously placed in the Chamaenerion group are known as fireweeds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in cool, bright conditions with consistently moist, well-drained soil, typical of its native subalpine and alpine meadows. Provide ample sunlight and avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to lean mountain soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization, especially with high nitrogen, should be avoided.
