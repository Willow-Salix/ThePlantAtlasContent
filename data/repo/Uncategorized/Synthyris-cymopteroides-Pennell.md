## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine native thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring bright, cool conditions, and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil during its active growth. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to lean, montane soils and excess nutrients can be detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding or no fertilizer needed; adapted to lean, well-draining soils.
