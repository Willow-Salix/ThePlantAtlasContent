## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (southern Sierra Nevada and Transverse Ranges) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Mediterranean Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **💧 Water** | Low; drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in well-draining conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Whitefelt Indian Paintbrush thrives in full sun and very lean, well-draining soils, mimicking its arid native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering. As a hemiparasitic plant, it relies on host plants for nutrients and water, meaning supplemental fertilizer is rarely needed and can be detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. Supplemental fertilization is generally not needed and can be harmful due to its hemiparasitic nature.
