| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Fynbos/Renosterveld), specifically in seasonally wet areas, moist depressions, or marshy fringes. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Native habitats are typically open, receiving high sun exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | High during active growth (winter to spring), requiring consistently moist to wet soil. Tolerate drier conditions during summer dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Triglochin is a plant genus in the family Juncaginaceae described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It includes 25 known species. It is very nearly cosmopolitan in distribution, with species on every continent except Antarctica. North America has four accepted species, two of which can also be found in Europe: Triglochin palustris (marsh arrowgrass) and Triglochin maritima (sea arrowgrass). Australia has many more.
The most widely used common name for the genus is arrowgrass, although these plants are not really grasses. Many of the common names for species make use of the term "arrowgrass", although there are exceptions: T. procera, for example, is commonly known as water ribbons.
Arrowgrasses are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the grey chi moth.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide full sun and consistently moist to wet soil during its active growing season from winter through spring. Allow for a drier period during its summer dormancy. Fertilize very sparingly, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Native soils are often nutrient-poor. Apply a very diluted, balanced fertilizer sparingly if growth is weak during active periods.
