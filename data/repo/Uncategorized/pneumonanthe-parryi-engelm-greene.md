## 🌱 Overview
Gentiana () is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the gentian family (Gentianaceae), the tribe Gentianeae, and the monophyletic subtribe Gentianinae. With over 300 species, it is considered a large genus. Gentians are notable for their mostly large trumpet-shaped flowers, which are often of an intense blue hue, though some are also bright yellow. The type species of the genus is Gentiana lutea.
The genus name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king who may have discovered tonic properties in gentians.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Parry's Gentian thrives in conditions mimicking its Rocky Mountain native habitat. Provide full to partial sun, ensuring consistent soil moisture with excellent drainage. Fertilize lightly in spring for optimal growth.
