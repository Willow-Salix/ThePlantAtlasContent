## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine clubmoss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and well-drained acidic soil, mirroring its high-altitude native habitat. It prefers bright indirect light to partial sun, avoiding harsh direct sun. Fertilize sparingly to mimic nutrient-poor alpine conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal. Light fertilization with a dilute liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season; alpine soils are typically nutrient-poor.
