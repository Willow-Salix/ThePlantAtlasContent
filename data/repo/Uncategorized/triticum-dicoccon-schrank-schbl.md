# Emmer Wheat
### *Triticum dicoccon (Schrank) SchÃ¼bl.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Near East (Fertile Crescent), including regions of modern-day Syria, Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Turkey, and Iran. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean to Semi-Arid |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for optimal growth and grain production, reflecting its origin as an open-field crop. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth (fall through spring) is required, mimicking the wet winters of its native climate. It can tolerate drier conditions once established, particularly as grains ripen in late spring/early summer. |

## 🌱 Overview
Wheat is a group of wild and domesticated grasses of the genus Triticum (). They are cultivated for their cereal grains, which are staple foods around the world. Well-known wheat species and hybrids include the most widely grown common wheat (T. aestivum), spelt, durum, emmer, einkorn, and Khorasan or Kamut. The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BC.
Wheat is grown on a larger area of land than any other food crop (220.7 million hectares or 545 million acres in 2021). World trade in wheat is greater than that of all other crops combined. In 2021, world wheat production was 771 million tonnes (850 million short tons), making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (known as corn in North America and Australia; wheat is often called corn in other countries including Britain). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century. Global demand for wheat is increasing because of the usefulness of gluten to the food industry.
Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates. Globally, it is the leading source of vegetable proteins in human food, having a protein content of about 13%, which is relatively high compared to other major cereals but relatively low in protein quality (supplying essential amino acids). When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fibre. In a small part of the general population, gluten – which comprises most of the protein in wheat – can trigger coeliac disease, noncoeliac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia, and dermatitis herpetiformis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Emmer wheat thrives in full sun conditions, much like its origins in the open fields of the Near East. It requires moderate watering, particularly during its active growth phases in cooler months, and benefits from fertile soil to support robust grain production. Provide ample space and well-draining soil for best results.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a grain crop, Emmer wheat benefits from nutrient-rich soil. Regular fertilization, especially with nitrogen during vegetative growth and phosphorus/potassium for grain development, is beneficial.
