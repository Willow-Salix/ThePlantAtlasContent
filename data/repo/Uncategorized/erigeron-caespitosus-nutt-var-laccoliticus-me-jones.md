## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in bright, full sun conditions, mimicking its native arid western North American habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established, needing well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum as it's adapted to poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, or with a very weak solution once a year in spring if growth appears sluggish.
