## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America (mountainous regions where parent species, Woodsia ilvensis and Woodsia scopulina, overlap, primarily the Rocky Mountains and northern parts of the continent) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Montane/Subalpine |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to full sun in cooler climates; prefers partial shade in warmer regions to avoid scorching. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage. Allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot, as it naturally grows in rocky, well-drained crevices. |

## 🌱 Overview
Woodsia is a genus of ferns in the family Woodsiaceae. Species of Woodsia are commonly known as cliff ferns. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), it was the only genus in the family Woodsiaceae. In 2020, Physematium was split off from Woodsia on the basis of molecular phylogenetic evidence. As of June 2023, Plants of the World Online continued to treat Physematium as a synonym of Woodsia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tryon's Woodsia is a hardy rock fern adapted to cool, well-drained, rocky environments. Provide partial shade, especially in warmer areas, and maintain consistent soil moisture while ensuring excellent drainage. Fertilize sparingly, if at all.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Apply a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (1-2 times per growing season) only if growth appears sluggish, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor rocky soils.
