## 🌱 Overview
Ipomoea () is the largest genus in the plant family Convolvulaceae, with over 600 species. It is a large and diverse group, with common names including morning glory, water convolvulus or water spinach, sweet potato, bindweed, moonflower, etc. The genus occurs throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and comprises annual and perennial herbaceous plants, lianas, shrubs, and small trees; most of the species are twining climbing plants.
Their most widespread common name is morning glory, but some species in related genera bear that same common name and some Ipomoea species are known by different common names. Those formerly separated in Calonyction (Greek καλός kalós "good" and νύξ, νυκτός núx, nuktós, "night") are called moonflowers. The name Ipomoea is derived from the Ancient Greek ἴψ, meaning 'woodworm', and ὅμοιος (hómoios), meaning "resembling". It refers to their twining habit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Meyer's morning-glory thrives in tropical and subtropical conditions, requiring ample sunlight for abundant blooms. Provide moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and offer light fertilization during its active growth period. This vining plant is relatively low-maintenance, preferring well-draining soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season can promote vigorous growth and flowering, but avoid excessive nitrogen which can lead to more foliage than flowers.
