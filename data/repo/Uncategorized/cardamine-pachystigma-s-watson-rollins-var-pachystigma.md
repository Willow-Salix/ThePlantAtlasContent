## 🧤 Care Instructions
Serpentine Bittercress prefers full sun to partial shade and thrives in well-drained, lean soils typical of its serpentine habitat. Provide regular water during its active growth in cooler months, reducing frequency in summer, and avoid high-nutrient fertilizers as it is sensitive to rich soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor serpentine soils, and high nutrient levels can be detrimental.
