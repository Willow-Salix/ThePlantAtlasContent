## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions across Europe, North America, and parts of Asia, often found in old-growth forests and sheltered ravines. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (moist, shaded understory) |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low light; prefers deep shade with indirect or filtered light, avoiding any direct sun exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity is crucial. Requires frequent misting or placement in a highly humid environment to keep the thallus moist; allow periods of slight drying between moistening but avoid prolonged desiccation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Collema (jelly lichen) is a genus of lichens in the family Collemataceae. The photobiont is the cyanobacterium genus Nostoc. Species in this genus typically grow on nutrient-rich bark or somewhat siliceous or calcareous rocks in humid environments.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Occult Jelly Lichen thrives in consistently moist, deeply shaded conditions found in temperate forests. It requires high ambient humidity and frequent misting to maintain hydration, with brief periods of drying beneficial to prevent rot. No traditional fertilization is necessary, as it is a symbiotic organism that acquires nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; as a lichen, it obtains nutrients from the air, rainfall, and its substrate. Its cyanobacterial component fixes nitrogen.
