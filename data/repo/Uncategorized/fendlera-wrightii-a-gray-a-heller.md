| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Texas) and Northern Mexico (Chihuahua, Sonora) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-Arid Desert Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open, exposed native habitat on rocky slopes and dry washes. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established, mirroring its arid native climate. Requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid excessive watering, especially in cooler months. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wright's fendlerbush thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, reflecting its native arid scrubland habitat in the American Southwest. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. This plant is best suited for xeriscaping or native plant gardens where it can mimic its natural, dry environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Native soils in arid scrublands are typically lean. If growth is poor, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial, but it generally thrives in nutrient-poor conditions.
