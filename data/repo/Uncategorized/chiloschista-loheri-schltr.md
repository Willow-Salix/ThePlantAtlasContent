## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Philippines |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light. As an epiphyte in its native habitat, it grows under the canopy, receiving dappled sunlight. Direct harsh sun will scorch its photosynthetic roots. |
| **💧 Water** | Frequent watering is essential, allowing the leafless roots to dry out briefly between waterings. High humidity (70-85%) is critical and can be maintained through misting, humidity trays, or a humid growing environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chiloschista, commonly known as starfish orchids and abbreviated Chsch., is a genus of usually leafless, epiphytic or lithophytic orchids found in India, Southeast Asia and Australia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Loher's Chiloschista thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light, mimicking its native tropical rainforest environment. Provide frequent watering to its exposed roots, allowing them to dry slightly, and ensure consistently high humidity. Fertilize lightly during active growth to support its unique leafless form.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during active growth. Use a diluted, balanced orchid-specific fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) every 1-2 weeks, flushing with plain water periodically to prevent salt buildup.
