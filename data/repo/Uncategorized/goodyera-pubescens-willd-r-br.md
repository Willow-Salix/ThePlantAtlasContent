## 🌱 Overview
Goodyera, commonly called rattlesnake plantain, jade orchids or ladies' tresses is a wide-ranging genus of orchids in the tribe Cranichideae. About 100 species of Goodyera have been formally described. With a center of diversity in East Asia, Goodyera is found across Europe, Madeira, North and Central America, Australia, and on islands from the west Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. They have a rosette of leaves at their base and usually many small white resupinate flowers. They are similar to orchids in the genus Spiranthes but can be distinguished from them by the shape and colour patterns of the leaves.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This terrestrial orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate forest floor: consistent, dappled indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining, humus-rich soil. Ensure adequate humidity and avoid over-fertilizing to promote healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low feeder. Use a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer (1/4 strength) once a month during the growing season, or incorporate organic matter like leaf mold into the potting mix. Avoid over-fertilizing.
