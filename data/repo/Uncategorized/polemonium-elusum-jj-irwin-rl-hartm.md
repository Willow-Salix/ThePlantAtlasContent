## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Rocky Mountains, Wyoming, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine and Alpine Meadows/Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun in cooler climates or higher elevations, but benefits from some afternoon shade in hotter regions. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil is crucial, mimicking its native habitat along streambanks and moist meadows. Water regularly, especially during dry spells, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Polemonium, commonly called Jacob's ladders or Jacob's-ladders (the name derived from the Biblical story), is a genus of between 25 and 40 species of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae, native to cool temperate to arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. One species, Polemonium micranthum, also occurs in the southern Andes in South America. Many of the species grow at high altitudes, in mountainous areas. Most of the uncertainty in the number of species relates to those in Eurasia, many of which have been synonymized with Polemonium caeruleum.
Polemonium are perennial plants (rarely annual plants) growing 10–120 cm tall with bright green leaves divided into lance-shaped leaflets. They produce blue (rarely white or pink) flowers in the spring and summer.
Some species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora polemoniella.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This high-altitude plant thrives in cool, bright conditions with consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide full sun to partial shade and light fertilization to encourage robust growth and flowering, mimicking its natural subalpine meadow habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in early spring, or incorporating organic compost into the soil, should suffice for healthy growth.
