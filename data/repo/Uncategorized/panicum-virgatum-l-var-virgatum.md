## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Eastern North America, ranging from southern Canada to northern Mexico, and from the Atlantic coast west to the Rocky Mountains. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Tallgrass Prairie |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth, mimicking its open prairie habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Once established, switchgrass is highly drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid consistently wet conditions as it's accustomed to well-drained prairie soils. |

## 🌱 Overview
Panicum virgatum, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial warm season bunchgrass native to North America, where it occurs naturally from 55°N latitude in Canada southwards into the United States and Mexico. Switchgrass is one of the dominant species of the central North American tallgrass prairie and can be found in remnant prairies, in native grass pastures, and naturalized along roadsides. It is used primarily for soil conservation, forage production, game cover, as an ornamental grass, in phytoremediation projects, fiber, electricity, heat production, for biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and more recently as a biomass crop for the production of ethanol and butanol.
Other common names for switchgrass include tall panic grass, Wobsqua grass, blackbent, tall prairiegrass, wild redtop, thatchgrass, and Virginia switchgrass.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Switchgrass is a robust, low-maintenance ornamental grass that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal supplemental watering or fertilization, making it ideal for naturalized plantings and native gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring is optional if growth is weak, but often unnecessary as prairie soils are naturally fertile but not excessively rich for this species.
