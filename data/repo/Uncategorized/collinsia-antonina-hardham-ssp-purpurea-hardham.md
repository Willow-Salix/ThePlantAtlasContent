| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (specifically the inner South Coast Ranges) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (Chaparral, Oak Woodland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers good light during its active growth and flowering period, with some protection from intense afternoon sun in hotter areas. |

## 🌱 Overview
Collinsia is a genus of about 20 species of annual flowering plants, consisting of the blue eyed Marys and the Chinese houses.  It was traditionally placed in the snapdragon family Scrophulariaceae, but following recent research in molecular genetics, it has now been placed in a much enlarged family Plantaginaceae.
The genus is endemic to North America, and is named in honor of Zacchaeus Collins, a Philadelphia botanist of the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century. Many of the 20 species may be found in California.
Two species, Collinsia parviflora (smallflower blue eyed Mary) and Collinsia violacea (violet blue eyed Mary), had medicinal uses among American Indian peoples.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native annual thrives in a Mediterranean climate, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistent moisture during its spring growth and bloom period. It prefers well-draining soil and has low fertilizer needs. Allow the plant to dry out and go dormant during the hot, dry summer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is generally needed. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in early spring can be beneficial, especially in very poor soils.
