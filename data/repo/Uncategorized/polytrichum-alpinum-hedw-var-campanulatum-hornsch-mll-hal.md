## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal and arctic-alpine regions, including high latitudes across North America, Europe, and Asia, as well as high-altitude mountain ranges globally (e.g., Rockies, Alps, Himalayas). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Subalpine, and Boreal Forest biomes. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade is ideal. It can tolerate some direct morning sun, especially if ambient humidity is consistently high, reflecting its exposure in open alpine areas while relying on moisture. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist (but not waterlogged) substrate and high ambient humidity. In its native habitat, it benefits from frequent precipitation, fog, and snowmelt. Regular misting or a closed terrarium environment is beneficial to maintain humidity. |

## 🌱 Overview
Polytrichum is a genus of mosses — commonly called haircap moss or hair moss — which contains approximately 70 species that have a cosmopolitan distribution.
The genus Polytrichum has a number of closely related sporophytic characters. The scientific name is derived from the Ancient Greek words polys, meaning "many", and thrix, meaning "hair". This name was used in ancient times to refer to plants with fine, hairlike parts, including mosses, but this application specifically refers to the hairy calyptras found on young sporophytes. A similar naming related to hair appears in Old Norse, haddr silfjar, "hair of Sif", goddess from Norse Mythology, wife of the god Thor. There are two major sections of Polytrichum species. The first — section Polytrichum — has narrow, toothed, and relatively erect leaf margins. The other — section Juniperifolia — has broad, entire,  and sharply inflexed leaf margins that enclose the lamellae on the upper leaf surface.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and high-humidity environments, mimicking its native habitat. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and ensure the substrate remains damp at all times, never allowing it to dry out. Fertilization is generally not required, as it prefers nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. Mosses are adapted to nutrient-poor environments and excessive nutrients can harm them. If absolutely necessary, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied very sparingly.
