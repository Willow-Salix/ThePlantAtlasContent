## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gunnison milkvetch thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils typical of its arid native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between applications. Fertilization is generally unnecessary due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. If grown in very poor soil, a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring might be considered, but generally not required.
