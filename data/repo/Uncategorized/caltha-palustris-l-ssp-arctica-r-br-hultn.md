## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar arctic and subarctic regions, including northern North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada), Greenland, Northern Europe, and Northern Asia (e.g., Siberia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Subarctic Wetlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, adapting to the long daylight hours of the growing season in its native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently wet to saturated soil conditions, mimicking its marshy native habitat. It can tolerate standing water and should never be allowed to dry out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Caltha is a genus of rhizomatous perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae ("buttercup family"), to which ten species have been assigned. They occur in moist environments in temperate and cold regions of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Their leaves are generally heart-shaped or kidney-shaped, or are characteristically diplophyllous (the auricles of the leaf blades form distinctly inflexed appendages). Flowers are star shaped and mostly yellow to white. True petals and nectaries are missing but the five or more sepals are distinctly colored. As usual in the buttercup family there is a circle of stamens around (two to twenty-five) free carpels.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Arctic Marsh Marigold thrives in consistently wet to saturated soil conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade during its active growth. Mimicking its native boggy, arctic habitat, it requires minimal fertilization and should never be allowed to dry out.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor boggy soils. Use a balanced, slow-release or diluted liquid fertilizer sparingly, if at all.
