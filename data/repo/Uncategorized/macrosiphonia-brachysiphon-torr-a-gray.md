| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico (e.g., Sonora, Chihuahua) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), thriving in open, exposed conditions typical of desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent deep watering; allow the soil to completely dry out between waterings to mimic desert rainfall patterns and prevent root rot. It is highly drought-tolerant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eriogonum inflatum, the desert trumpet, is a perennial plant of the family Polygonaceae. The plant possesses very small yellow or pink flowers and an inflated stem just below branching segments.  Eriogonum: from the Greek erion, "wool", and gonu, "joint or knee", in reference to the hairy or woolly joints of some of the species of the genus, but not particularly inflatum. It is found in the Mojave Desert and other deserts.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Desert Trumpet, provide full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid habitat. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization. This plant is well-suited to drought conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to poor, rocky desert soils and does not require rich nutrients. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
