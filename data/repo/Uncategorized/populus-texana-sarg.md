## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico) and northern Mexico, primarily along riparian corridors. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Riparian Woodland within Semi-Arid to Arid regions. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. Requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day, as it is typically found in open, unshaded areas along riverbanks. |
| **💧 Water** | High. Thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, often drawing from groundwater near rivers and streams. Tolerates periodic flooding but not prolonged drought in its root zone. |

## 🌱 Overview
Populus is a genus of 25–30 species of deciduous flowering plants in the family Salicaceae, native to most of the Northern Hemisphere. English names variously applied to different species include poplar (), aspen, and cottonwood.
The western balsam poplar (P. trichocarpa) was the first tree to have its full DNA code determined by DNA sequencing, in 2006.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Texas Cottonwood requires full sun exposure and consistently moist soil, mimicking its native riparian habitat along rivers. While tolerant of a range of soils, it thrives in fertile, well-drained conditions with constant access to water. Ensure adequate moisture, especially when young, to support its rapid growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from fertile, well-draining soil, often enriched by deposited sediments in its riparian habitat. A general-purpose fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil quality is poor, but heavy fertilization is usually not required once established.
