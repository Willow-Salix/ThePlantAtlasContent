## 🧤 Care Instructions
Largeflower Sage is a highly drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its arid native climate. It requires infrequent watering once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Native to lean soils, it thrives without much intervention. If growth appears weak, a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring.
