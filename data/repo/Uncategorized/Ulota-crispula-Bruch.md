## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe (e.g., UK, Ireland, Scandinavia), North America (e.g., Eastern North America, Pacific Northwest), and parts of Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest, often in humid woodland environments. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial Shade to Full Shade. Naturally grows on tree bark or rocks, often under the canopy, meaning it thrives in indirect light conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently Moist, High Humidity. Its native habitat provides regular rainfall and high ambient humidity; it should never be allowed to dry out completely, but also not sit in stagnant water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ulota is a genus of mosses comprising 69 species with a worldwide distribution, though most species are found in the southern hemisphere.
They have commonly been grouped within the genus Orthotrichum, though recently they have been placed in their own genus. Their phylogeny and taxonomy have been an area of debate ever since they were placed in their own genus, though it has been largely accepted to place Ulota as a genus of their own. They can be found growing on trees close to the coast, though some species are also found on rocks. Their shoots form small tufts to large mats across habitats, often intertwined with other mosses, including Orthotrichum species.
Ulota reproduce using sexual structures, sporangium (plural: sporangia), that are terminal on the shoot. The calyptra covering the developing sporangium can be hairy or not hairy depending on the species, but the hairs extend from the sporangium base to the apex as opposed to the calyptra hairs of Polytrichum mosses which extend from the apex to the base.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in environments mimicking its temperate forest home, requiring consistent moisture and high humidity with indirect light or shade. Avoid direct sun and allow for good air circulation to prevent fungal issues, while fertilization is generally unnecessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very Low to None. As a bryophyte, it has minimal nutrient requirements, typically absorbing what it needs from rainwater and the environment; excessive fertilization can be harmful.
