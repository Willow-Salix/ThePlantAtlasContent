## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low, drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during dry seasons. Requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Linanthus is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the phlox family Polemoniaceae. The species are found in western North America and in Chile, with the greatest diversity in California.
The stems are erect, with multiple branches arising directly from the base, and grow 2–15 cm tall. The leaves are stem-like (cauline) and opposite, with shapes ranging from entire to palmately lobed, the 3-9 lobes being linear to lanceolate or spatulate. Flowers have a tubular calyx, and the corolla may be funnel- or bell-shaped, or salverform.
The genus name is from the Greek for "flax flower", since the flowers superficially resemble those of flax. The genus has recently been split, with many of the species formerly included now transferred to the genus Leptosiphon (Jepson Manual).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native Mediterranean chaparral habitat. Water sparingly, only when the soil is completely dry, and avoid excessive fertilization to ensure its health and vigor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None to very minimal. This plant thrives in lean, poor soils and does not require rich nutrients; over-fertilization can be detrimental.
