## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western Asia to Central Asia (e.g., Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-arid to arid continental climate, specifically within riparian zones along rivers, wadis, and streams. Characterized by hot, dry summers and cool to cold winters. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. This species thrives in open areas with high light exposure, typical for riparian willows in its native range. |
| **💧 Water** | High. Despite the arid regional climate, it is a riparian species, requiring consistently moist to wet soil conditions. It is not drought-tolerant and needs regular, ample watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Salix Oxica Dode, likely a willow from Western to Central Asian riparian zones, thrives in full sun with abundant water. It requires consistently moist to wet soil and is not drought-tolerant, needing regular watering to mimic its natural habitat. Provide moderate fertilization to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. While adaptable to various soil types, it benefits from average to rich soil. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied annually in spring to support growth.
