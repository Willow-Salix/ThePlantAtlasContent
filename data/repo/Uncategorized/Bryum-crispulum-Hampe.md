## 🌱 Overview
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in consistently moist, humid environments with indirect to partial sun. Avoid direct, intense sunlight and ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. It requires minimal to no fertilization, growing well in nutrient-poor substrates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. If desired, a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/10th strength) can be applied very sparingly once or twice a year.
