## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (specifically Maui and Hawaii Island) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane Cloud Forest and Subalpine Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun is ideal. It can tolerate full sun in its native high-altitude, frequently cloudy conditions, but protection from intense, prolonged direct sun in warmer climates is advisable. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, but not waterlogged, soil. Mimics the frequent rainfall, high humidity, and condensation typical of its native cloud forest environment. Ensure excellent drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Myrsine is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It was formerly placed in the family Myrsinaceae before this was merged into the Primulaceae. It is found nearly worldwide, primarily in tropical and subtropical areas. It contains over 280 species, including several notable radiations, such as the matipo of New Zealand and the kōlea of Hawaiʻi (the New Zealand "black matipo", Pittosporum tenuifolium, is not related to Myrsine). In the United States, members of this genus are known as colicwood. Some species, especially M. africana, are grown as ornamental shrubs.
The leathery, evergreen leaves are simple and alternate, with smooth or toothed margins and without stipules. The one-seeded, indehiscent fruit is a thin-fleshed globose drupe. The flowers and fruits often do not develop until after leaf fall and thus appear naked on the branches. The fruits often do not mature until the year after flowering. The calyx is persistent.
The Pacific basin and New World species formerly separated in the genera Rapanea and Suttonia (distinguished from the African and Southeast Asian Myrsine sensu stricto by having the style absent and staminal tube and filaments completely adnate to the corolla) are now generally included in Myrsine.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Cloudswept Colicwood, replicate its high-altitude, misty Hawaiian home by providing consistently moist, well-drained soil and high humidity. It thrives in bright, indirect to partial sun conditions and benefits from infrequent, light fertilization during growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
A light application of a balanced liquid fertilizer once a month or every other month during its active growing season is sufficient. Native soils are often volcanic and can be moderately fertile but also subject to leaching.
