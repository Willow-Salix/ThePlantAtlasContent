## 🌱 Overview
Ardisia (coralberry or marlberry) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It was in the former Myrsinaceae family now recognised as the myrsine sub-family Myrsinoideae. They are distributed in the Americas, Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, mainly in the tropics. There are over 700 accepted species. One species, Ardisia japonica is one of the 50 fundamental herbs in traditional Chinese medicine.
These are trees, shrubs, and subshrubs. Most have alternately arranged leaves. Flowers are borne in many forms of inflorescence. The flowers have usually 4 or 5 green sepals and a bell-shaped corolla of usually 4 or 5 white or pink petals. The fruit is a somewhat fleshy drupe. The defining characteristic of the genus is the small tube formed at the center of the flower by the stamens, which are joined at their bases.
Several Ardisia species are the sources of the chemical compounds known as ardisiaquinones.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical understory plant thrives in bright indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its native humid forest environment. Provide moderate humidity and a diluted feeding schedule during warmer months to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during fall and winter.
