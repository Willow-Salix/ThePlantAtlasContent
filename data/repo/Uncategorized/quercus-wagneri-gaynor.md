# Hybrid Oak
### *Quercus Ã—wagneri Gaynor*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (based on likely parent species) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight) for optimal growth and health, though young trees can tolerate partial shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Needs moderate and consistent watering, especially during its establishment phase and dry periods. Established trees demonstrate some drought tolerance but benefit from supplemental water during prolonged dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
An oak is a hardwood tree or shrub in the genus Quercus of the beech family. They have spirally arranged leaves, often with lobed edges, and a nut called an acorn, borne within a cup. The genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, with some 500 species, both deciduous and evergreen. Fossil oaks date back to the Middle Eocene. Molecular phylogeny shows that the genus is divided into Old World and New World clades, but many oak species hybridise freely, making the genus's history difficult to resolve.
Ecologically, oaks are keystone species in habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest. They live in association with many kinds of fungi including truffles. Oaks support more than 950 species of caterpillar, many kinds of gall wasp which form distinctive galls (roundish woody lumps such as the oak apple), and a large number of pests and diseases. Oak leaves and acorns contain enough tannin to be toxic to cattle, but pigs are able to digest them safely. Oak timber is strong and hard, and has found many uses in construction and furniture-making. The bark was traditionally used for tanning leather. Wine barrels are made of oak; these are used for aging alcoholic beverages such as sherry and whisky, giving them a range of flavours, colours, and aromas. The spongy bark of the cork oak is used to make traditional wine bottle corks. Almost a third of oak species are threatened with extinction due to climate change, invasive pests, and habitat loss.
In culture, the oak tree is a symbol of strength and serves as the national tree of many countries. In Indo-European and related religions, the oak is associated with thunder gods. Individual oak trees of cultural significance include the Royal Oak in Britain, the Charter Oak in the United States, and the Guernica Oak in the Basque Country.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid oak, accustomed to the temperate deciduous forests of Eastern and Central North America, thrives best in full sun with moderate, consistent moisture. It requires minimal fertilization, focusing primarily on establishment and poor soil conditions, ensuring well-drained soil for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization is generally sufficient. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or well-rotted compost in early spring, particularly beneficial for young trees or those in nutrient-deficient soils.
