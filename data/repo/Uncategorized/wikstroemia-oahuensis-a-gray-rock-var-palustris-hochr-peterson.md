## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Oahu False Ohelo thrives in consistently moist, bog-like conditions reminiscent of its native Hawaiian wet forest and bog habitats. It prefers partial sun to partial shade with high humidity. Ensure the soil never dries out and fertilize sparingly, if at all, during the active growing season to avoid nutrient burn.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization, if any, during the growing season. Plants adapted to boggy, often nutrient-poor soils do not require heavy feeding. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
