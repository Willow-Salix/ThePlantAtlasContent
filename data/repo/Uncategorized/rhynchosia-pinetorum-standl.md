## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in bright, sunny conditions, mimicking its native Central American tropical dry forests. It requires moderate watering during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry out completely between applications, and minimal water during its dormant dry season. Fertilization should be light and infrequent, primarily during the growing months.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization once or twice during the active growing season with a balanced, diluted fertilizer. No fertilization is needed during dormancy.
