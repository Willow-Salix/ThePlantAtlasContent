## 🌱 Overview
Aeschynomene is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae, and was recently assigned to the informal monophyletic Dalbergia clade of the Dalbergieae. They are known commonly as jointvetches. They range across tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, south, southeast, and east Asia, and Australia. These legumes are most common in warm regions and many species are aquatic.
The genus as currently circumscribed is paraphyletic and it has been suggested that the subgenus Ochopodium be elevated to a new genus within the Dalbergieae, though other changes will also be required to render the genus monophyletic. Plants of the World Online currently accepts 114 species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical legume thrives in warm, humid conditions with abundant sunlight, mimicking its native Caribbean habitat. Ensure the soil remains consistently moist, especially during warmer months, but avoid waterlogging. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, provide light to moderate fertilization with a general-purpose blend.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so high-nitrogen fertilizers are often unnecessary.
