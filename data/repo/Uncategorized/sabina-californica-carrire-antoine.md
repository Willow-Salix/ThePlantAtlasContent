## 🧤 Care Instructions
The California Juniper thrives in full sun and dry conditions, mimicking its native arid and Mediterranean environments. Provide very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to fully dry between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils. Minimal to no fertilization is required, especially in established plants.
