## 🧤 Care Instructions
Macoun's arthothelium lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with filtered light, typical of the Pacific Northwest temperate rainforest. Maintaining very high humidity and consistent moisture is paramount, while traditional fertilization is unnecessary and should be avoided.
