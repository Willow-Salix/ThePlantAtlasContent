## 🧤 Care Instructions
Alpine Avens thrives in cool, sunny alpine conditions with consistently moist, well-drained soil. It tolerates full sun to partial shade and requires minimal fertilization. This hardy plant is ideal for rock gardens or alpine beds where it can mimic its native environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring if soil is poor, otherwise minimal or none as it's adapted to nutrient-scarce alpine soils.
