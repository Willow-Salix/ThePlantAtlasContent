| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with its open coastal and disturbed habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant, accustomed to dry summers typical of its native climate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Coastal Cryptantha thrives in full sun and very well-draining, sandy soils, mimicking its native coastal scrubland environment. This drought-tolerant plant requires infrequent watering once established and has minimal to no fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny locations.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required. Its natural habitat often features sandy, nutrient-poor soils, indicating it does not need rich feeding.
