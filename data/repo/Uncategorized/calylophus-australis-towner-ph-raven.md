## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy plant thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established. It prefers well-draining soil and generally does not need heavy fertilization, reflecting its origins in open, semi-arid regions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization is sufficient; apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring if needed, but often thrives in leaner soils.
