## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide bright, indirect light and maintain high humidity, similar to its native tropical forest environment. Water frequently but ensure good drainage and allow roots to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize regularly with a very dilute solution to support its epiphytic growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Weak, dilute fertilizer applied regularly, as epiphytes typically receive nutrients from decaying organic matter rather than rich soil.
