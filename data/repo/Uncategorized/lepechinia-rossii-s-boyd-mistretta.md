## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (endemic to Monterey County) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Woodland / Chaparral (Arid Scrubland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open habitat in chaparral and cismontane woodlands. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water regularly during active growth (cooler seasons like spring), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires minimal to no water during hot, dry summer months when it is typically dormant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lepechinia is a genus of plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It includes several species of plants known commonly as pitchersages (also pitcher sages). Plants of this genus can be found in Central and South America, Mexico, California, Hispaniola, and Hawaii, although the species in Hawaii is probably a human introduction. Many of them bear attractive pitcher-shaped flowers, often in shades of purple. The genus was named for the Russian botanist Ivan Ivanovich Lepechin. In 2011, the two monotypic genera Chaunostoma and Neoeplingia were shown to be part of Lepechinia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ross' pitcher sage thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native California chaparral environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing consistent watering during its active growing season but very little during summer dormancy. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to leaner soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor to moderate soils; light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula in early spring is usually sufficient, or often not needed at all.
