## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in conditions mimicking its native alpine/subalpine rocky outcrops. Provide bright indirect to partial direct sun and consistent moisture with excellent drainage, allowing for brief dry spells. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, as it naturally subsists on low nutrient levels.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Minimal to no fertilizer required; excess nutrients can be detrimental.
