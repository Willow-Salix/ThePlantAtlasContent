## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Rocky Mountains of North America (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, Utah) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra/Alpine Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), thrives in high light intensity. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out significantly between waterings. Requires excellent drainage and tolerates periods of drought once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine clover thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage to mimic its native high-altitude, rocky habitats. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and avoid rich, heavily fertilized soils, especially those high in nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Prefers lean, well-drained, often rocky or gravelly soils. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen.
