| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Montane Moist Broadleaf Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light or dappled shade; avoid direct midday sun, especially during the hottest parts of the day. Mimic understory conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Abundant watering during the active growing season (spring and summer), allowing the potting medium to dry slightly between waterings. Significantly reduce watering during the cooler, drier dormant period in winter. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dendrobium is a genus of mostly epiphytic and lithophytic orchids in the family Orchidaceae. It is a very large genus, containing more than 1,800 species that are found in diverse habitats throughout much of south, east and southeast Asia, including China, Japan, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, New Guinea, Vietnam and many of the islands of the Pacific. Orchids in this genus have roots that creep over the surface of trees or rocks, rarely having their roots in soil. Up to six leaves develop in a tuft at the tip of a shoot and from one to a large number of flowers are arranged along an unbranched flowering stem. Several attempts have been made to separate Dendrobium into smaller genera, but most have not been accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This orchid thrives by mimicking its native subtropical montane forest habitat with distinct seasonal changes. Provide bright, indirect light, high humidity, and ample water and nutrients during its warm, active growing season. A cooler, drier winter rest period is crucial for successful blooming.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Apply a balanced orchid fertilizer at half strength every 2-3 weeks during active growth. Cease fertilization entirely during the dormant period.
