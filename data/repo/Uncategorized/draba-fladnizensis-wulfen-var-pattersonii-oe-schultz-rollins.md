## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | High alpine regions of western North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to very high light exposure, mimicking its open, treeless alpine habitat above the treeline. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture during the short growing season, but critically requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Allow soil to dry slightly between waterings, similar to snowmelt-fed conditions followed by evaporation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Draba is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, commonly known as whitlow-grasses (though they are not related to the true grasses).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant requires full sun and exceptionally well-drained, rocky soil. Water moderately during its short growing season, ensuring not to overwater to prevent root rot. Fertilizer needs are minimal due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Over-fertilization can be harmful. A minimal, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly, if at all, during the growing season is sufficient.
