## 🌱 Overview
Machaeranthera is a genus of North American flowering plants in the family Asteraceae which are known by the common name tansyaster.
Tansyasters are variable in appearance. Some are small, singular wildflowers, while others are sprawling shrubs. Several species easily hybridize with each other, as well, making identification difficult. In general, members of the genus may be identified by the sharp-pointed, dagger-shaped anthers in the disc florets at the center of the flower. The flower heads are usually daisylike, and are usually a shade of purple or blue, but may be pink, yellow, or white. Tansyasters are native to western North America.
The genus Machaeranthera is distinguished from the genus Dieteria by having once- or twice-pinnate leaves, whereas Dieteria has entire to toothed leaves.
Machaeranthera means "swordlike anthers".

This desert native thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, mimicking its arid homeland. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization is rarely needed, supporting its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in poor, well-draining soils and does not require rich nutrients.
