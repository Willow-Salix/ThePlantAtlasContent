| **🌍 Origin** | China (Gansu, Shaanxi provinces) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. While it tolerates some shade, it typically performs best and grows most vigorously in full sun. |
| **💧 Water** | High. Requires consistent moisture, especially during warm growing seasons. Water regularly to keep soil moist but not waterlogged, mimicking rainfall in its native monsoon-influenced climate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Phyllostachys ()
is a genus of Asian bamboo in the grass family.  Many of the species are found in central and southern China, with a few species in northern Indochina and in the Himalayas. Some of the species have become naturalized in parts of Asia, South America, Australia, and southern Europe.
The stem or culm has a prominent groove, called a sulcus, that runs along the length of each segment (or internode).  Because of this, it is one of the most easily identifiable genera of bamboo. Most of the species spread aggressively by underground rhizomes. Being pioneer plants, phyllostachys species will not spread quickly or achieve mature height without access to direct sunlight throughout most of the day.
Some species of Phyllostachys grow to 100 ft (30 m) tall in optimum conditions.  Some of the larger species, sometimes known as "timber bamboo", are used as construction timber and for making furniture. Several species are cultivated as ornamental plants, though they can become invasive and troublesome in gardens, unless artificially restricted or grown in containers.
The name Phyllostachys means "leaf spike" and refers to the inflorescences.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Originating from temperate forests in China, Beautiful Bamboo thrives in full sun to partial shade. It demands consistently moist, well-drained soil, particularly during warm growing periods, and benefits significantly from regular fertilization to maintain its robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Benefits from regular fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or high-nitrogen feed to support its vigorous growth.
