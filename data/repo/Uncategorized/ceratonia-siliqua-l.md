## 🌱 Overview
The carob ( KARR-əb; Ceratonia siliqua) is a flowering evergreen tree or shrub in the Caesalpinioideae subfamily of the legume family, Fabaceae. The carob tree is native to the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. It is widely cultivated for its edible fruit, which takes the form of seed pods, and as an ornamental tree in gardens and landscapes. Spain is its largest producer, followed by Italy and Morocco.
Carob pods have a number of culinary applications, including a powder or chips that can be used as a chocolate alternative. The seeds are used to produce locust bean gum or carob gum, a common thickening agent used in food processing.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
St. John's Bread thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its Mediterranean origins. It requires minimal watering once established due to its excellent drought tolerance, though young plants need more consistent moisture. Fertilizer needs are low, with occasional feeding beneficial for growth and fruit production.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate needs. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost can be applied in spring, especially for young or fruiting trees, but it is not a heavy feeder.
