## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (Sierra Nevada Foothills, South Coast Ranges, San Francisco Bay Area, Central Western California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating high sun exposure in its native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during its active growth season (typically winter/spring); highly drought-tolerant once established and prefers dry conditions during summer dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Calystegia (bindweed, false bindweed, or morning glory) is a genus of about 25 species of flowering plants in the bindweed family Convolvulaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution in temperate and subtropical regions, but with half of the species endemic to California.  They are annual or herbaceous perennial twining vines growing 1–5 m tall, with spirally arranged leaves. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, 3–10 cm diameter, white or pink, with (in most species) a sometimes inflated basal epicalyx.
The genus bears much similarity to a related genus Convolvulus, and is sometimes combined with it; it is distinguished primarily by the pollen being smooth, and in the ovary being unilocular.
Some of the species, notably Calystegia sepium and C. silvatica, are problematic weeds, which can swamp other more valuable plants by climbing over them, but some are also deliberately grown for their attractive flowers.
Calystegia species are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Bedellia somnulentella (recorded on C. sepium) and small angle shades.
The name is derived from two Greek words κάλυξ (kálux) "cup", and στέγη (stégē) "a covering", meaning "covering cup", this refers to the large bracts that cover the sepals.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native thrives in Mediterranean conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade and moderate watering during its active winter/spring growing season. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal water in summer, and generally performs best in lean to moderately fertile soils without extensive fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. This plant is adapted to less fertile soils common in its native habitat and generally does not require rich feeding.
