## 🧤 Care Instructions
Macoun's Lupine prefers full sun and well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering but is drought-tolerant once established, and as a nitrogen-fixing plant, it has very low fertilizer requirements.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, particularly nitrogen. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. If needed, a low-nitrogen fertilizer or bone meal can be applied annually.
