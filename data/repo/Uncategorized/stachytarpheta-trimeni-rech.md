## 🌱 Overview
Stachytarpheta is a plant genus in the verbena family (Verbenaceae). The flowers are rich in nectar and popular with many butterflies, such as the South Asian crimson rose, Malabar banded swallowtail, and grass yellow. Hummingbirds, especially small species like Lophornis coquettes, Chlorostilbon emeralds, and Discosura thorntails, are especially attracted for nectar. Several species in this genus are known as porterweeds. In Australia the genus is known as snakeweed.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid porterweed thrives in full sun and warm conditions, preferring consistently moist soil but tolerating brief dry spells once established. Provide light to moderate fertilization during its active growth phase to encourage prolific blooming and healthy foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring through summer) is sufficient; use a balanced fertilizer, avoiding excessive nitrogen which can hinder flowering.
