## 🌱 Overview
Mimosa is a genus of about 600 species of herbs and shrubs, in the mimosoid clade of the legume family Fabaceae. Species are native to the Americas, from North Dakota to northern Argentina, and to eastern Africa (Tanzania, Mozambique, and Madagascar) as well as the Indian subcontinent and Indochina. The generic name is derived from the Greek word μῖμος (mimos), 'actor' or 'mime', and the feminine suffix -osa, 'resembling', suggesting its 'sensitive leaves' which seem to 'mimic conscious life'.
Two species in the genus are especially notable. One is Mimosa pudica, commonly known as touch-me-not, which folds its leaves when touched or exposed to heat. It is native to southern Central and South America but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value, both as a houseplant in temperate areas, and outdoors in the tropics. Outdoor cultivation has led to weedy invasion in some areas, notably Hawaii. The other is Mimosa tenuiflora, which is best known for its use in shamanic ayahuasca brews due to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine found in its root bark.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Urban's mimosa requires full sun exposure and well-draining soil to thrive, mimicking its native Brazilian savanna conditions. Water moderately during its active growth period, allowing for some drying between sessions, and fertilize lightly due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season.
