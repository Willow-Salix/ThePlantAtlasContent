## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Rocky Mountains (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Utah) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine/Subalpine Montane Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, typically found in open meadows or woodland edges where it receives ample light but may appreciate some protection from intense afternoon sun, especially in warmer regions. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil, reflecting the regular moisture from snowmelt and summer precipitation in its native habitat; requires well-draining conditions to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Aconitum (), also known as aconite, monkshood, wolfsbane, leopard's bane, devil's helmet, or blue rocket, is a genus of over 250 species of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. These herbaceous, frequently toxic perennial plants are chiefly native to the mountainous parts of the Northern Hemisphere in North America, Europe, and Asia, growing in the moisture-retentive but well-draining soils of mountain meadows.
Most Aconitum species are extremely poisonous and must be handled very carefully.  Several Aconitum hybrids, such as the Arendsii form of Aconitum carmichaelii, have won gardening awards—such as the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Some are used by florists.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Viviparous Monkshood thrives in cool, high-altitude conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil to mimic its native habitat. A moderate spring fertilization can enhance its health and growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can support vigorous growth, typical for plants in reasonably fertile alpine soils.
