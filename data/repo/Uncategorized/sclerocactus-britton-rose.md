| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Colorado, California, New Mexico) and Northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Desert and High Desert Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure; requires full sun to partial sun. Needs intense light to thrive and maintain compact growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly in fall and cease almost entirely in winter. |

## 🌱 Overview
Fishhook cactus is a common name for any hook-spined species of the genera Mammillaria, Echinomastus, Sclerocactus, or Cochemiea. They are small cacti, usually growing up to 6-7 inches (20 cm) high, and are shaped similar to a barrel cactus. They are not to be confused with the fishhook barrel cactus (Ferocactus wislizenii) of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. The Fishhook cactus is a large category of around 150 species.
Good places to see "fishhook" Mammillaria are the Sonoran Desert on the U.S. - Mexico border, and the Mesa Verde National Park. Often found growing in desert and rocky locations.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sclerocactus thrives in conditions mimicking its arid desert home, demanding abundant sunlight and very little water. Ensure excellent drainage and allow the soil to dry completely between waterings to prevent root rot, especially during dormancy.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, diluted cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer), or not at all if regularly repotted.
