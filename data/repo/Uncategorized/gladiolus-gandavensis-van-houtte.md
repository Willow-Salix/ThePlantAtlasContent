## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South Africa (derived from parent species) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Grassland with distinct wet and dry seasons |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to promote robust growth and abundant flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular and consistent watering during the active growing season (spring through summer) to keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged. Reduce watering significantly or cease during the dormancy period. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gladiolus (from Latin, the diminutive of gladius, a sword) is a genus of perennial cormous flowering plants in the iris family (Iridaceae).

It is sometimes called the 'sword lily', but is usually called by its generic name (plural gladioli).
The genus occurs in Asia, Mediterranean Europe, South Africa, and tropical Africa. The center of diversity is in the Cape Floristic Region. The genera Acidanthera, Anomalesia, Homoglossum, and Oenostachys, formerly considered distinct, are now included in Gladiolus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gladiolus thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its South African grassland origins. Provide consistent moisture during its growing and flowering phases, while reducing water significantly during dormancy. Fertilize moderately throughout the active growth period to support vigorous blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; benefit from a balanced granular or liquid fertilizer applied every 2-4 weeks during their active growth period, from sprout emergence until flowering.
