## 🌱 Overview
Cuscuta (), commonly known as dodder or amarbel, is a genus of over 201 species of yellow, orange, or red (rarely green) parasitic plants. Formerly treated as the only genus in the family Cuscutaceae, it now is accepted as belonging in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae, on the basis of the work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world, with the greatest species diversity in subtropical and tropical regions; the genus becomes rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern Europe.
Folk names include strangle tare, strangleweed, scaldweed, beggarweed, lady's laces, fireweed, wizard's net, devil's guts, devil's hair, devil's ringlet, goldthread, hailweed, hairweed, hellbine, love vine, pull-down, angel hair, and witch's hair.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Boldingh's dodder is a parasitic plant requiring a suitable host and thrives in full sun to bright light. It prefers warm conditions typical of tropical dry climates, with moderate watering that allows for periods of dryness between applications. Direct fertilization is not needed for the dodder itself.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None directly for the dodder itself, as it is a parasitic plant that extracts all necessary nutrients from its host plant.
