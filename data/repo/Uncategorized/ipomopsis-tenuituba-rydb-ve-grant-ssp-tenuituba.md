## 🧤 Care Instructions
Slendertube Skyrocket thrives in full sun and well-draining, poor to average soils, reflecting its semi-arid montane origins. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering only after the soil has thoroughly dried out. Minimal fertilization is sufficient for this robust native.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to average, well-draining soils. Minimal or no fertilization is typically required, perhaps a very light, balanced feed annually in extremely nutrient-poor conditions.
