## 🌱 Overview
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. Species are distributed widely – from Quebec to northern Argentina in the Americas, across northern and southern tropical Africa, in the southern Arabian Peninsula, in Myanmar and Thailand, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland environment. Provide full sun and water infrequently but deeply, ensuring the soil dries out between waterings. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can fix nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilization. If needed, a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year in spring.
