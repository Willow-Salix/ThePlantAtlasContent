It requires no traditional watering or fertilization, deriving moisture from the air and nutrients from dust and rain, making it sensitive to pollutants.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None required; highly sensitive to nutrient pollution and traditional fertilizers, absorbing all needs directly from air and rain.
