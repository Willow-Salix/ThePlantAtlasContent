## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas), Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | High light, tolerant of direct sun exposure on exposed rock faces. |
| **💧 Water** | Very infrequent; naturally receives moisture from sparse rainfall or dew, tolerating long periods of desiccation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Psorotichia is a genus of saxicolous (rock-dwelling) lichens in the family Lichinaceae. The genus can be distinguished from other rock-dwelling lichens by its distinctive dark colouration and granular texture. Unlike many lichens that form leafy or branched structures, Psorotichia species create only thin, crusty patches that blend closely with the rock surface. Their small fruiting bodies are often difficult to spot without magnification, appearing as tiny dark dots embedded in the crust.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Psorotichia lichen thrives in high light conditions on exposed rocks in arid environments. It requires very infrequent watering, relying on occasional natural moisture, and does not need traditional fertilization as it absorbs nutrients directly from its surroundings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None; lichens obtain necessary nutrients directly from the air and their substrate.
