## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate, boreal, and subalpine/alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America (e.g., Canada, northern US), Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Boreal and Subalpine/Alpine, often found in moist, acidic bogs, peatlands, or damp soil/rock crevices. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers partial shade to indirect light. Direct, intense sunlight should be avoided as it can quickly dry out and damage the moss. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist to wet conditions, mimicking its native boggy or damp soil habitats. The substrate should be kept constantly damp, but not waterlogged. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Blind's Bryum Moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and acidic environments, typical of its native subalpine/boreal bogs and damp soils. It requires partial shade or indirect light and frequent watering to maintain a damp substrate, while fertilizer is generally unnecessary for its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs. Fertilization is generally not required; high nutrient levels can be detrimental to mosses.
