## 🌱 Overview
Eugenia is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family Myrtaceae. It has a worldwide, although highly uneven, distribution in tropical and subtropical regions. The bulk of the approximately 1,100 species occur in the New World tropics, especially in the eastern Brazil's northern Andes, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Forest (coastal forests). Other centers of diversity include New Caledonia and Madagascar. Many species in the Old World have received a new classification into the genus Syzygium.
All species are woody evergreen trees and shrubs. Several are grown as ornamental plants for their attractive glossy foliage, and a few produce edible fruit that are eaten fresh or used in jams and jellies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Boxleaf Stopper is a hardy subtropical plant that adapts well to various light conditions, from full sun to partial shade. It prefers consistent moisture but can tolerate periods of drought once established, making it relatively low-maintenance. Light fertilization during the growing season is sufficient to support its slow growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season, particularly if the plant is in poor soil or showing nutrient deficiencies.
