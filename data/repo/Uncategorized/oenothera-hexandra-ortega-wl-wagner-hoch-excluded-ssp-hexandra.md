| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Chile |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland (Matorral) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), thriving in open, exposed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth (typically winter/spring), allowing soil to dry completely between waterings. Significantly reduce watering during hot, dry summer dormancy. Drought-tolerant once established. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean shrubland environment in Central Chile. Water moderately during active growth, ensuring the soil dries between waterings, and reduce significantly during its summer dormancy. It prefers light fertilization to support its growth in naturally leaner soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/early summer). Avoid over-fertilizing, as native soils are not overly rich.
