| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including the Western United States (e.g., California, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado) and parts of British Columbia, Canada. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane and Subalpine Moist Meadows and Riparian Zones |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, brightly lit environments typical of meadows. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture. Requires regularly moist to wet soil, mimicking its native habitat along streambanks and wet meadows, especially during its active growth period. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Lesser Indian Paintbrush thrives in consistently moist to wet soil under full to partial sun, typical of montane meadows and riparian areas in Western North America. As a hemiparasite, it requires host plants and has very low fertilizer needs, often preferring nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. As a hemiparasitic plant, it derives nutrients from host plants. High phosphorus fertilizers can be detrimental. Best to avoid or use very sparingly.
