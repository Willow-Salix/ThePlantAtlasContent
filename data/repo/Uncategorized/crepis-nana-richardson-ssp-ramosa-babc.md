| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |

| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine zones |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in highly exposed, bright locations. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers well-drained soil and is tolerant of periods of drought once established. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Crepis, commonly known in some parts of the world as hawksbeard or hawk's-beard (but not to be confused with the related genus Hieracium with a similar common name), is a genus of annual and perennial flowering plants of the family Asteraceae superficially resembling the dandelion, the most conspicuous difference being that Crepis usually has branching scapes with multiple heads (though solitary heads can occur). The genus name Crepis derives from the Greek krepis, meaning "slipper" or "sandal", possibly in reference to the shape of the fruit.
The genus is distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and Africa, and several plants are known as introduced species practically worldwide. The center of diversity is in the Mediterranean.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native rocky mountain habitats. It requires moderate watering but is drought-tolerant once established, needing minimal to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary, or very minimal with a diluted, balanced fertilizer once in spring.
