## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Swamp Rose Mallow thrives in full sun and requires abundant water, mimicking its native marshy habitats. Maintain consistently moist to wet soil and provide regular fertilization throughout the growing season for optimal growth and prolific blooms. This plant is well-suited for wet areas or containers where its moisture needs can be met.
