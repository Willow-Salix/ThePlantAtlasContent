## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western Colorado, USA (specifically Moffat and Rio Blanco counties) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Montane Shrubland/Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat on exposed shale outcrops with sparse vegetation. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely low; this plant is highly drought-tolerant, adapted to arid conditions. Water very infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between deep waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Yampa River Cryptantha requires conditions that mimic its native arid montane environment: full, intense sun and extremely lean, well-draining soil. Provide minimal water, allowing for extended dry periods, and avoid over-fertilization to ensure its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none; it thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its native barren shale outcrops. Over-fertilization could be detrimental.
