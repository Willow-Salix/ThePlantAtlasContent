## 🌱 Overview
Sideroxylon is a genus of trees in the family Sapotaceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753. They are collectively known as bully trees. The generic name is derived from the Greek words σιδηρος (sideros), meaning "iron", and ξύλον (xylon), meaning "wood."

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained, sandy soils typical of its native scrublands. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and fertilize sparingly, as it is adapted to lower nutrient levels.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils, so infrequent, light fertilization with a balanced formula is sufficient, primarily in spring.
