## 🌱 Overview
Coryphantha (from Greek, "flowering on the top"), or beehive cactus, is a genus of small to middle-sized, globose or columnar cacti.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arid montane cactus thrives in bright, sunny conditions, mimicking its native Kaibab Plateau habitat. Provide full sun and practice infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to fully dry out between sessions. Fertilize very sparingly with a specialized cactus formula during its growing period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. A diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
