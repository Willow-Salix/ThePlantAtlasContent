## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Mojave Desert regions of California and Nevada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Desert (Mojave Desert Scrubland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its exposed desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic sporadic desert rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Mojave Desert native thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, adapting well to drought conditions. It prefers lean, well-draining soil and typically needs minimal to no fertilization to flourish.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. It is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils, so rich soil or heavy feeding can be detrimental.
