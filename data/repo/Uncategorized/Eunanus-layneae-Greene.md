| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (specifically Sierra Nevada foothills and inner North Coast Ranges) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate / Dry-Summer Sub-humid |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Layne's Monkeyflower thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native dry-summer Mediterranean habitat. Water sparingly once established, especially during summer dormancy, and avoid over-fertilization to maintain its natural vigor.
