## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native Southern California Mediterranean climate. Provide full sun and ensure well-draining soil to prevent rot. Water during the cooler, active growing season (fall to spring), and allow it to experience a dry, dormant period through the hot summer.
