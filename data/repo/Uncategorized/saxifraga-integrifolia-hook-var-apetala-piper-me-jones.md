## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountain regions) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Meadows (Temperate Mountainous) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun in cooler climates or partial afternoon shade in hotter regions to protect from intense heat. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist during the growing season (spring through early summer), ensuring excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Reduce watering significantly after flowering and during cooler dormant periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in well-draining, consistently moist soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, particularly in areas with warm afternoons. Emulate its native subalpine conditions by providing excellent drainage and avoiding overly rich soil or waterlogging to ensure healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, dilute fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial, but avoid over-fertilization as it can lead to weak growth.
