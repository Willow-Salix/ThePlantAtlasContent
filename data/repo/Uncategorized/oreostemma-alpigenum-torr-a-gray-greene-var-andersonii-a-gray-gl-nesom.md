## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, particularly high elevations in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges (e.g., California, Oregon, Nevada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun. As an alpine plant, it thrives in open, treeless environments with direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, ensuring excellent drainage. While accustomed to moisture from snowmelt, its native soils are well-drained, preventing waterlogging. Allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings during the growing season. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tundra Aster requires conditions similar to its native alpine habitat: full sun and excellent drainage are paramount. Provide moderate, consistent moisture during the growing season but ensure the soil never becomes waterlogged. Avoid rich soils and heavy fertilization, as it prefers lean, rocky environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Alpine plants are adapted to lean, rocky soils and can be sensitive to excessive nutrients. If needed, a very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
