## 🌱 Overview
Dyssodia is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Many species formerly included in Dyssodia are now treated as members of other related genera, including Thymophylla or Adenophyllum. Dyssodia papposa is usually retained in this genus.  The name is derived from the Greek δυσοδια (dusodia), meaning "ill-smelling".
Several species of Dyssodia (sensu lato) have found their way into the nursery trade and are relatively popular flowering annuals for hot, dry sites.  Generally sold as threadleaf dyssodia (Dyssodia tenuisecta) and golden dyssodia (Dyssodia cf. pentachaeta).  They perform best in well-drained soil.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in sunny, dry conditions mimicking its native arid environments. It requires minimal watering once established and is well-suited for xeriscaping, rarely needing supplemental fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; typically thrives in poor soils and does not require regular fertilization. A very light, balanced fertilizer application once a year in spring might be beneficial if growth is slow.
