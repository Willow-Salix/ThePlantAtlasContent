## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Native to much of Africa, the Mediterranean Basin (southern Europe, North Africa), and parts of Western Asia (e.g., Arabian Peninsula, extending eastwards). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean, Subtropical Grassland, and Savanna. |
| **☀️ Light** | This grass thrives in full sun, reflecting its natural habitat in open grasslands and savannas where it receives direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Given its origins in regions with distinct wet and dry seasons, it is drought-tolerant once established. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during warmer months; reduce watering in cooler periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hyparrhenia is a genus of grasses. Many species are known commonly as thatching grass.
They are mostly native to tropical Africa; some can be found in warmer areas in temperate Eurasia, Australia, and Latin America. These are annual and perennial bunch grasses. The inflorescence branches into twin spikes of paired spikelets.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thatching Grass requires full sun exposure and is highly drought-tolerant, needing moderate watering with dry periods in between. It is not a heavy feeder and will thrive with minimal fertilization in well-draining soil, reflecting its adaptability to harsh, open environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Native to areas with varying soil fertility, this plant generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring should suffice, or none if grown in reasonably fertile soil.
