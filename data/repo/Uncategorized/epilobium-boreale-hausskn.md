## 🧤 Care Instructions
This circumboreal plant is highly adaptable, thriving in full sun to partial shade and preferring consistently moist, well-drained soil. It requires low to moderate fertility and generally does not need supplemental fertilizer. Its robust nature makes it relatively low-maintenance once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility. It typically thrives in average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization; excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
