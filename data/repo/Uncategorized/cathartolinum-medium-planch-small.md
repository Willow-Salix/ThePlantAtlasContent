# Stiff Yellow Flax
### *Cathartolinum medium (Planch.) Small*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and Central United States |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate grassland and open woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. This plant thrives in open areas, indicating it needs at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for robust growth and flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate. Originating from dry-mesic prairies and open woods, it tolerates some drought but prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry between waterings. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stiff Yellow Flax is a hardy plant native to temperate regions of the U.S., thriving in full to partial sun exposure. It requires moderate watering, preferring well-drained soil that can dry out slightly between waterings, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Mimicking its natural open habitat conditions will promote healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a native prairie plant, it is not a heavy feeder. An annual application of compost or a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring should be sufficient if soil nutrients are poor.
