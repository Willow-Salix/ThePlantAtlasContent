| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa and Australia |

## 🌱 Overview
The bugle is a simple signaling brass instrument with a wide conical bore. It normally has no valves or other pitch-altering devices, and is thus limited to its natural harmonic notes, and pitch is controlled entirely by varying the air and embouchure.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ajuga thrives in partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its woodland origins. Regular watering and a light annual feeding in spring support its vigorous growth and groundcover habit.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer or rich compost in early spring.
