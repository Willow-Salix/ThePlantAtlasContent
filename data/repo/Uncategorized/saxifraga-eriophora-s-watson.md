## 🌱 Overview
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine perennial thrives in full sun and very well-drained, rocky soil, mirroring its native mountainous habitat. Provide moderate water during its active growing season, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and fertilize sparingly, if at all.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Native alpine soils are typically lean. If growth is poor, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in early spring.
