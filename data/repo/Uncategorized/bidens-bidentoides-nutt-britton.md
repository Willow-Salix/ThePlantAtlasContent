## 🌱 Overview
Bidens is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. The genus include roughly 230 species which are distributed worldwide. Despite their global distribution, the systematics and taxonomy of the genus has been described as complicated and unorganized. The common names beggarticks, black jack, burr marigolds, cobbler's pegs, Spanish needles, stickseeds, tickseeds and tickseed sunflowers refer to the fruits of the plants, most of which are bristly and barbed. The generic name refers to the same character; Bidens comes from the Latin bi ("two") and dens ("tooth").

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Delmarva Beggarticks thrives in full sun to partial sun, needing ample direct light. Its care revolves around its wetland origins, demanding consistently moist to wet soil without drying out. A moderate feeding regimen during its growth period will support its annual cycle.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. While wetland soils are often rich in organic matter, an annual herb like this can benefit from a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during its active growing season, especially if grown in less fertile soil.
