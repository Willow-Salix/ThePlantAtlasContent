# California Alsia Moss
### *Alsia californica (Hook. & Arn.) Sull. var. flagellifera (Renauld & Cardot) Sull.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (coastal California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Coastal Forest / Mediterranean Climate with strong coastal influence (foggy, mild, wet winters) |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low, indirect light; thrives in deep shade typical of forest understories or damp ravines. Avoid any direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil or substrate, but never waterlogged. High ambient humidity is crucial, often provided by fog or frequent rainfall in its native habitat. Regular misting or a humid environment (like a terrarium) is ideal. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss requires a consistently humid, shaded environment to mimic its native coastal forest habitat. Ensure the substrate remains moist without being waterlogged, and protect it from any direct sunlight. Fertilization is generally not necessary, as it has very low nutrient demands.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Mosses derive most nutrients from water and the air; over-fertilization can be harmful. If growth seems poor, a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer (1/8 strength) can be applied very sparingly once a year.
