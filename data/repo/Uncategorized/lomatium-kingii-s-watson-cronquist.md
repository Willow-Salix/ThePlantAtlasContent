| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (e.g., California, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Montane Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight) due to its native open, high-altitude, and often treeless habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Low; water infrequently, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, mimicking its native habitat's spring moisture followed by dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.
