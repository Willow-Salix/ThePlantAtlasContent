## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arid and semi-arid regions of Australia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Shrubland / Semi-Arid Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to bright indirect light; typically found in exposed, unshaded locations. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low; lichens absorb moisture from the air and occasional rain. Allow to dry completely between infrequent misting or very light watering, avoiding prolonged wetness. |

## 🌱 Overview
Xanthoparmelia (commonly known as green rock shields or rock-shield lichens) is a genus of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. This genus of lichen is commonly found in the United States, South America, southern Africa, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
The name means 'golden yellow parmelia'. The photobiont (photosynthetic partner) is Trebouxia (a genus of green algae).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in very bright, exposed conditions, mirroring its native arid Australian habitat. It requires extremely infrequent hydration, absorbing moisture from the air or rare rainfall, and must dry out thoroughly between any moisture exposure. No fertilization is needed as it naturally gathers nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None; lichens derive nutrients from the air and substrate. Fertilizers can be harmful and are not necessary.
