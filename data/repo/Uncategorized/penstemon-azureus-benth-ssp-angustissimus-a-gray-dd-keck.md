| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (Sierra Nevada foothills, inner North Coast Ranges) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland / Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), as it grows on open, dry slopes. |

## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Penstemon thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native California chaparral and woodland habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent deep watering during prolonged dry spells. Fertilization needs are minimal, as it prefers lean soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; native soils are often lean. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring if needed, or none in reasonably fertile soil. Avoid high nitrogen.
