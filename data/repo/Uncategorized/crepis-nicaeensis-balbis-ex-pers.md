## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Europe (including France, Italy, Balkan Peninsula) and parts of Western Asia (e.g., Turkey). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean to Temperate, typically found in open grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed areas. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. This plant thrives in exposed locations, mirroring its native habitat in open fields and roadsides where it receives ample sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Prefers well-drained soil and tolerates drying out between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, especially during warmer, drier periods, consistent with its Mediterranean origins. |

## 🌱 Overview
Crepis, commonly known in some parts of the world as hawksbeard or hawk's-beard (but not to be confused with the related genus Hieracium with a similar common name), is a genus of annual and perennial flowering plants of the family Asteraceae superficially resembling the dandelion, the most conspicuous difference being that Crepis usually has branching scapes with multiple heads (though solitary heads can occur). The genus name Crepis derives from the Greek krepis, meaning "slipper" or "sandal", possibly in reference to the shape of the fruit.
The genus is distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and Africa, and several plants are known as introduced species practically worldwide. The center of diversity is in the Mediterranean.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Turkish Hawksbeard is a resilient plant best suited for full to partial sun exposures in well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering, becoming quite drought-tolerant once mature, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer. As it naturally grows in various soil conditions, including disturbed and less fertile sites, heavy fertilization is generally not required. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer may be beneficial if growth seems weak.
