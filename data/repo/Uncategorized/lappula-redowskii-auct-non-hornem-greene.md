## 🧤 Care Instructions
Western Stickseed thrives in full sun and dry conditions, mirroring its native habitats in North American grasslands and arid regions. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring very infrequent watering, and performs well in average to poor soils without much need for fertilization. This makes it an extremely low-maintenance plant suitable for xeriscaping or dry garden areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in average to poor, unfertilized soils, high nutrient levels are not required.
