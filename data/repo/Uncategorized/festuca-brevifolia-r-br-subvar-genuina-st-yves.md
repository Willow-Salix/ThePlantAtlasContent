## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Alpine and arctic regions, including North America (Alaska, Canadian Rockies, Sierra Nevada), Europe (Alps, Pyrenees), and Asia (Siberia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra or Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, high-altitude native habitat above the tree line. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Requires excellent drainage and is intolerant of waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Alpine Fescue is a hardy, cold-adapted grass that thrives in exposed, high-altitude conditions. Provide full sun and ensure excellent soil drainage to mimic its native rocky habitat. Water moderately during the growing season and avoid over-fertilizing.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very dilute, balanced fertilizer, especially if growth appears weak.
