## 🌱 Overview
Acacia, commonly known as wattles or acacias, is a genus of about 1,084 species of shrubs and trees in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the pea family Fabaceae. Initially, it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa, South America, and Australasia, but is now reserved for species mainly from Australia, with others from New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. The genus name is Neo-Latin, borrowed from Koine Greek ἀκακία (akakia), a term used in antiquity to describe a preparation extracted from Vachellia nilotica, the original type species.
Several species of Acacia have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This extremely resilient plant, native to Australia's arid scrublands, flourishes in full sun and requires minimal water once established. It is well-adapted to poor soils and demands very little in terms of fertilization, making it an excellent, low-maintenance choice for dry climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; generally thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization can harm it, especially with nitrogen.
