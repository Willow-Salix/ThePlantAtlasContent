| **🌍 Origin** | Caribbean (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Lesser Antilles) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers low to medium indirect light, mimicking the forest understory. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch its delicate fronds. |

## 🌱 Overview
Thelypteris (maiden ferns) is a genus of ferns in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, family Thelypteridaceae, order Polypodiales. Two radically different circumscriptions of the genus are in use as of January 2020. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the genus is a very small one with about two species. In other approaches, the genus is the only one in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, and so includes between 875 and 1083 species.
The genus name is from Greek thēlys "female" and pteris "fern". However, "female fern" usually refers to the common lady-fern.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, the Heartleaf Maiden Fern needs a consistently moist, but well-draining environment with high humidity and low to medium indirect light. Fertilize lightly during the growing season to support its delicate fronds, ensuring it mimics its native tropical rainforest understory habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder; use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength once a month during the active growing season (spring/summer). Reduce or stop feeding in winter.
