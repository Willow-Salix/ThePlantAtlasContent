## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils, mimicking its native dry grassland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and needs minimal to no fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, typically once a year in early spring with a balanced, slow-release granular product, or often no fertilizer is needed.
