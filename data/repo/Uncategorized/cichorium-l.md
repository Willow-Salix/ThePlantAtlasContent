| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean region, Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate grasslands, Mediterranean shrublands, and open, often disturbed, areas. |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun to partial sun exposure. Thrives in at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, consistent with its growth in open fields. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established due to its deep taproot, reflecting its adaptation to Mediterranean dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Common chicory (Cichorium intybus) is a somewhat woody, perennial herbaceous plant of the family Asteraceae, usually with bright blue flowers, rarely white or pink. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to the Americas and Australia.
Many varieties are cultivated for salad leaves, chicons (blanched buds), or roots (var. sativum), which are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and food additive. In the 21st century, inulin, an extract from chicory root, has been used in food manufacturing as a sweetener and source of dietary fiber. Chicory is also grown as a forage crop for livestock.
