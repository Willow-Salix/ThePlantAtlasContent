## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Woodland/Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to bright, indirect light, mimicking conditions on tree bark beneath a canopy. Avoid intense, direct sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent humidity and moisture from rainfall or dew. Regular misting or high ambient humidity is crucial, allowing the substrate to dry slightly between periods of moisture. Avoid prolonged desiccation or constant saturation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bacidia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. These lichens are characterised by their crustose growth form, distinctive club-shaped reproductive structures called apothecia that contain long, needle-like spores, and their symbiotic partnership with green algae. Bacidia species typically grow on various substrates including tree bark, rock surfaces, and occasionally soil, and are distinguished from related genera by their specific spore characteristics and internal structures.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in temperate, humid environments with filtered light. Ensure high ambient humidity through misting or a humid microclimate, allowing the substrate to dry somewhat between periods of moisture. No additional fertilization is required as nutrients are absorbed from the air.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No conventional fertilizer is needed. Lichens absorb necessary nutrients directly from the air, rain, and their substrate.
