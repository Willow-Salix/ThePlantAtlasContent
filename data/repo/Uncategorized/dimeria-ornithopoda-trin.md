## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across tropical and subtropical Asia (e.g., India, China, Japan, Southeast Asia) and parts of Australia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Grasslands, Forest Margins, and Open Disturbed Areas. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. As a grass commonly found in open fields and forest edges, it thrives with significant light exposure but can tolerate some dappled shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, especially during its active growing season, mimicking the rainfall patterns of its native moist grasslands and paddy fields. Avoid prolonged periods of drought. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dimeria ornithopoda thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist soil, replicating its native tropical and subtropical grassland environments. Fertilize moderately during the growing season with a general-purpose fertilizer to support its vigor, making it a relatively adaptable and low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate application of a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer during its main growing period. It is not typically a heavy feeder given its natural habitat.
