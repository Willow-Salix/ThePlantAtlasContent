## 🧤 Care Instructions
Woods' Rose, subspecies ultramontana, thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting its native montane habitats. While adaptable and drought-tolerant once established, regular watering promotes robust growth and flowering. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is accustomed to less rich native soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. In its native habitat, it adapts to various soil types. A light application of balanced, organic fertilizer in spring can benefit growth, but heavy fertilization is generally not required for this hardy native species.
