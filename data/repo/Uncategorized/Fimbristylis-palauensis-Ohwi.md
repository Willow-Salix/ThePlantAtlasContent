## 🌱 Overview
Fimbristylis is a genus of sedges. A plant in this genus may be known commonly as a fimbry or   fimbristyle. There are over 300 species distributed worldwide. Several continents have native species but many species have been introduced to regions where they are not native. Some are considered weeds. These are typical sedges in appearance, with stiff, ridged stems and cone-shaped terminal panicles of spikelets. They are found in wet environments, and are most diverse in tropical and subtropical regions.
