## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cephalaria flourishes in sunny, open locations with well-drained soil, reflecting its native temperate and Mediterranean habitats. It requires moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry between applications, and tolerates drought once established. Fertilizer needs are minimal, contributing to its low-maintenance appeal.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, or none if planted in reasonably fertile soil.
