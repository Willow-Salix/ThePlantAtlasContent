## 🧤 Care Instructions
Coralbells thrive in partial to full shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Avoid waterlogging while ensuring regular hydration, particularly during dry spells. Fertilization needs are low; a light annual application in spring is generally adequate for healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to light fertilization; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is usually sufficient, as it naturally grows in less nutrient-rich, rocky soils.
