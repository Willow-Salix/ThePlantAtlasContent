## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northeastern North America, including the Great Lakes region (e.g., Michigan, New York, Ontario) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Rocky Uplands (specifically, rocky cliffs and ledges) |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial sun to bright indirect light; can tolerate some morning direct sun but should be protected from harsh afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, allowing the soil to dry considerably between waterings. Avoid overwatering, as it is adapted to well-drained, often dry, rocky crevices. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pellaea is a genus of ferns in the Cheilanthoideae subfamily of the Pteridaceae. The genus name is derived from the Greek word πελλος (pellos), meaning "dark," and refers to the brown stems.  Many members of the genus are commonly known as cliffbrakes. They primarily grow in rocky habitats, including moist rocky canyons, slopes, and bluffs.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid cliffbrake fern thrives in bright, indirect light and requires excellent drainage, tolerating periods of dryness. Water sparingly, allowing the substrate to dry out between sessions, and use fertilizer very infrequently, if at all. Mimicking its rocky habitat is key to its care.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; these ferns are adapted to nutrient-poor rocky substrates. If fertilizing, use a very diluted solution once or twice during the growing season.
