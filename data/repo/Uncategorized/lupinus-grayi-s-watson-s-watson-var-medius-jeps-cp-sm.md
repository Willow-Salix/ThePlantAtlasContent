## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (specifically Peninsular and Transverse Ranges) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it originates from open, exposed environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires moderate watering during the growing season (winter and spring in its native climate) and minimal to no water during hot, dry summers when it may go dormant. Excellent drainage is essential to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gray's Lupine var. medius thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its native Mediterranean Chaparral climate. Once established, it is drought-tolerant, requiring moderate watering during its active growth in cooler months and very little during hot, dry summers. As a nitrogen-fixer, it needs minimal to no supplemental fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers, which can inhibit flowering. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils.
