## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and tropical regions globally, found on all continents except Antarctica. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Wetland biomes, including marshes, swamps, and riparian zones, across temperate and tropical latitudes. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth, thriving in open, unshaded areas common to wetlands. Can tolerate partial shade but growth may be less vigorous. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently wet to submerged conditions. The roots must be perpetually saturated or in standing water to mimic their natural wetland habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Typha  is a genus of about 30 species of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the family Typhaceae. These plants have a variety of common names, in British English bulrush or (mainly historically) reedmace, in American English cattail or punks, in Australia cumbungi or bulrush, in Canada bulrush or cattail, and in New Zealand raupō, bullrush, cattail, or reed.
The genus is largely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, where it is found in a variety of wetland habitats. Although they can accumulate toxins in polluted areas, many parts of the plant are edible, including the starchy rhizomes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cattails are robust wetland plants that demand constant access to water, ideally with their roots submerged, and ample sunlight. Provide full sun exposure and ensure the soil remains perpetually saturated or grow them directly in standing water to mimic their native environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high nutrient requirements. Benefits from nutrient-rich, mucky soils typical of wetlands, which support its rapid growth. Can tolerate poorer soils but with reduced vigor.
