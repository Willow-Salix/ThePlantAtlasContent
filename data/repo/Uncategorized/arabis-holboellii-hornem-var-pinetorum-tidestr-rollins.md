## 🧤 Care Instructions
Holboell's Rockcress is a resilient plant adapted to the dry, rocky conditions of Western North American montane environments. It requires ample sunlight and excellent drainage, thriving with minimal water and lean soil. This makes it an ideal, low-maintenance choice for xeriscaping or rock gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all, is generally sufficient.
