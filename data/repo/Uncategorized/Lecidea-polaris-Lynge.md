## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Northern Lecidea Lichen, mimic its native harsh, exposed environment. Provide bright, direct light and allow for infrequent, thorough wetting followed by complete drying out. Do not fertilize, as it absorbs nutrients directly from its surroundings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None required. As a lichen, it obtains all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere (e.g., dust, precipitation) and the surface of its substrate, not from traditional soil fertilization.
