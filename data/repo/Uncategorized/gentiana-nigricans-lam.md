## 🌱 Overview
Gentiana () is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the gentian family (Gentianaceae), the tribe Gentianeae, and the monophyletic subtribe Gentianinae. With over 300 species, it is considered a large genus. Gentians are notable for their mostly large trumpet-shaped flowers, which are often of an intense blue hue, though some are also bright yellow. The type species of the genus is Gentiana lutea.
The genus name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king who may have discovered tonic properties in gentians.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native temperate meadow habitat. Moderate watering is crucial, allowing some surface drying between sessions while avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize sparingly to encourage robust growth without sacrificing blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is usually sufficient. Avoid heavy feeding as it can reduce flowering.
