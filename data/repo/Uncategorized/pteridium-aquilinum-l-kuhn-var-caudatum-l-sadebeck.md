## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly the Americas (North, Central, South America, Caribbean). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical and Tropical Dry/Moist Forests, open woodlands, clearings, and disturbed areas, often with seasonal rainfall. |
| **☀️ Light** | Highly adaptable, tolerating full sun to partial shade. Prefers bright indirect to direct sun for robust growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, to maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil. Tolerates some drought once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bracken (Pteridium) is a genus of large, cosmopolitan, coarse ferns in the family Dennstaedtiaceae. Ferns (Pteridophyta) are vascular plants that undergo alternation of generations, having both large plants (sporophytes) that produce spores and small plants (gametophytes) that produce sex cells (eggs and sperm) in its life cycle. Brackens are noted for their large, highly divided leaves. They are found on all continents except Antarctica, though their typical habitat is moorland.  The genus probably has the widest distribution of any fern in the world. 
The word bracken is of Old Norse origin, related to Swedish bräken and Danish bregne, both meaning fern. In the past, the genus was commonly treated as having only one species, Pteridium aquilinum, but the recent trend is to subdivide it into about ten species.
Like other ferns, brackens do not have seeds or fruit, but reproduce by spores. The immature fronds, known as fiddleheads, are sometimes eaten, although some are thought to be carcinogenic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable fern thrives in a range of light conditions from full sun to partial shade, preferring bright light. It requires regular watering to keep the soil consistently moist but well-drained, tolerating some drought. Fertilizer needs are minimal, as it is efficient in nutrient uptake.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly (once or twice during the growing season) with a diluted balanced liquid fertilizer, as it can thrive in nutrient-poor soils.
