## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-Arid Montane Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours direct sunlight daily) to partial sun, as it naturally grows in open, exposed rocky slopes and grasslands. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent and deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established due to its adaptation to semi-arid conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mountain Muhly is a resilient, low-maintenance grass that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its semi-arid montane origins. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry thoroughly, and it requires minimal fertilization, making it ideal for xeriscaping or dry garden areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to minimal. Soils in its native habitat are often lean and rocky; therefore, heavy fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental. A light, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring, if at all, is sufficient.
