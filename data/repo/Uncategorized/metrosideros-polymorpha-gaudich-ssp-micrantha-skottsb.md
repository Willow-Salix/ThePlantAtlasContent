## 🌱 Overview
Metrosideros (; MET-roe-SID-uh-ruhs) is a genus of approximately 60 trees, shrubs, and vines in the family Myrtaceae, mostly found in the Pacific region. Most of the tree forms are small, but some are exceptionally large, the New Zealand species in particular. The name derives from the Ancient Greek metra or "heartwood" and sideron or "iron". Perhaps the best-known species are the pōhutukawa (M. excelsa), northern rātā (M. robusta) and southern rātā (M. umbellata) of New Zealand, and ʻōhiʻa lehua (M. polymorpha) from the Hawaiian Islands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable Hawaiian native thrives in bright indirect to full sun and requires consistent moisture in well-draining soil. It benefits from light fertilization during its active growing season and is generally resilient to a range of environmental conditions once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer, particularly during active growth periods.
