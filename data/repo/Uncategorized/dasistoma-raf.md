## 🌱 Overview
Dasistoma macrophylla, commonly known as mullein foxglove, is a species of flowering plant in the broomrape family. It is monotypic, with no other species in the genus Dasistoma.
Dasistoma is native to the eastern United States, where its range is almost exclusively west of the Appalachian Mountains. Its natural habitat is in dry or dry-mesic woodlands and bluffs, typically on calcareous substrates. It is a moderately conservative species, not being found in highly ecologically disturbed habitats.
Dasistoma is a tall hemiparasitic forb growing to around six feet high. It is short lived, typically an annual or biennial although occasionally perennial. It produces tubular yellow flowers in the summer.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dasistoma thrives in conditions similar to its native temperate woodland, preferring partial to full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide regular watering to maintain soil moisture and support growth with an annual light fertilization or compost application in spring.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderately rich, well-draining soil; an annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is generally sufficient.
