## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen requires high light exposure, mimicking its natural habitat on exposed rock faces in dry, sunny environments. It is highly drought-tolerant, relying on natural rainfall and humidity for moisture. No conventional fertilization is needed, as it gathers nutrients from its environment and substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required; obtains nutrients from airborne particles and minerals within its rock substrate.
