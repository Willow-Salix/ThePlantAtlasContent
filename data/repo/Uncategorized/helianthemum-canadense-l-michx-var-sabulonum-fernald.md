## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and dry, sandy conditions, reflecting its native habitat in temperate sandy barrens. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny spots.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
