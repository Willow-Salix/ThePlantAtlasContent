## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Leonard's Beardtongue thrives in full sun and requires well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native montane shrubland environment. Water moderately during its growing season, ensuring soil dries out between applications, and avoid heavy fertilization to promote healthy growth and flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to poor soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental. A very light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring, or none at all, is generally sufficient.
