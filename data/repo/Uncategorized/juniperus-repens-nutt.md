## 🧤 Care Instructions
Creeping Juniper thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native habitat on open, rocky, or sandy sites. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; generally does not require much fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient for young plants if growth is slow, but established plants rarely need it.
