## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (specifically Arizona and New Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Highland/Montane Temperate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, typically thriving in open meadows or along forest edges with good light exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native habitat where it receives regular moisture from rainfall and snowmelt. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ranunculus  is a large genus of about 1750 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Members of the genus are known as buttercups, spearworts and water crowfoots.
The genus is distributed worldwide, primarily in temperate and montane regions. The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, which has extremely tough and tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much taller meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris. In ornamental  gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.
Buttercups usually flower in the spring, but flowers may be found throughout the summer, especially where the plants are growing as opportunistic colonizers, as in the case of garden weeds.
The water crowfoots (Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium), which grow in still or running water, are sometimes treated in a separate genus Batrachium (from Greek βάτραχος bátrakhos, "frog"). They have two different leaf types, thread-like leaves underwater and broader floating leaves. In some species, such as R. aquatilis, a third, intermediate leaf type occurs.
Ranunculus species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Hebrew character and small angle shades. Some species are popular ornamental flowers in horticulture, with many cultivars selected for large and brightly coloured flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Arizona Buttercup thrives in conditions similar to its native highland temperate environment, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide light to moderate fertilization during its active growth period for optimal health and flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season. Benefits from organically rich soil.
