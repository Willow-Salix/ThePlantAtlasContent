## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical Asia (e.g., China, India, Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines) and Northern Australia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests, Grasslands, and Savannas (often found in open areas, forest margins, and disturbed sites). |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers partial sun to full sun. It thrives with several hours of direct sunlight, especially in morning, and can tolerate full sun exposure in many tropical settings. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, particularly during warm growing seasons. Water regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Tolerant of short dry periods once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. Species are distributed widely – from Quebec to northern Argentina in the Americas, across northern and southern tropical Africa, in the southern Arabian Peninsula, in Myanmar and Thailand, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Desmodium polycarpon is a resilient plant from tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in partial to full sun exposure. It prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil and tolerates short dry spells. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it has low to moderate fertilizer needs, making it a relatively easy-to-care-for groundcover or border plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil and doesn't require heavy fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer diluted monthly during the growing season, or a slow-release granular fertilizer once a season, is sufficient.
