## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Dwarf Marsh Violet thrives in conditions mimicking its native cool temperate to subarctic boggy habitats. Provide consistently moist to wet, acidic soil and partial shade to partial sun. Avoid intense direct sun and over-fertilization to ensure optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Native bog soils can be naturally low in nutrients; over-fertilization should be avoided. A very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring, if at all.
