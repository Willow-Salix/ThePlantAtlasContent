## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide this plant with full sun to partial shade and ensure well-draining soil. Water regularly during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and reduce watering in cooler months. Fertilize lightly once or twice a year during the growing season.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient. Apply a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season, as it tolerates poorer soils.
