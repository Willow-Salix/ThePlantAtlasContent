## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Iberian Peninsula (Spain, Portugal) and wider Mediterranean region |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Arid Scrubland / Sclerophyllous Shrubland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential to mimic its open, sunny native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth (typically cooler months), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal water during hot, dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cytisus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae, native to open sites (typically scrub and heathland) in Europe, western Asia and North Africa. It belongs to the subfamily Faboideae, and is one of several genera in the tribe Genisteae which are commonly called brooms. They are shrubs producing masses of brightly coloured, pea-like flowers, often highly fragrant. Members of the segregate genera Calicotome, Chamaecytisus, and Lembotropis are sometimes included in Cytisus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its Mediterranean origins. Water moderately during active growth, allowing for dry periods, as it is drought-tolerant once established. Minimal fertilization is typically required for healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. As a leguminous plant, Cytisus species often fix nitrogen, thriving in lean to moderately fertile soils. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring is sufficient only if growth appears poor.
