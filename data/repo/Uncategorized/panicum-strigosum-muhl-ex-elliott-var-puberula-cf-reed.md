## 🧤 Care Instructions
This southeastern US native thrives in full to partial sun and well-drained, sandy soils, characteristic of its humid subtropical origin. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and has low fertilizer needs. It is a resilient grass well-suited to conditions mimicking its open, often disturbed, natural environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils typical of its native pineland habitats. A light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring, if any, is sufficient.
