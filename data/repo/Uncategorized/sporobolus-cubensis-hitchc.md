## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Cuba, southeastern United States (Florida), and parts of Central and South America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands and Savannas |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), consistent with its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate; water regularly during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. It is tolerant of short dry periods, reflecting its adaptation to distinct wet and dry seasons. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sporobolus is a nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. The name Sporobolus means "seed-thrower", and is derived from Ancient Greek word σπόρος (spóros), meaning "seed", and the root of βάλλειν (bállein) "to throw", referring to the dispersion of seeds. Members of the genus are usually called dropseeds or sacaton grasses. They are typical prairie and savanna plants, occurring in other types of open habitat in warmer climates. At least one species (S. caespitosus from Saint Helena) is threatened with extinction, and another (S. durus from Ascension Island) is extinct.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cuban Dropseed thrives in full sun, mirroring its native open grassland and savanna environments. It prefers moderate watering, with soil allowed to dry slightly between waterings, and has very low fertilizer requirements, adapting well to naturally poorer soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; generally requires minimal to no fertilization. If growing in very poor soil or for optimal vigor, a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season.
