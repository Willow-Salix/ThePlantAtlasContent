## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Pine Lily thrives in conditions mirroring its native humid subtropical prairies. Provide full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil during its growth period. Fertilize moderately to encourage robust blooming, and reduce water when dormant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a diluted liquid feed during its active growth phase (spring to early summer).
