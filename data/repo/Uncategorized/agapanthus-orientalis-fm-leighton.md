## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South Africa (specifically Cape Province and KwaZulu-Natal) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it is exposed to significant sunlight in open grasslands and coastal areas, so it thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sun for best flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the growing season (spring through summer), allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Given its native Mediterranean climate with dry summers, it is drought-tolerant once established but benefits from consistent moisture during active growth. Reduce watering significantly in winter. |

## 🌱 Overview
African lily is a common name for several plants and may refer to:

Agapanthus africanus, native of the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa.
Agapanthus praecox, also native to the Cape of Good Hope, and Natal Province in South Africa.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The African Lily, hailing from South Africa's Mediterranean climate, thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering during its spring and summer growing season, becoming quite drought-tolerant once established. It benefits from a light spring fertilization to encourage its characteristic vibrant blooms, with minimal care needed during its winter dormancy.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring to support flowering. Native soils in these regions are not excessively rich, so heavy fertilization is unnecessary and can lead to more foliage than flowers.
