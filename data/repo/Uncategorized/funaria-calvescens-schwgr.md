## 🌱 Overview
Funaria is a genus of approximately 210 species of moss. Funaria hygrometrica is the most common species. Funaria hygrometrica is called “cord moss” because of the twisted seta which is very hygroscopic and untwists when moist. The name is derived from the Latin word “funis”, meaning "a rope". In funaria root like structures called rhizoids are present.
Capsules are abundant with the moss surviving as spore when conditions are not suitable.
Moss plant Funaria grows in dense patches or cushions in moist shady and cool places on rocks, walls or crevices during the rainy seasons. It has a height of 3–5 cm, a radial symmetry with a differentiation of an axis or stem, leaves or phylloids are multicellular colorless branched rhizoids with oblique septa.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Funaria calvescens thrives in consistently moist, disturbed soil under full sun to partial shade. As a pioneer species, it requires minimal fertilization. Ensure good humidity and avoid complete desiccation to maintain healthy growth and encourage establishment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. If grown in pots, a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season is sufficient. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
