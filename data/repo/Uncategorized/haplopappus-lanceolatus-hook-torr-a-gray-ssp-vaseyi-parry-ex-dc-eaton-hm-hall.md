## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine/Subalpine Tundra and Montane Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to high-altitude, open exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between sessions; drought-tolerant once established, reflecting periods of snowmelt followed by drier conditions in its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Haplopappus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae found in South America, mostly restricted to the dry regions of the Southern Andes, Chilean Matorral, and Patagonia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This high-altitude plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out, and requires very little to no fertilization. Mimicking its native alpine environment with rocky, lean soil is key for successful cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky mountain soils; if necessary, a very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
