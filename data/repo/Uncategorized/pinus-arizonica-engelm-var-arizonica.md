### *Pinus arizonica Engelm. var. arizonica*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico (USA), and northern Mexico (Sierra Madre Occidental) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane Coniferous Forest / Pine-Oak Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), replicating its exposed mountain habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. While drought-tolerant once established, it benefits from deep, infrequent watering during prolonged dry periods, particularly when young. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pinus arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona pine, is a medium-sized pine in northern Mexico, southeast Arizona, southwest New Mexico, and western Texas in the United States. It is a tree growing to 25–35 m tall, with a trunk diameter of up to 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in). The needles are in bundles of 3, 4, or 5, with 5-needle fascicles being the most prevalent. This variability may be a sign of hybridization with the closely related ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). The cones are single, paired, or in whorls of three, and 5–11 cm long.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Arizona Pine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native montane habitat. It is drought-tolerant once established but benefits from moderate, deep watering during dry spells, especially when young. Minimal fertilization is typically needed for mature, healthy trees.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Established trees in suitable soil generally require little to no fertilization. A balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring for young trees or those in nutrient-poor soils.
