## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Coastal Plains of states like Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Biome: Pine Barrens and Open Woodlands) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, as it naturally occurs in open, exposed habitats within pine barrens and sandy areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; prefers consistently moist but well-draining soil, typical of its humid native climate with sandy soils that drain quickly. Tolerates some periods of drought once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Crotalaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae (subfamily Faboideae) commonly known as rattlepods. The genus includes over 700 species of herbaceous plants and shrubs. Africa is the continent with the majority of Crotalaria species (approximately 400 species), which are mainly found in damp grassland, especially in floodplains, depressions and along edges of swamps and rivers, but also in deciduous bush land, roadsides and fields. Some species of Crotalaria are grown as ornamentals. The common name rattlepod or rattlebox is derived from the fact that the seeds become loose in the pod as they mature, and rattle when the pod is shaken. The name derives from the Ancient Greek κρόταλον, meaning "castanet", and is the same root as the name for the rattlesnakes (Crotalus).
Crotalaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Endoclita sericeus, Etiella zinckenella and Utetheisa ornatrix. The toxic alkaloids produced by some members of this genus are known to be incorporated by Utetheisia larvae and used to secure their defense from predators.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full to partial sun with well-draining, sandy soil, reflecting its native habitat in southeastern U.S. pine barrens. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and fertilize sparingly as it is adapted to low-nutrient conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Supplemental fertilization is generally not required; a very light, balanced fertilizer application might be beneficial if grown in exceptionally poor potting mixes.
