## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Amazon Basin, encompassing regions of Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and the Guianas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers bright, indirect light. Young plants thrive in dappled light, while mature trees can tolerate more direct sun if gradually acclimated. Avoid intense, prolonged direct afternoon sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture, reflecting its high-rainfall native environment. Water thoroughly when the top inch or two of soil feels dry, ensuring good drainage to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Do not let the soil dry out completely for extended periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hevea brasiliensis, the Pará rubber tree, sharinga tree, seringueira, or most commonly, rubber tree or rubber plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, originally native to the Amazon basin, but is now pantropical in distribution due to introductions. It is the most economically important member of the genus Hevea because the milky latex extracted from the tree is the primary source of natural rubber.
