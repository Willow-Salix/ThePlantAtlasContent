| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Wetlands and Moist Grasslands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. This plant thrives in open, exposed areas typical of meadows and disturbed ground. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist to wet. Mimic its natural habitat of high soil moisture; it does not tolerate dry conditions well and may even thrive in standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Juncus tenuis, the slender rush, is a clump-forming, round-stemmed perennial in the Juncaceae (rush family).  Slender rush grows to be between 15 and 60 cm tall.  Generally considered a weed, it is rarely sold by retailers as a household container plant. Where it is introduced, it is colloquially called path rush, field rush, slender yard rush, poverty rush or wiregrass.
The leaves of the plant all come from the base and are not nearly as tall as the stems.  The stems are partly covered by sheaths, and have the most distinctive characteristic of the plant on them: clusters or cymes at the top.  These cymes consist of branches that have small egg-shaped seed capsules at the end of them.  The seeds split into three parts when they become ripe. The plant also spreads via rhizomatous root growth.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Path Rush requires full sun to partial shade and consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native wetland environments. Focus on providing ample water and a stable, temperate climate rather than extensive fertilization for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the active growing season, but rich soil is not a primary requirement.
