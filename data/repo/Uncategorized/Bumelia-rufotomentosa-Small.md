## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its native scrubland habitat. Provide infrequent but deep watering, allowing the soil to dry completely, and fertilize sparingly as it's adapted to poor nutrient conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
