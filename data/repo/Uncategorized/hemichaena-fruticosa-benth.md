## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hemichaena fruticosa thrives in conditions mimicking its native cloud forest habitat. Provide bright, indirect light and consistent moisture, ensuring good drainage. Maintain high humidity and offer regular, diluted fertilization during its active growth period for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength, every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during the cooler, darker months.
