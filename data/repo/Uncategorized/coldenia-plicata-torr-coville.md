## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah) and Northern Mexico (Baja California, Sonora) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Desert Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, thriving in direct and intense light exposure typical of open desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low; highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking sporadic desert rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Coldenia, named after C. Colden, is a monotypic genus of flowering plants traditionally included in the borage family, Boraginaceae sensu lato. It was assigned to the subfamily Ehretioideae, but molecular data revealed it to be more closely related to the genus Cordia, so that other authors placed in Cordioideae. Subsequently, it was placed in its own family, Coldeniaceae, within the Boraginales order, by the Boraginales Working Group.
The sole species is Coldenia procumbens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Foldleaf Coldenia demands full sun and exceptionally well-draining soil to mimic its arid desert habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal and infrequent watering, and thrives without significant fertilization due to its adaptation to poor soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None to very low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils and does not require regular fertilization.
