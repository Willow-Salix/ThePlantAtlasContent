## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Humid temperate and subtropical forest regions across North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Southeastern US), Europe (especially Atlantic regions), and parts of Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate to Subtropical Forests, often found in old-growth or mature forest ecosystems. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate indirect light. As an epiphyte or saxicole (growing on rock) typically found in the sheltered understories of forests, it requires significant shade and protection from direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely high ambient humidity is critical. Requires frequent exposure to moisture from misting, dew, or consistent rainfall; ideal in a humid terrarium or enclosed environment. Avoid prolonged periods of complete dryness, ensuring periodic rehydration. |

## 🌱 Overview
Collema (jelly lichen) is a genus of lichens in the family Collemataceae. The photobiont is the cyanobacterium genus Nostoc. Species in this genus typically grow on nutrient-rich bark or somewhat siliceous or calcareous rocks in humid environments.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This unique lichen thrives in environments mimicking its native forest understory, demanding extremely high humidity and low to moderate indirect light. Regular misting or placement in a consistently humid, enclosed setup is essential for its survival, while direct sunlight must be strictly avoided. No fertilizer is required, as it obtains nutrients naturally from its environment, and added chemicals can be harmful.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate; conventional fertilizers are not only unnecessary but can be detrimental to their delicate symbiotic structure.
