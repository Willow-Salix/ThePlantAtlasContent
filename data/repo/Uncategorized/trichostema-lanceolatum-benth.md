## 🌱 Overview
Trichostema lanceolatum, with the common names vinegarweed and camphor weed, is an annual flowering herb of the mint family native to western North America.
The common name 'vinegarweed' originated due to its foliage containing volatile oils that have a strong vinegar odor.  The oils have phytotoxic properties, which help the plant compete by killing or injuring other plant species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Vinegarweed thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its Mediterranean scrubland origins. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, especially after establishment. Fertilization needs are minimal, suitable for lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
