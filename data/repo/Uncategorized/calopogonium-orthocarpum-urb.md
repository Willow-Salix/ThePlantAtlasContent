## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical legume thrives in warm, humid conditions with ample sunlight to partial shade. Provide consistent moisture during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry slightly, and be mindful of its low nitrogen needs due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. It adapts well to various tropical soils, benefiting from phosphorus, potassium, and organic matter.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
