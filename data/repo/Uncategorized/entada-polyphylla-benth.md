## 🌱 Overview
Entada is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae, in the mimosoid clade of the subfamily Caesalpinioideae. It consists of some 30 species of trees, shrubs and tropical lianas. About 21 species are known from Africa, six from Asia, two from the American tropics and one with a pantropical distribution. They have compound leaves and produce exceptionally large seedpods of up to 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) long. Their seeds are buoyant and survive lengthy journeys via rivers and ocean currents, to eventually wash up on tropical beaches. According to Menninger the liana species of Entada can grow up to 30 m (98 ft) longer in eighteen months. According to Dr. Bruno Kremer of the University of Cologne, Entada spp. "beats all records for longitudinal growth" reaching lengths "between 300 and 400 metres (980 and 1,310 ft)".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical liana thrives in bright light conditions, from full sun to partial shade. It requires consistent moisture, mimicking its native rainforest environment, but with excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Regular feeding during its active growth period will support its vigorous development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season
