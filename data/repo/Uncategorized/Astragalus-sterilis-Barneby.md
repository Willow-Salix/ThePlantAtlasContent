## 🌱 Overview
Astragalus is a large genus of over 3,000 species of herbs and small shrubs, belonging to the legume family Fabaceae and the subfamily Faboideae. It is the largest genus of plants in terms of described species. The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Common names include milkvetch (most species), locoweed (in North America, some species) and goat's-thorn (A. gummifer, A. tragacantha). Some pale-flowered vetches (Vicia spp.) are similar in appearance, but they are more vine-like than Astragalus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soil, requiring infrequent watering due to its drought-tolerant nature. Mimic its arid habitat by providing ample light and allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between minimal waterings, with little to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer requirements; a dilute, balanced feed once in spring is sufficient, or none at all if grown in nutrient-poor, well-draining soil.
