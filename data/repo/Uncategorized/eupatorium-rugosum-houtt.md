## 🧤 Care Instructions
White Snakeroot thrives in conditions similar to its native temperate woodlands. Provide partial to full shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It generally requires low to moderate fertilization, benefiting most from organic soil amendments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Natural forest soils are enriched by decomposing organic matter; amending with compost or a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient.
