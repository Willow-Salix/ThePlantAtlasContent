## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and alpine regions of North America, particularly Alaska, Northwestern Canada, and the Rocky Mountains. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright, direct light for most of the day, but can benefit from some afternoon shade in hot climates to prevent scorching. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist but very well-drained soil. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry, ensuring it never sits in standing water, which mimics its rocky, snow-fed native environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in cool, bright conditions with excellent drainage. Provide full to partial sun and maintain consistently moist but never waterlogged soil. Minimal fertilization is needed for its best health and flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Native to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Apply a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer once a year in spring, or mix a small amount of compost into the soil annually. Over-fertilization can harm the plant.
