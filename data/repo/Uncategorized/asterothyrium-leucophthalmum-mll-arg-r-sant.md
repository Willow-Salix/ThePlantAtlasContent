## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical South America (e.g., Brazil) and Central America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low light; thrives in deep shade characteristic of the rainforest understory where it grows on leaves. Direct sunlight is highly detrimental. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires extremely high and consistent humidity (above 80-90%) with frequent atmospheric moisture. Relies on absorption of water directly from the air and rainfall, not soil. Regular misting or placement in a high-humidity environment (e.g., terrarium) is crucial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Asterothyrium is a genus of leaf-dwelling lichens in the family Gomphillaceae. These tiny lichens form small, star-shaped fruiting bodies on the surface of leaves in tropical and subtropical forests. They are most commonly found in humid, shaded environments where leaves remain moist and clean. The genus includes 19 recognised species distributed primarily throughout Central and South America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphyllous lichen demands a very stable, high-humidity environment with deep shade, mimicking its native tropical rainforest understory. Providing consistent atmospheric moisture is vital, while traditional fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful. Avoid any direct sunlight.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers. As a lichen, it obtains nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, dissolved minerals in rain) and organic particles on its substrate. Focus should be on maintaining optimal humidity and air quality rather than fertilization.
