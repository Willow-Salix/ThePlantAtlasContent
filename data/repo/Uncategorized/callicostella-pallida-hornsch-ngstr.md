# Pale Callicostella Moss
### *Callicostella pallida (Hornsch.) Ã…ngstr.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical America, particularly Central and South America (e.g., Brazil) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low light; prefers deep shade. Mimics the forest floor under dense canopy, avoiding any direct sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires constant moisture and extremely high ambient humidity. Keep the substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged. Daily misting or placement in a terrarium/paludarium is crucial. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pale Callicostella Moss thrives in conditions that replicate its tropical rainforest understory habitat. Provide very low light, ensure extremely high humidity, and maintain consistently moist (but not waterlogged) conditions to prevent drying out. Fertilization is rarely needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low. Fertilization is generally unnecessary for mosses. If desired, a highly diluted (1/8 to 1/10 strength) liquid fertilizer can be applied very sparingly (once every few months).
