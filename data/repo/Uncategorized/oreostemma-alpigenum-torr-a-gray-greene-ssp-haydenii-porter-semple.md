## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in conditions mimicking its high-altitude native habitat. Provide full sun exposure and moderate, consistent watering while ensuring excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilization. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky alpine soils, so over-fertilizing can be detrimental.
