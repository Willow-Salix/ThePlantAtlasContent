## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Narrowpod Sensitive Pea thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical savanna environment, requiring abundant sunlight and consistent moisture during its active growing phase. As a legume, it benefits from lighter fertilization, especially avoiding high nitrogen, and prefers a well-draining soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced or lower-nitrogen formula, as this legume may fix its own nitrogen.
