## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Alpine False Goldenaster, provide abundant full sun and well-draining soil to mimic its native alpine environment. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing to maintain its compact growth and vibrant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to lean, rocky alpine soils and does not require heavy fertilization. Excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
