## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in consistently cool, humid conditions with bright, indirect light, mimicking its native arctic and alpine environments. It absorbs moisture from the air and requires no traditional fertilization, being highly sensitive to excess nutrients. Ensure periods of dryness between rehydration to prevent fungal issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require conventional fertilizers and is highly sensitive to excess nutrients. It obtains necessary nutrients from the air and its substrate.
