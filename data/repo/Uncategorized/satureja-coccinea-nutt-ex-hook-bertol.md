## 🌱 Overview
Satureja is a genus of aromatic plants of the family Lamiaceae, related to rosemary and thyme. It is native to southern and southeastern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. Historically, Satureja was defined broadly and many species of the subtribe Menthinae from throughout the world were included in it. In the modern cladistic era of botany, Satureja was redefined to a narrower monophyletic genus whose species are all native to Eurasia. Several species are cultivated as culinary herbs called savory, and they have become established in the wild in a few places.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Scarlet Savory thrives in bright conditions, from full sun to partial shade, and prefers well-draining, sandy soil that is kept consistently moist but not waterlogged. It has low to moderate fertilizer needs, mimicking its native habitat in the humid subtropical pine flatwoods of the southeastern United States.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, especially in poorer soils.
