## 🌱 Overview
Cereus repandus (syn. Cereus peruvianus), the Peruvian apple cactus, is a large, erect, spiny columnar cactus found in South America. It is also known as giant club cactus, hedge cactus, cadushi (in Papiamento and Wayuunaiki), and kayush.
Cereus repandus is grown mostly as an ornamental plant, but has some local culinary importance. The Wayuu from the La Guajira Peninsula of Colombia and Venezuela also use the inner cane-like wood of the plant in wattle and daub construction.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cactus thrives in environments mimicking its native subtropical dry forest and scrubland, requiring abundant sunlight and well-draining soil. It is very drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering, especially during its dormant winter phase. Fertilize sparingly during the growing season for best results.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced, diluted cactus fertilizer once a month during the growing season. No fertilizer needed during winter.
