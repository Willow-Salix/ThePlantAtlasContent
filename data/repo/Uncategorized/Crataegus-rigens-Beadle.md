## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Gadsden Hawthorn thrives in humid subtropical environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires regular watering to keep the soil moist, though mature plants can tolerate some drought. Fertilizer is typically not heavily required, with light annual feeding sufficient for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, particularly in poor soils.
