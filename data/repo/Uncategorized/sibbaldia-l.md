| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including arctic and alpine zones of Europe, Asia, and North America (e.g., Alps, Himalayas, Rockies) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in high light exposure typical of treeless alpine and arctic environments, but also tolerates some shade in higher altitudes. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate. Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging, mimicking conditions of melting snow and well-drained rocky soils. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sibbaldia thrives in bright, cool conditions with consistently moist yet very well-drained soil, replicating its native alpine and arctic tundra environments. It requires minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils. Ensure it receives ample light and protection from excessive heat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal. Native soils are generally nutrient-poor; excessive fertilization can harm the plant. A very dilute, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, if at all.
