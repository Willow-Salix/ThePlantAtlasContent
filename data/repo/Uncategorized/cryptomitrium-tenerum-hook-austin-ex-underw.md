| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest Understory (Humid Temperate) |
| **☀️ Light** | Low light; thrives in deep shade or indirect, filtered light. Avoid any direct sunlight as it can scorch the plant. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged. Requires high humidity; regular misting or placement in a terrarium is highly beneficial to mimic its natural environment. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cryptomitrium tenerum thrives in consistently moist, highly humid, and deeply shaded environments, typical of a forest understory. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent rot while maintaining substrate dampness and high ambient humidity. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its primitive nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required. If necessary, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/10th strength) can be applied very sparingly once or twice a year during active growth.
