## 🌱 Overview
Erysimum, or wallflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the cabbage family, Brassicaceae. It includes more than 150 species, both popular garden plants and many wild forms. Erysimum is characterised by star-shaped (and/or two-sided) trichomes growing from the stem, with yellow, red, pink or orange flowers and multiseeded seed pods.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in its native Mediterranean scrubland, the Santa Cruz wallflower requires full sun and excellent drainage. Water sparingly once established, primarily during the cooler months, and avoid over-fertilization, as it prefers lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, if needed, but thrives in leaner soils.
