## 🌱 Overview
Chenopodium is a genus of numerous species of perennial or annual herbaceous flowering plants known as the goosefoot, which occur almost anywhere in the world. It is placed in the family Amaranthaceae in the APG II system; older classification systems, notably the widely used Cronquist system, separate it and its relatives as Chenopodiaceae, but this leaves the rest of the Amaranthaceae polyphyletic. However, among the Amaranthaceae, the genus Chenopodium is the namesake member of the subfamily Chenopodioideae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wolf's Goosefoot is a hardy plant native to sunny, dry montane regions, requiring full sun exposure and minimal water. It prefers well-draining, poor soils and thrives without the need for rich fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage and infrequent watering to mimic its arid native habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to lean, nutrient-poor, sandy or gravelly soils. Does not require rich fertilization and may be harmed by excessive nutrients.
