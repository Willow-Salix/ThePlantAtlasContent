| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States, primarily California, Oregon, and Nevada |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun but can tolerate partial shade, especially in hotter inland areas, mimicking its natural habitat on woodland edges and open slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate watering during its active growth phase in spring, reflecting the native wet winters/springs. Once established, it becomes drought-tolerant and needs minimal to no supplemental water during dry summer months. |

## 🌱 Overview
The genus Scrophularia of the family Scrophulariaceae comprises about 200 species of herbaceous flowering plants commonly known as figworts. Species of Scrophularia all share square stems, opposite leaves and open two-lipped flowers forming clusters at the end of their stems. The genus is found throughout the Northern Hemisphere.
Scrophularia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Phymatopus hectoides.
Some species in this genus are known to contain potentially useful substances, such as iridoids, and several Scrophularia species, such as the Ningpo figwort (S. ningpoensis), have been used by herbal medicine practitioners around the world. The name Scrophularia comes from scrofula, a form of tuberculosis, because several species have been used in herbal medicine for this disease.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
California Figwort thrives in a Mediterranean climate, preferring full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. It requires moderate watering during its spring growth, becoming quite drought-tolerant in summer. Fertilization needs are generally low.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Naturally grows in soils that are not overly rich. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in early spring can support vigorous growth but is often not strictly necessary.
