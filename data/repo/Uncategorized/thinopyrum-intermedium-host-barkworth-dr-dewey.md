## 🌱 Overview
Thinopyrum intermedium, known commonly as intermediate wheatgrass, is a sod-forming perennial grass in the Triticeae tribe of Pooideae native to Europe and Western Asia. It is part of a group of plants commonly called wheatgrasses because of the similarity of their seed heads or ears to common wheat. However, wheatgrasses generally are perennial, while wheat is an annual.
Trials with intermediate wheatgrass, the product of which is trademarked by the Land Institute as "Kernza", show that it can be grown as a "multi-functional" crop, yielding various commodities as well as ecosystem services.  Whereas annuals such as corn tend to deplete soil organic matter and require inputs, a perennial grain such as intermediate wheatgrass can yield crops while building soil organic matter.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Intermediate Wheatgrass is a robust perennial grass that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, reflecting its origins in open steppes. It requires moderate watering during establishment but becomes highly drought-tolerant and low-maintenance once mature, needing minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer in spring if soil is poor or for optimal vigor.
