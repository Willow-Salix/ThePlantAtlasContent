## 🧤 Care Instructions
Newcombe's Ragwort thrives in bright conditions, from full to partial sun, in consistently moist yet well-drained soil. Mimicking its high-elevation native environment, it requires adequate hydration without waterlogging and benefits from low to moderate fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring is generally sufficient, as alpine soils are often not highly fertile.
