## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wiggins' Lupine thrives in its native Western North American temperate montane and Mediterranean-like environments. It prefers full to partial sun exposure and well-drained soil, being drought-tolerant once established. This plant requires moderate watering during its growing season and minimal to no fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a nitrogen-fixing plant, avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. An annual application of balanced, low-concentration fertilizer or compost may be beneficial in very poor soils.
