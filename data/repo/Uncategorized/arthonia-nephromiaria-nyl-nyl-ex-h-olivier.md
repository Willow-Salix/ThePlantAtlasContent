## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western Europe (e.g., UK, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal), Macaronesia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Oceanic (hyperoceanic), characterized by high humidity, mild temperatures, and frequent rainfall in ancient woodlands. |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect light to partial shade. Requires shelter from direct, intense sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | This is a lichen, not a plant. It thrives in high atmospheric humidity and occasional rainfall, absorbing moisture directly from the air and surface. Avoid standing water; misting or a humid environment is preferred over traditional 'watering'. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arthonia is a genus of crustose lichens in the family Arthoniaceae. They are commonly called comma lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a lichen, Arthonia nephromiaria requires a consistently humid environment with indirect light, mimicking its natural habitat in moist, sheltered woodlands. Traditional watering and fertilizing are unnecessary, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and its substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens obtain nutrients primarily from atmospheric deposition (dust, rain). No traditional fertilizer is needed.
