## 🌱 Overview
Gourds include the fruits of some flowering plant species in the family Cucurbitaceae, particularly Cucurbita and Lagenaria. The term refers to a number of species and subspecies, many with hard shells, and some without. Many gourds have large, bulbous bodies and long necks, such as Dipper Gourds, many variations of Bottle Gourd and caveman club gourds. One of the earliest domesticated types of plants, subspecies of the bottle gourd, Lagenaria siceraria, have been discovered in archaeological sites dating from as early as 13,000 BC. Gourds have had numerous uses throughout history, including as tools, musical instruments, objects of art, film, and food.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cucurbita plants, originating from warm subtropical to tropical regions, thrive in full sun and demand consistent moisture. They are heavy feeders and require rich soil and regular fertilization to support their vigorous growth and prolific fruit production.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Cucurbita are heavy feeders, requiring rich, fertile, well-draining soil. Regular fertilization with a balanced NPK formula, or one higher in phosphorus and potassium during flowering and fruiting, is essential.
