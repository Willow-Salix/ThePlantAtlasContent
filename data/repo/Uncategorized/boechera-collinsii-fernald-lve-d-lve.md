## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada (e.g., Maine, Vermont, New York, Ontario, Quebec) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate/Boreal Forest and Subalpine/Alpine zones |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, typical of exposed rocky habitats and open slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, consistent moisture with excellent drainage, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings to mimic its rocky, well-drained native environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Boechera (rockcress) is a genus of the family Brassicaceae. It was named after the Danish botanist Tyge W. Böcher (1909–1983), who was known for his research in alpine plants, including the mustards Draba and Boechera holboellii. According to recent molecular-based studies, Boechera is closely related to the genus Arabidopsis which also includes the widely known model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
Until recently, members of this genus were included in the genus Arabis, but have been separated from that genus based on recent genetic and cytological data. Unlike the genus Arabis (x=8) Boechera has a base chromosome number of x=7. Many taxa are triploid. Boechera is a primarily North American genus, most diverse in the western United States, and its distribution range also includes Greenland and the Russian Far East. The genus is poorly known, and species within are difficult to separate morphologically though some clearly distinct species are known.
Most members of the genus are perennial plants with pubescent leaves with stellate trichomes, narrow curving fruits, and small white to purple flowers in elongated racemes. Relationships within the genus are unclear, and some eastern North American species, including Boechera laevigata, may belong to a clade distinct from the rest of the genus.
A very interesting feature of many species of the genus is asexual reproduction, a process known as apomixis. Microsatellite data has revealed that some of the apomictic lineages are hybrids between two or more sexual parents.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Collins' Rockcress prefers full to partial sun, mimicking its native exposed rocky habitats. It requires moderate, consistent moisture but excellent drainage to thrive. Due to its natural adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, only low to moderate fertilizer is needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it naturally occurs in nutrient-poor rocky soils and does not require heavy fertilization.
