## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native arid steppe environment. It requires minimal watering, being highly drought-tolerant, and generally benefits from little to no fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities and adaptation to poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, and its native soils are typically lean. If necessary, a very light, balanced slow-release formula can be applied sparingly.
