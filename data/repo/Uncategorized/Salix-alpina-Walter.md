## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Southern Europe (Alps, Carpathians, Pyrenees) and parts of Asia, at high altitudes. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra/Subalpine zones. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in bright, open conditions typical of high-altitude environments, requiring good light exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist but very well-draining soil. Requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, mimicking snowmelt or frequent mountain rain. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Alpine Willow thrives in cool, bright conditions with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its high-altitude native habitat. It requires full to partial sun and protection from excessive heat. Minimal fertilization is generally needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor, rocky soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Adaptable to poor, rocky soils. A light, balanced fertilizer in early spring, or none if soil is naturally rich enough.
