## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Intermountain West region of the United States (e.g., Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, eastern Washington, northeastern California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Montane Scrubland / High Desert Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential to mimic its open, high-exposure native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Very infrequent watering; extremely drought-tolerant. Allow the soil to dry out completely and remain dry for extended periods between waterings. Overwatering is a common cause of failure. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant requires full sun and exceptionally well-draining soil, replicating its arid montane origins. Provide minimal water, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between waterings, and avoid rich soils or excessive fertilization to ensure its robust health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. This plant thrives in poor, lean, rocky, and well-draining soils, which are typical of its native environment. Rich soils or excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
