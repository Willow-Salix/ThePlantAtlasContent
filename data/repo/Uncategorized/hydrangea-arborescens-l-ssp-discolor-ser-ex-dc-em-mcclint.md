## 🌱 Overview
Hydrangea cinerea, the ashy hydrangea or gray hydrangea, is a small to medium sized, deciduous shrub up to 3 m (9.8 ft) tall; its natural range is interior regions of the southeastern United States.  Its common names reflect the ashy or gray appearance of the undersides of its leaves, which results from a dense pubescence.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hydrangea thrives in conditions mimicking its native forest understory: partial to full shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide moderate fertilization in spring to support lush growth, and ensure it's protected from intense afternoon sun to prevent stress and leaf scorch.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; benefit from a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring or a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season, especially in lean soils.
