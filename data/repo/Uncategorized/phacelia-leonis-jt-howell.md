## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern California, USA (Klamath Mountains and North Coast Ranges, specifically Siskiyou and Trinity counties) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland and Woodland (montane) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight, especially in cooler climates, and can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter regions. |
| **💧 Water** | Water moderately during its active growth period in spring, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is adapted to dry summer conditions and requires minimal to no watering during dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Phacelia (phacelia, scorpionweed, heliotrope) is a genus of about 200 species of annual or perennial herbaceous plants in the borage family, native to North and South America. California is particularly rich in species with over 90 recorded in the region.
The genus is traditionally placed at family rank with the waterleafs (Hydrophyllaceae) in the order Boraginales. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, recognizing that the traditional Boraginaceae and Hydrophyllaceae are paraphyletic with respect to each other, merges the latter into the former and considers the family basal in the Euasterids I clade. Other botanists continue to recognize the Hydrophyllaceae and Boraginales after analysing the secondary structure of the ITS1 genetic region rather than its sequence for these higher taxonomic levels.  This placed Phacelia within the Hydrophyllaceae. Further molecular taxonomic analysis of the Boraginales has divided the Boraginales in two and placed Phacelia among the monophyletic herbaceous Hydrophyllaceae in Boraginales II.
The genus includes both annual and perennial species. Many have been cultivated as garden and honey plants.
There are reports that glandular hairs of stems, flowers and leaves of some species of Phacelia secrete oil droplets that can cause an unpleasant skin rash (contact dermatitis) in some people, specifically from P. brachyloba, P. campanularia, P. crenulata, P. gina-glenneae, P. grandiflora, P. ixodes, P. minor, and P. pedicellata. The major contact allergen of P. crenulata has been identified as geranylhydroquinone and of P. minor as geranylgeranylhydroquinone.
The mining bee Andrena phaceliae is a specialist pollinator of this genus in the Eastern United States.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Siskiyou phacelia prefers full sun and extremely well-draining, nutrient-poor soil. Water sparingly during its spring growth, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization, as it is adapted to harsh, lean conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, often serpentine soils. Over-fertilization can be harmful. If necessary, use a very diluted, low-phosphorus fertilizer sparingly.
