## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah) and Northwestern Mexico (Baja California, Sonora) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, thriving in bright, direct light for most of the day, mimicking its open desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce significantly or cease watering during cooler, dormant periods (winter) to prevent rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native demands abundant direct sunlight and very infrequent watering, allowing its soil to thoroughly dry out before rewatering. Provide minimal fertilizer during its active growing phase to encourage healthy development, closely mimicking its natural arid environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; apply a diluted, low-nitrogen fertilizer specifically formulated for cacti once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
