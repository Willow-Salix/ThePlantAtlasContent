## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |

| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida and Georgia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Wetlands (Bogs, Pine Flatwoods, Savannas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun exposure |
| **💧 Water** | Soil must be kept consistently wet; thrives in standing water or bog-like conditions and should never be allowed to dry out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Harper's Beaksedge thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently wet, bog-like soil conditions, reflecting its native wetland habitat. It is well-adapted to nutrient-poor environments, making minimal fertilization necessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted, balanced formula only if growth appears weak.
