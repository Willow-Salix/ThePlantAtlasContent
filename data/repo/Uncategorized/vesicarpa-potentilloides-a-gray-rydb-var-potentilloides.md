## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant prefers full sun exposure and is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established. It thrives in well-draining soil and has low fertilizer needs, reflecting its origins in arid and rocky environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as native soils are often nutrient-poor. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring, but often not necessary.
