## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mimic its desert origin by providing abundant sunlight and very little water, especially during its dormant period to prevent rot. Ensure excellent drainage with a gritty soil mix, and offer minimal fertilization only during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; a balanced, dilute liquid fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer) but is often not strictly necessary.
