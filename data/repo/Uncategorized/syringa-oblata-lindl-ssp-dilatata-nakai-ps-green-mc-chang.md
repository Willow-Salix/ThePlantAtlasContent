Syringa is a genus of 12 currently recognized species of flowering woody plants in the olive family or Oleaceae called lilacs. These lilacs are native to woodland and scrub from southeastern Europe to eastern Asia, and widely and commonly cultivated in temperate areas elsewhere.
The genus is most closely related to Ligustrum (privet), classified with it in Oleaceae tribus Oleeae subtribus Ligustrinae.
Lilacs are used as food plants by the larvae of some moth species, including lilac leaf mining moth, privet hawk moth, copper underwing, scalloped oak and Svensson's copper underwing.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy shrub thrives in temperate climates, preferring full sun and well-drained soil with consistent moisture. Provide moderate watering, especially when establishing, but ensure good drainage to prevent root rot. Fertilize sparingly in early spring to encourage abundant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or compost in early spring. Avoid excessive nitrogen which can inhibit flowering.
