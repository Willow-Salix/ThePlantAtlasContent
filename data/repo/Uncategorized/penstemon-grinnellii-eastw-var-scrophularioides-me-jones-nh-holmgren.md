## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun with excellent drainage, mimicking its native Mediterranean montane habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal supplemental water. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is typically needed. These plants are adapted to lean, rocky soils and excessive nutrients can be harmful.
