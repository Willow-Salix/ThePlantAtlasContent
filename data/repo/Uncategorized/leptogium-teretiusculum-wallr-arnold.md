## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically, humid and often shaded understories) |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect to low light; prefers deeply shaded environments and is highly sensitive to direct sunlight which can cause desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and regular direct moisture from mist, dew, or rain, as it absorbs water directly from its environment and lacks roots. |

## 🌱 Overview
Leptogium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Collemataceae. It has about 110 species. Species formerly classified under Leptogium have since been divided among the genera Leptogium, Pseudoleptogium, and Scytinium. Leptogium lichens are predominantly found on tree bark or soil, often among mosses, and sometimes on rocks in moist environments.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen requires a consistently high humidity environment and very low, indirect light, mimicking its natural habitat on tree bark or mossy rocks in shaded temperate forests. Traditional watering and fertilization are not suitable, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere and is sensitive to pollutants.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens are sensitive to nutrient pollution and acquire all necessary nutrients from the air and precipitation, not through traditional soil fertilization.
