# Leptohymenium Moss
### *Leptohymenium SchwÃ¤gr.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Neotropics (Central and South America), particularly montane regions |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical/Subtropical Montane Cloud Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect, low to moderate light; avoid direct sunlight which can scorch the moss. |
| **💧 Water** | Maintain consistently moist conditions and very high humidity; frequent misting or a closed terrarium environment is ideal to mimic cloud forest moisture. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Leptohymenium moss thrives in environments that replicate its native montane cloud forest, requiring consistently moist conditions, very high humidity, and indirect, low to moderate light. Direct sunlight must be avoided. Its nutrient needs are very low, making minimal to no fertilization appropriate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required; these mosses have very low nutrient needs and can be harmed by excess nutrients. If necessary, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly.
