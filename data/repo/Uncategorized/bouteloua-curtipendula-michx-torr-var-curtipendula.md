## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sideoats Grama is a resilient prairie grass that thrives in full sun conditions. Once established, it requires very little water due to its drought tolerance and generally needs no fertilization, making it an excellent low-maintenance plant for various landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Generally not required, as it is adapted to nutrient cycling in prairie soils. Excessive fertilization can lead to weaker growth. If soil is extremely poor, a light, balanced fertilizer in early spring can be applied.
