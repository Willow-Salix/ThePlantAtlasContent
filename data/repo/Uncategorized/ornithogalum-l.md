## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Africa, Mediterranean Europe, Southwest Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean, Temperate Grasslands, Subtropical Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers bright light to promote flowering, similar to its open habitat in native regions. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during active growth and flowering (cooler, wetter seasons in its native climate), then reduce significantly or cease during summer dormancy (dry season) to prevent bulb rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
The Star of Bethlehem, or Christmas Star, appears in the nativity story of the Gospel of Matthew chapter 2 where "wise men from the East" (Magi) are inspired by the star to travel to Jerusalem. There, they meet King Herod of Judea, and ask him:

Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.
Herod calls together his scribes and priests who, quoting  a verse from the Book of Micah, interpret it as a prophecy that the Jewish Messiah would be born in Bethlehem to the south of Jerusalem. Secretly intending to find and kill the Messiah in order to preserve his own kingship, Herod invites the wise men to return to him on their way home.
The star leads them to Jesus' Bethlehem birthplace, where they worship him and give him gifts. The wise men are then given a divine warning not to return to Herod, so they return home by a different route.
Many Christians believe the star was a miraculous sign. Some theologians claimed that the star fulfilled a prophecy, known as the Star Prophecy. Astronomers have made several attempts to link the star to unusual celestial events, such as a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn or Jupiter and Venus, a comet, or a supernova. Some modern scholars do not consider the story to be describing a historical event, but rather a pious fiction added later to the main gospel account.
The subject is a favorite at planetarium shows during the Christmas season. However, most ancient sources and Church tradition generally indicate that the wise men visited Bethlehem sometime after Jesus' birth. The visit is traditionally celebrated on Epiphany (January 6) in Western Christianity.
The account in the Gospel of Matthew describes Jesus with the broader Greek word παιδίον, paidíon, which can mean either "infant" or "child" rather than the more specific word for infant, βρέφος, bréphos. This possibly implies that some time has passed since the birth. However, the word παιδίον, paidíon is also used in the Gospel of Luke specifically concerning Jesus' birth and his later presentation at the temple. Herod I has all male Hebrew babies in the area up to age two killed in the Massacre of the Innocents.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide a location with full sun to partial shade and ensure well-draining soil, mimicking its native open and often rocky habitats. Water consistently during its active growth period, typically in spring, but allow the soil to dry out and withhold water almost entirely during its summer dormancy to protect the bulbs. Fertilize sparingly during the growing phase to support robust flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced fertilizer during the active growing season, reflecting the varied but often not overly rich soils of its native range.
