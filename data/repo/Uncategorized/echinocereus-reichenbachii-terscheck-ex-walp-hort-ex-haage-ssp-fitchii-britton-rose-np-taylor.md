## 🌱 Overview
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fitch's hedgehog cactus, originating from arid scrublands, thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, allowing its well-draining soil to dry out thoroughly between sessions. It needs minimal fertilization during its spring and summer growing period. This plant is sensitive to overwatering and prefers a dry, warm environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal. A diluted, balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
