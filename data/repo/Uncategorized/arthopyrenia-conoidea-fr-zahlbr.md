## 🌱 Overview
Arthopyrenia is a genus of fungi in the family Trypetheliaceae. It was formerly classified in the eponymic family Arthopyreniaceae, but molecular phylogenetics studies showed that the type species, Arthopyrenia cerasi, was a member of the Trypetheliaceae. Arthopyrenia fungi typically form inconspicuous films embedded within tree bark and produce tiny, flask-shaped fruiting bodies covered by dark, shield-like caps. The genus includes both lichen-forming species (those that partner with algae) and non-lichenized species, with about 100 currently recognized species found primarily on bark and wood substrates.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in the humid, sheltered environments of temperate forests, typically growing on tree bark. It requires consistent high humidity and protection from direct sun, absorbing moisture and nutrients directly from the air and rainfall. No additional watering or fertilization is needed beyond its natural environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No additional fertilization is required; derives all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere and host substrate.
