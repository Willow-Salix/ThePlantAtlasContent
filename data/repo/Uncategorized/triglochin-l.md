| **🌍 Origin** | Worldwide, particularly temperate and cold regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, often in wetlands, marshes, fens, and saline shores. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Wetland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in open, unshaded conditions typical of marshes and fens. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently wet to saturated soil; requires boggy conditions or standing water, as it is intolerant of drying out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Triglochin is a plant genus in the family Juncaginaceae described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It includes 25 known species. It is very nearly cosmopolitan in distribution, with species on every continent except Antarctica. North America has four accepted species, two of which can also be found in Europe: Triglochin palustris (marsh arrowgrass) and Triglochin maritima (sea arrowgrass). Australia has many more.
The most widely used common name for the genus is arrowgrass, although these plants are not really grasses. Many of the common names for species make use of the term "arrowgrass", although there are exceptions: T. procera, for example, is commonly known as water ribbons.
Arrowgrasses are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the grey chi moth.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Arrowgrass demands constant moisture, preferring saturated soil or even standing water, and ample sunlight for optimal growth. It is well-suited to open wetland environments and adapted to low to moderate soil fertility, making it a low-maintenance plant if its specific water and light needs are met.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to the variable nutrient levels found in wetland soils, generally not requiring rich fertilization.
