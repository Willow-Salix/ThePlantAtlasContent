## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fleabane is a resilient plant best suited for full sun to partial shade, reflecting its native open habitat. It requires moderate watering, preferring well-drained soil, and is highly adaptable to average to poor soil conditions, thus needing very little to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. As many species are pioneer plants found in average to poor soils, heavy fertilization is not necessary and can even be detrimental. It thrives with minimal soil amendments.
