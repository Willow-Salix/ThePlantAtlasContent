### *Pyrenula microcarpa MÃ¼ll. Arg.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions globally, including parts of South America (e.g., Brazil), Central America, Southeast Asia, and Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect to dappled sunlight, mimicking the understory conditions of its native habitat. Avoid direct, intense sun exposure which can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high humidity and regular moisture. As an epiphyte, it absorbs water from rain and atmospheric moisture; misting or placement in a high-humidity environment (e.g., terrarium) is ideal. Do not 'water' like a soil-based plant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pyrenula is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Pyrenulaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in tropical regions, and contains about 200 species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for this wart lichen, maintain consistently high humidity and provide indirect to dappled sunlight, mimicking its native tropical rainforest habitat. Focus on atmospheric moisture through misting rather than direct watering to a substrate, and avoid all artificial fertilizers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No external fertilization is typically required or recommended. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from the air, rainwater, and their substrate; artificial fertilizers can be harmful.
