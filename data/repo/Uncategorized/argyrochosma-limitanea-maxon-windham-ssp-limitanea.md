## 🌱 Overview
Argyrochosma is a genus of ferns known commonly as false cloak ferns. The genus is included in the Cheilanthoideae subfamily of the Pteridaceae.  Species now in this genus were previously treated as members of related genera Notholaena or Pellaea but were segregated into their own genus in 1987.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This xeric fern requires excellent drainage and bright light, mimicking its native arid, rocky habitats. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to fully dry between applications, and fertilize very sparingly to ensure its healthy, drought-adapted growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. Feed sparingly, perhaps once or twice during the active growing season, with a highly diluted balanced liquid fertilizer.
