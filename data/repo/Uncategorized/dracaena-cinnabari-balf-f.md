## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Socotra Dragontree thrives in bright, direct light and requires minimal watering, adapting to its arid island origin. Ensure well-draining soil and very infrequent fertilization to prevent root rot and over-nutrition.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, during the growing season, as it naturally grows in poor, rocky soils.
