## 🌱 Overview
Machaeranthera is a genus of North American flowering plants in the family Asteraceae which are known by the common name tansyaster.
Tansyasters are variable in appearance. Some are small, singular wildflowers, while others are sprawling shrubs. Several species easily hybridize with each other, as well, making identification difficult. In general, members of the genus may be identified by the sharp-pointed, dagger-shaped anthers in the disc florets at the center of the flower. The flower heads are usually daisylike, and are usually a shade of purple or blue, but may be pink, yellow, or white. Tansyasters are native to western North America.
The genus Machaeranthera is distinguished from the genus Dieteria by having once- or twice-pinnate leaves, whereas Dieteria has entire to toothed leaves.
Machaeranthera means "swordlike anthers".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its arid native habitat in the Southwestern US and Northern Mexico. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal and infrequent watering, and performs best with lean soil and very little fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer needs; apply a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly, if at all, during the growing season.
