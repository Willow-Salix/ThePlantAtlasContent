| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Makua Valley, Waiʻanae Mountains, Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest/Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring several hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings; highly drought-tolerant once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sophora is a genus of about 45 species of small trees and shrubs in the pea family Fabaceae. The species have a pantropical distribution. The generic name is derived from sophera, an Arabic name for a pea-flowered tree.
The genus formerly had a broader interpretation including many other species now treated in other genera, notably Styphnolobium (pagoda tree genus), which differs in lacking nitrogen fixing bacteria (rhizobia) on the roots, and Dermatophyllum (the mescalbeans). Styphnolobium has galactomannans as seed polysaccharide reserve, in contrast Sophora contains arabinogalactans, and Dermatophyllum amylose.
The New Zealand Sophora species are known as kowhai.
The seeds of species such as Sophora affinis and Sophora chrysophylla are reported to be poisonous.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rare Hawaiian dry forest variety thrives in environments mimicking its native Makua Valley habitat, requiring full sun and well-draining soil. It is adapted to periods of drought, so water moderately and allow the soil to dry out between sessions. Fertilizer needs are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to less nutrient-rich dry forest soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly, especially during active growth, but generally not a heavy feeder.
