## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, reflecting its Mediterranean chaparral origins. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal summer watering. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it can fix its own nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it likely fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil itself. Excessive fertilization, particularly nitrogen, can be detrimental. Lean to poor soils are generally preferred.
