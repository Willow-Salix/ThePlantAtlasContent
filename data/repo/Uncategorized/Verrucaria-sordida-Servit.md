## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions of Europe and North America, commonly found near freshwater bodies or coastal areas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Riparian/Coastal |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to indirect bright light. While it can tolerate some exposure, prolonged direct, intense sunlight should be avoided, especially if the substrate is not consistently wet. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent high humidity and constant moisture on its substrate. Frequent misting, a semi-aquatic environment, or placement in a terrarium with high humidity is crucial to mimic its native perpetually wet habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Verrucaria is a genus of lichenized (lichen-forming) fungi in the family Verrucariaceae. These lichens form crust-like growths on rocks, particularly limestone and other calcareous surfaces, though some species also grow on siliceous rock or occasionally on bark and soil. The genus includes both terrestrial species found in dry environments and marine species that can survive periodic flooding or permanent submersion in coastal and freshwater habitats. With about 150 accepted species worldwide, Verrucaria represents a challenging taxonomic group due to overlapping physical characteristics and the polyphyletic nature of the genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in high humidity and constant moisture, typically found on rocks near water. Provide partial shade to indirect bright light and ensure its substrate remains consistently wet. Fertilization is unnecessary and should be avoided.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients directly from the air and water. Traditional fertilizers can be harmful and lead to nutrient overload, which is detrimental to their growth.
