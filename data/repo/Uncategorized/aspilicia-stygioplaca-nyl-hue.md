# Aspilicia stygioplaca
### *Aspilicia stygioplaca (Nyl.) Hue*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic, boreal, and high-alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Scandinavia, parts of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada), and mountainous regions of Europe (e.g., Alps). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Boreal Forest (rocky outcrops), Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in exposed conditions typical of rocky outcrops in high-altitude or high-latitude environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent atmospheric moisture from rain, snowmelt, or high humidity. Can tolerate periods of desiccation but needs regular rehydration from ambient moisture, as it absorbs water directly rather than through roots in soil. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Aspilicia stygioplaca is a resilient lichen that thrives in cool, exposed, and well-ventilated environments. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture and can withstand periods of dryness, absorbing water directly from precipitation and humidity. No external fertilization is needed for its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require supplemental fertilization. It obtains all necessary nutrients from the air, rainwater, and its substrate.
