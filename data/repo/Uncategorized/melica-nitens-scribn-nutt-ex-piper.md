## 🌱 Overview
Melica is a genus of perennial grasses known generally as melic or melic grass. They are found in most temperate regions of the world.

Melic grasses are clumping to short-rhizomatous grasses. They have flowering culms up to 250 cm (98 in) tall bearing spikelets of papery flowers. The spikelets have between one and seven fertile flowers with a rudimentary structure at the distal end composed of one to four sterile florets. Some species of melic have corms, lending them the name oniongrass.
The genus is most diverse in South America and temperate Asia. Eight species are endemic to China. In North America, most species occur west of the Mississippi River, with exceptions being Melica mutica and M. nitens which occur throughout much of the southeast and lower Midwest respectively.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate grass thrives in partial to full sun and tolerates a range of soil moistures, preferring conditions where the soil dries between waterings. It has low to moderate fertilizer needs and is quite drought-tolerant once established, making it a low-maintenance option for appropriate climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring if desired, or none if soil is already reasonably fertile.
