## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thatch Palms thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, tolerating drought once established. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and fertilize lightly during the growing season to support healthy growth in conditions mimicking its tropical, often exposed, native habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Apply a balanced palm fertilizer 2-3 times during the growing season, especially if grown in nutrient-poor soils like its native sandy or limestone-rich areas.
