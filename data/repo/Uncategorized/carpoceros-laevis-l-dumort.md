### *Carpoceros laevis (L.) Dumort.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across North America (Southern and Western USA, Mexico) and parts of South America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Seasonal, characterized by periods of distinct wetness and dryness |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; requires bright, open conditions as it typically grows on exposed, disturbed ground. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist during its active growth period, allowing the soil surface to dry slightly between waterings. Tolerates periods of drought, often entering dormancy in dry conditions. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort thrives in bright, open conditions and requires consistently moist soil during its active growth phase, followed by drier periods mirroring its native seasonal climate. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, disturbed soils and therefore benefits from minimal to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This species is adapted to nutrient-poor, disturbed soils. Fertilization is generally not critical, but a very infrequent and highly diluted balanced fertilizer can be applied during active growth.
