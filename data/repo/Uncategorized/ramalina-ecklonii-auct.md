## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Africa (e.g., South Africa, Namibia), coastal Australia, and parts of South America (e.g., Chile) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean to Subtropical Coastal (characterized by seasonal rainfall, high atmospheric humidity, frequent fog, and dew) |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. Good air circulation is essential. Can tolerate some direct morning sun, but intense, prolonged direct light without high humidity can cause drying. |
| **💧 Water** | No traditional watering. Requires consistent high atmospheric humidity. Regular misting with distilled or rainwater (daily to several times a week depending on ambient conditions) is crucial. Allow it to dry out between mistings to prevent mold. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen thrives in environments with high atmospheric humidity, bright indirect light, and excellent air circulation. Mimic its native coastal habitat by providing frequent misting with pure water and allowing it to dry slightly between applications to prevent rot. Avoid any fertilizers as lichens absorb all necessary nutrients from the air and water.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens are highly sensitive to nutrients and pollutants, absorbing trace elements from the air and precipitation. Added fertilizers would likely be detrimental.
