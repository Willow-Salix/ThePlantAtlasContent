| **🌍 Origin** | Texas, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-arid Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sun daily) is preferred, as it thrives in open, exposed environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent and deep watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its drought-tolerant nature in arid regions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Machaeranthera is a genus of North American flowering plants in the family Asteraceae which are known by the common name tansyaster.
Tansyasters are variable in appearance. Some are small, singular wildflowers, while others are sprawling shrubs. Several species easily hybridize with each other, as well, making identification difficult. In general, members of the genus may be identified by the sharp-pointed, dagger-shaped anthers in the disc florets at the center of the flower. The flower heads are usually daisylike, and are usually a shade of purple or blue, but may be pink, yellow, or white. Tansyasters are native to western North America.
The genus Machaeranthera is distinguished from the genus Dieteria by having once- or twice-pinnate leaves, whereas Dieteria has entire to toothed leaves.
Machaeranthera means "swordlike anthers".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Correll's Woody-Aster requires full sun and thrives in arid, well-draining conditions, typical of its native Texas scrublands. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry completely, and provide minimal to no fertilizer to mimic its natural environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is needed; this plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, often gypseous soils. A very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during active growth, if at all.
