## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Divaricate Cinquefoil thrives in full sun to partial shade within well-drained soil. Provide moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly as it prefers lean conditions typical of its native montane habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils and does not require heavy fertilization.
