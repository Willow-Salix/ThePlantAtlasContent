## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Rocky Mountains of the United States and Canada (e.g., Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Alberta, British Columbia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine Boreal Forest / Montane |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers ample sunlight for optimal growth but can tolerate some shade, especially when young. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular and consistent moisture is crucial, mimicking its native habitat with significant snowmelt and summer rainfall. Requires well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot, especially during drier periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Firs are evergreen coniferous trees belonging to the genus Abies (Latin: [ˈabieːs]) in the family Pinaceae. There are approximately 48–65 extant species, found on mountains throughout much of North and Central America, Eurasia, and North Africa. The genus is most closely related to Keteleeria, a small genus confined to eastern Asia.
They are tall trees that can be distinguished from other members of the pine family by the way in which their needle-like leaves are attached singly to the branches with a circular base, and by their cones, which, like those of cedars, stand upright on the branches like candles and disintegrate at maturity. 
The wood of firs is used for pulp to make paper, for plywood, and for indoor construction. Some species serve as Christmas trees, while others are used as decorative trees with their brightly coloured cones. In art, Lucas Cranach the Elder painted Madonna under the fir tree for Wrocław Cathedral in 1510.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This subalpine conifer thrives in cool, consistently moist, well-drained soil under full sun to partial shade conditions. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, and avoid heavy fertilization to mimic its natural environment and prevent stress.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to forest soils that are not overly rich. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial for young or struggling trees, but established plants often require little.
