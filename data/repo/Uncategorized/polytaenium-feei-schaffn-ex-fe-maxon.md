## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical rainforest fern thrives in high humidity and consistent moisture, requiring excellent drainage. Provide low to medium indirect light, protecting it from any direct sun. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted solution during its active growing period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. Use a diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., quarter strength) sparingly during the growing season (spring/summer), once a month at most. As an epiphyte, it naturally receives nutrients from decaying organic matter and rainwater.
