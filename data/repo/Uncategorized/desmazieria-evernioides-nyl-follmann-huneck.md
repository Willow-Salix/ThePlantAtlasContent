# Desmazieria evernioides (Nyl.) Follmann & Huneck
### *Desmazieria evernioides (Nyl.) Follmann & Huneck*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Canary Islands, North Africa (e.g., Morocco), Southwestern Europe (e.g., Portugal, Spain) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean/Semi-Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun, often found in exposed positions on trees or rocks. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent hydration, relying on atmospheric moisture (mist, dew, rain) rather than direct watering. Requires periods of complete dryness between wetting events. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in bright, indirect light with excellent air circulation, mimicking its native Mediterranean scrubland habitat. It requires infrequent hydration from mist or occasional wetting, allowing for complete drying between cycles. Fertilization is unnecessary and should be avoided as it can be detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is needed or recommended; lichens derive nutrients from the air and substrate and are sensitive to excess nutrients.
