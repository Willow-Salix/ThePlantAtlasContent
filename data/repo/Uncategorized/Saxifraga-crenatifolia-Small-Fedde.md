## 🌱 Overview
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, reminiscent of its Appalachian mountain home. It requires consistently damp, well-drained soil and protection from direct, intense sunlight. Fertilization should be minimal, aligning with its adaptation to naturally lean, rocky substrates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it naturally grows in leaner, rocky soils; a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
