## 🧤 Care Instructions
Zornia, a resilient pantropical legume, flourishes in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soils typical of its native grasslands and savannas. It prefers moderate watering, letting the soil dry out between sessions, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. This makes it a relatively low-maintenance plant adapted to varying conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; as a legume, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen, reducing the need for high nitrogen fertilizers in its typically nutrient-moderate native soils.
