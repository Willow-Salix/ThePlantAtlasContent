## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mt. Diablo Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native dry Mediterranean climate. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering primarily during prolonged dry spells. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it typically needs no fertilization and prefers lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally not needed. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in lean soils and excessive nitrogen can be detrimental. If soil is exceptionally poor, a low-nitrogen, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
