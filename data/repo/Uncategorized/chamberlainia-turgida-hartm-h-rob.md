## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cold-hardy moss needs a constantly wet substrate and bright, indirect light to thrive. It is adapted to nutrient-poor or moderately rich conditions, so minimal fertilization is required. Avoid dry conditions and intense heat to ensure its survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very minimal; a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly (e.g., once or twice a year) or not at all, as it is adapted to nutrient-limited environments.
