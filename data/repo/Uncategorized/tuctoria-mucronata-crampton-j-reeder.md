## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Valley of California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Grassland/Shrubland (Vernal Pool ecosystem) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) as it grows in open, unshaded vernal pool environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Abundant water during the winter and spring growing season, mimicking the saturation of vernal pools. A complete dry period in summer and fall is essential for dormancy, as natural vernal pools dry out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Tuctoria is a genus of three species of grass in the family Poaceae. Spiralgrass is a common name for plants in this genus. These are bunchgrass species that are found in vernal pools of central California and Baja California, Mexico. The plants  are annuals that germinate under water in the spring and grow submerged for weeks. After the pools dry down, the grasses initiate a new set of foliage that lasts for one to two months until flowering and fruiting are complete.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To cultivate Prickly Spiralgrass, replicate its native vernal pool environment by providing full sun and ensuring abundant water throughout its winter and spring growing season. Allow the plant to experience a complete dry dormancy during the summer and fall months, consistent with its natural lifecycle in the Central Valley of California.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, applied sparingly during the active growth period (winter/spring). Vernal pool soils are typically not excessively rich.
