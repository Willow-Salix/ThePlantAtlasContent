## 🌱 Overview
Cheilanthes, commonly known as lip ferns, is a genus of about 180 species of rock-dwelling ferns with a cosmopolitan distribution in warm, dry, rocky regions, often growing in small crevices high up on cliffs.  Most are small, sturdy and evergreen.   The leaves, often densely covered in trichomes, spring directly from the rootstocks.  Many of them are desert ferns, curling up during dry times and reviving with the coming of moisture.  At the ends of veins sporangia, or spore-bearing structures, are protected by leaf margins, which curl over them.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Powdery Cloak Fern thrives in conditions mimicking its native semi-arid, rocky habitat. Provide excellent drainage, partial sun to bright indirect light, and water infrequently, allowing the soil to fully dry out between waterings. Fertilization is generally not required.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. If fertilized, use a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly during the growing season.
