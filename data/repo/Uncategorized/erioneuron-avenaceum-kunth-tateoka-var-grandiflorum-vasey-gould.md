## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, requiring minimal water once established. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs very little fertilizer, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; a light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, especially in poor soils, or none at all.
