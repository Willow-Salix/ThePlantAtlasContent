## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its Mediterranean native habitat. It requires moderate watering during spring but becomes drought-tolerant once established, tolerating dry summers. Avoid over-fertilizing, especially with nitrogen, as it naturally enriches the soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and prefers leaner soils. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers, which can inhibit flowering.
