## 🌱 Overview
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lecanora atriseda is a lichen native to temperate and boreal forests, typically found on tree bark. It thrives in high ambient humidity and indirect light, absorbing moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere. Avoid direct sun and never attempt to fertilize.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air and the substrate, and added nutrients can be detrimental.
