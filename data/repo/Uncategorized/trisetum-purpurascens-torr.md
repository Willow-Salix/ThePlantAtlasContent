## 🧤 Care Instructions
This high-altitude grass thrives in cool, exposed conditions, requiring full sun and consistent moisture in well-drained soil. It is adapted to lean nutrient environments, thus requiring minimal to no fertilization to flourish.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to minimal; adapted to lean, nutrient-poor mountain soils. Excessive fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
