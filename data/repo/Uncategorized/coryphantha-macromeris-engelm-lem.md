## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in abundant sunlight and extremely well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Allow the soil to dry completely between waterings and fertilize sparingly during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Apply a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus/succulent fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
