## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Minidoka Penstemon thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its origins in the semi-arid steppes of Idaho. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established. Minimal to no fertilization is needed for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically needs minimal to no fertilizer. If necessary, a very light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all in naturally lean soils.
