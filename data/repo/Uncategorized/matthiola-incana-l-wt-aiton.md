## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, including Southern Europe (e.g., France, Italy, Spain, Portugal), North Africa (e.g., Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia), and the Near East (e.g., Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters), often found in coastal areas, cliffs, and sandy shores. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun is essential (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) to replicate its exposed, open native coastal habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate and consistent watering is needed during active growth and flowering. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot, but do not let the plant completely dry out for extended periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Matthiola () is a genus of flowering plant in the mustard family Brassicaceae. It is named after Italian naturalist Pietro Andrea Mattioli (1501–1577). The genus contains about 50 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous plants and subshrubs.  Many are cultivated for their heavily scented, colorful flowers.
The common name stock may be applied to the whole genus, more specifically to varieties and cultivars of Matthiola incana.  The common names evening stock and night-scented stock are applied to varieties of Matthiola longipetala (syn. M. bicornis). The common name Virginia stock refers to a separate genus of the same family (Malcolmia maritima).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tenweeks Stock thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its Mediterranean coastal origins. Provide moderate, consistent watering during its active growth and flowering, ensuring the soil doesn't become waterlogged. Fertilize sparingly to encourage robust blooms without excessive foliage growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly every 4-6 weeks during the growing season, especially in poorer soils. Over-fertilization can lead to lush foliage at the expense of flowers.
