## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ipomoea eriocarpa thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native tropical and subtropical savanna and open woodlands, requiring ample light for vigorous growth. It prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil during its active growing season but is not overly demanding on nutrients. Provide moderate watering and minimal fertilization to mimic its natural environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a month during peak growth, or less frequently if soil is naturally rich, as it's not a heavy feeder.
