# Higgins' Barberry
### *Mahonia higginsiae (Munz) Ahrendt*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California (South Coast Ranges, Peninsular Ranges), USA, and Baja California, Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean climate scrubland and chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in full sun in coastal or cooler areas, benefiting from partial afternoon shade in hotter inland regions. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry summers. Requires regular watering during its first year to establish, then infrequent to no supplemental water in summer once mature. Good drainage is essential to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Mahonia is a formerly accepted genus of approximately 70 species of shrubs or, rarely, small trees with evergreen leaves in the family Berberidaceae, native to eastern Asia, the Himalaya, North America, and Central America. They are closely related to the genus Berberis and as of 2023 the majority of botanical sources list it as a synonym for Berberis.
However, there is still disagreement among botanists, and as recently as 2017 papers have been published arguing for the validity of the genus. In addition, sources that are updated less frequently like the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service PLANTS database have many plants listed in Mahonia.
Most botanists prefer to classify Mahonia as a part of Berberis because several species in both genera are able to hybridize, and because there are no consistent morphological differences between the two groups other than the leaf pinnation (Berberis sensu stricto appear to have simple leaves, but these are in reality compound with a single leaflet and are termed "unifoliolate"; additionally their branched spines are modified compound leaves). However, recent DNA-based phylogenetic studies retain the two separate genera, by clarifying that unifoliolate-leaved Berberis s.s. is derived from within a paraphyletic group of shrubs bearing imparipinnate evergreen leaves, which are then divided into three genera: Mahonia, Alloberberis (formerly Mahonia section Horridae), and Moranothamnus (formerly Berberis claireae); a broadly-circumscribed Berberis (that is, including Mahonia, Alloberberis, and Moranothamnus) would also be monophyletic.
Mahonia species bear pinnate leaves 10–50 cm (3.9–19.7 in) long with 3 to 15 leaflets, and flowers in racemes which are 5–20 cm (2.0–7.9 in) long. Several species are popular garden shrubs, grown for their ornamental, often spiny, evergreen foliage, yellow (or rarely red) flowers in autumn, winter and early spring, and blue-black berries. The flowers are borne in terminal clusters or spreading racemes, and may be among the earliest flowers to appear in the growing season. The ripened fruits are acidic with a very sharp flavor. The plants contain berberine, a compound found in many Berberis and Mahonia species which in high doses causes vomiting, lowered blood pressure, reduced heart rate, lethargy, and other ill effects when consumed.
The genus name, Mahonia, derives from Bernard McMahon, one of the stewards of the plant collections from the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The type species of the genus is M. aquifolium.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant shrub thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil, echoing its native Mediterranean scrubland habitat. Once established, it requires minimal supplemental watering and low fertilizer, making it an excellent, low-maintenance choice for arid-adapted landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant is adapted to leaner soils; excessive fertilization is not recommended. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring or a layer of compost can be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary once established.
