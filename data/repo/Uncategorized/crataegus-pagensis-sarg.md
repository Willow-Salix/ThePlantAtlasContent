## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Page's Hawthorn thrives in temperate forest conditions, preferring full sun and well-drained soil with moderate, consistent moisture. It requires minimal fertilization and is quite adaptable once established, tolerating a range of soil types and seasonal changes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or well-rotted compost application in early spring is sufficient, particularly in poorer soils. Avoid excessive fertilization.
