## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in bright, cool conditions with well-draining, rocky soil, mirroring its high-altitude native habitat. Provide full sun to partial shade and allow soil to dry between moderate waterings. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.
