## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, Mt. Kaala Cyanea requires an environment that closely mimics its native montane wet forest: high humidity, consistently moist (but not waterlogged) well-draining soil, and bright, indirect light. Protect it from direct sun and provide regular, dilute fertilization during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer during the growing season. Native forest soils provide a steady, albeit often leached, supply of nutrients.
