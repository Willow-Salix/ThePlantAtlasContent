## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |

| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Most species thrive in open, bright locations, common in their native rocky and alpine environments where canopy cover is minimal. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist but very well-drained soil, allowing it to dry out slightly between waterings. Intolerant of waterlogging, reflecting its native sandy/rocky habitats. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sandworts require well-drained soil, full to partial sun, and moderate watering, ensuring the soil dries between applications to prevent rot. They are adapted to lean soils, so minimal fertilization is needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Native to often lean, nutrient-poor soils, so a light application of balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, or none if soil is already reasonably fertile, is sufficient.
