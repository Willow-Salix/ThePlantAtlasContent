## 🧤 Care Instructions
Purple Moorgrass thrives in consistently moist, acidic soils under full sun to partial shade, mimicking its native heathland and bog environments. It requires ample water, especially during active growth, but has low to moderate fertilizer needs due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
