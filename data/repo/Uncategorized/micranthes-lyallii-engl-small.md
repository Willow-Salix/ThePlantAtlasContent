| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, Montana, Wyoming), specifically in the Cascade Range and Rocky Mountains. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate full sun in cooler climates but prefers protection from intense afternoon heat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Micranthes is a genus of flowering plants in the saxifrage family. It was formerly included within the genus Saxifraga until DNA evidence from 1996 showed the members of what is now Micranthes are more closely related to Boykinia and Heuchera than to other members of the genus Saxifraga.
All members of this genus are herbaceous, with prominent basal leaves. They are found in temperate, arctic, and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.
