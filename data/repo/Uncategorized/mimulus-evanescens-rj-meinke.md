## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Mediterranean climate with distinct wet winters and dry summers, specifically thriving in ephemeral wetlands and vernal pools. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright, direct light for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Abundant and consistent moisture is crucial during its active growing season (winter and spring), mimicking its native ephemeral wetland habitat. The soil should be kept consistently wet. Allow to dry out completely during its summer dormancy period. |

## 🌱 Overview
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Disappearing Monkeyflower is an ephemeral annual best grown by replicating its native vernal pool conditions. It thrives in full sun with constantly wet soil during its short active growing season, followed by a completely dry dormancy. Minimal fertilization is needed for this short-lived plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It is not a heavy feeder. A dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during its active growth phase if desired, but rich soil is not necessary.
