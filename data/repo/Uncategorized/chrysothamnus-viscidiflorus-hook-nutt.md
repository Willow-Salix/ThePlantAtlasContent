## 🌱 Overview
Chrysothamnus, known as rabbitbrush, rabbitbush, and chamisa, are a genus of shrubs in the family Asteraceae. The native distribution is in the arid western United States, Canada, and northern Mexico. It is known for its bright white or yellow flowers in late summer.
Chrysothamnus may grow up to a 120 cm (47 in) tall shrub or subshrub, usually with woody stem bases.  The leaves are alternate, sessile or with short petioles, with entire edges. The flowerheads are singular or in clusters. Each composite flower often has five to 6 (though sometimes upwards of 40) yellow disc florets and no ray florets.
Chrysothamnus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora linosyridella, Coleophora viscidiflorella (which have both been recorded on C. viscidiflorus) and Schinia walsinghami.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and arid conditions, requiring minimal care once established. Emphasize extremely well-draining soil and very infrequent watering, as it's highly susceptible to overwatering. Avoid fertilizing, as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils. Fertilizing can be detrimental.
