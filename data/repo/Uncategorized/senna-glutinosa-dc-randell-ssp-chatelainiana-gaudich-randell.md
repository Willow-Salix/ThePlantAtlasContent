## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Australian native thrives in bright, full sun and requires minimal watering once established, reflecting its arid habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs very little supplemental fertilizer to flourish, making it ideal for xeriscaping or low-maintenance gardening in appropriate climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Its native soils are often nutrient-poor, and as a legume, it can fix nitrogen. An annual light application of a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth appears weak.
