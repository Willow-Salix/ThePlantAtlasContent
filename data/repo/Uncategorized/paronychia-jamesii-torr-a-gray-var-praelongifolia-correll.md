## 🌱 Overview
Paronychia is an inflammation of the skin around the nail, often due to bacteria or fungi.  
Its sudden (acute) occurrence is usually due to the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Gradual (chronic) occurrences are typically caused by fungi, commonly Candida albicans. 
Risk factors for paronychia include frequent hand washing and trauma to the cuticle, such as from chronic nail biting or hangnails.
Treatment typically involves antibiotics for bacterial infections and antifungals for fungal infections. If there is pus formation, incision and drainage may be necessary.
Paronychia is commonly mistakenly used interchangeably with herpetic whitlow or felon, which are distinct conditions.
