## 🌱 Overview
Ficus ( or ) is a genus of about 850 species of woody trees, shrubs, vines, epiphytes and hemiepiphytes in the family Moraceae. Collectively known as fig trees or figs, they are native throughout the tropics with a few species extending into the semi-warm temperate zone. The common fig (F. carica) is a temperate species native to southwest Asia and the Mediterranean region (from Afghanistan  to Portugal), which has been widely cultivated from ancient times for its fruit, also referred to as figs. The fruit of most other species are also edible though they are usually of only local economic importance or eaten as bushfood. However, they are extremely important food resources for wildlife. Figs are also of considerable cultural importance throughout the tropics, both as objects of worship and for their many practical uses.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Edible Fig thrives in full sun, mirroring its native Mediterranean habitat. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and benefits from light, balanced fertilization during its active growth. Ensure excellent drainage and provide less water during its winter dormancy.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced fertilizer during the active growing season (spring through late summer). Native soils are often not exceptionally rich, so avoid over-fertilizing.
