## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Billings' Sedge thrives in consistently wet to waterlogged conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade. Mimicking its native bog and fen habitats, it requires constant moisture and is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils, thus needing very little, if any, fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nutrient needs; rarely requires fertilization, or a very dilute application of fertilizer formulated for acid-loving wetland plants, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils.
