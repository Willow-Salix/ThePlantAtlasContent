## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Pacific Islands (e.g., Samoa, Fiji, Tonga) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate indirect light; thrives in dappled shade, avoiding direct sun which can scorch fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, mimicking high tropical rainfall and humidity; allow the top inch of soil to just begin to dry before re-watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Marattia is a small genus of basal, large, fleshy eusporangiate ferns. 
Formerly considered to be a much larger genus, genetic analysis has shown that Marattia in the broad sense was paraphyletic, and subsequently the genera Ptisana and Eupodium were split off. Except for one species in Hawaii, the genus is neotropical.
The plants are large and terrestrial, with more or less erect rhizomes and fronds being 2-5 times pinnate. Sporangia are fused into synangia, and spores are monolete.
Basal chromosome count is 2n=80. The type species is M. alata.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fern requires a consistently moist, well-draining soil and high humidity, typical of its tropical rainforest origin. Provide low to moderate indirect light and fertilize sparingly during its growth period. Protect it from direct sun and ensure adequate air circulation to prevent fungal issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength, once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer).
