## 🌱 Overview
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Tall Mountain Larkspur, provide full sun exposure and extremely well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid montane habitat. Water moderately during its spring growth and bloom cycle, then reduce watering drastically as it tolerates drought and may go dormant in summer. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires lean to average soil; a light, balanced fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial but is often unnecessary in good garden soil.
