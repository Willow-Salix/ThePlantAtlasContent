## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically mountainous regions of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Washington, Oregon (USA) and British Columbia (Canada). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Montane |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat on open, exposed slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Low; it is highly drought-tolerant once established. Mimic its native dry, well-drained conditions by allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Piper's Sulphur Buckwheat thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean to rocky soils, reflecting its subalpine and alpine native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and virtually no fertilization. Mimic its natural exposed, nutrient-poor environment for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; this plant thrives in lean, rocky soils. Over-fertilizing can be detrimental, so avoid regular fertilization.
