## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in very bright, direct sunlight and requires excellent drainage. Water sparingly and deeply only when the soil is completely dry, and significantly reduce watering in cooler months. Provide a well-draining soil mix and minimal fertilization to mimic its harsh native habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; a diluted, low-nitrogen fertilizer specifically formulated for cacti and succulents can be applied once or twice during the active growing season.
