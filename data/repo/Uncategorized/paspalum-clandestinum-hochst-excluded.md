## 🌱 Overview
The tropical grass species Cenchrus clandestinus (previously Pennisetum clandestinum) is known by several common names, most often Kikuyu grass. It is native to the highland regions of East Africa that is home to the Kikuyu people. Because of its rapid growth and aggressive nature, it is categorised as a noxious weed in some regions. However, it is also a popular garden lawn species in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the southern region of California in the United States, being inexpensive and moderately drought-tolerant. In addition, it is useful as pasture for livestock grazing and serves as a food source for many avian species, including the long-tailed widowbird.  The flowering culms are very short and "hidden" amongst the leaves, giving this species its specific epithet (clandestinus).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Kikuyu Grass is a vigorous, sun-loving perennial that thrives in open, warm environments. It requires full sun exposure and moderate, consistent watering for optimal growth, although it shows good drought tolerance once established. Regular fertilization during the growing season will promote dense, healthy turf.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high; benefits from regular feeding with a balanced lawn fertilizer during the growing season.
