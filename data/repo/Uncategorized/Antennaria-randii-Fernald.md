| **🌍 Origin** | Northeastern North America (Eastern Canada and Northeastern United States) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Open Rocky Habitats |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it naturally grows in exposed, open areas. |

## 🌱 Overview
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its rocky native habitats. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization to mimic its natural, less fertile environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean soils and rarely requires fertilization. An annual light feeding in spring is sufficient if growth is poor.
