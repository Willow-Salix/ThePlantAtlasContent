## 🧤 Care Instructions
Native to the sunny temperate grasslands of South America, this plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. It requires moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry out between waterings, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Provide light to moderate fertilization during its active growth periods.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer). Native grassland soils are not overly rich, so excessive feeding is not necessary.
