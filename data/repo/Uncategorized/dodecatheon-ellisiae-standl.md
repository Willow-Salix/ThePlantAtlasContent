## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mountainous regions of New Mexico and Colorado, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane/Subalpine Forest and Rocky Outcrops |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun in cooler climates or during morning hours, but benefits from partial shade in hot afternoon sun to prevent stress. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture during its active growth phase in spring, typically from snowmelt. Requires excellent drainage to prevent rot. Allow soil to dry out completely as the plant enters summer dormancy, requiring little to no water during this period. |

## 🌱 Overview
Primula sect. Dodecatheon is a section of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. Primula species in this section were formerly placed in a separate genus, Dodecatheon. The species have basal clumps of leaves and nodding flowers that are produced at the top of tall stems rising from where the leaves join the crown. The genus is largely confined to North America and part of northeastern Siberia. Common names include shooting star, American cowslip, mosquito bills, mad violets, and sailor caps. A few species are grown in gardens for their showy and unique flower display.
The stamens are thrust out with the sepals bent back. The flowers are pollinated by bees, which grab hold of the petals, and gather pollen by vibrating the flowers by buzzing their wings (buzz pollination). The vibration releases pollen from the anthers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This montane perennial thrives with consistent moisture in spring, well-drained soil, and full sun to partial shade. It enters summer dormancy, requiring a dry period with minimal watering. Fertilize sparingly in early spring for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in average to poor, rocky soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial, but avoid over-fertilizing.
