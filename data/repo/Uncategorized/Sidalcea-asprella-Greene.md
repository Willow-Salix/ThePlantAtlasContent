## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically Central and Northern California |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to light shade; prefers full sun for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the active growing season (winter and spring), becoming drought-tolerant in the dry summer months. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dwarf Checkerbloom thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean climate, preferring full sun and well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering during its winter and spring growth period, becoming accustomed to drought in summer. Fertilizer needs are minimal, suitable for lean native soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically does not require heavy feeding. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial in poor soils.
