## 🧤 Care Instructions
Phlegmariurus nutans thrives in a high-humidity environment with consistently moist, well-drained conditions, emulating its native tropical montane rainforest habitat. Provide indirect bright light and apply a diluted fertilizer sparingly during active growth to support its unique epiphytic nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder. Use a diluted liquid fertilizer (quarter strength) every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler, darker months.
