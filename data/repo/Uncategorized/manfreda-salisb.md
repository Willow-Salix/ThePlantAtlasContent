## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tuberose, native to Mexico's subtropical dry forests and scrublands, thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Water moderately during its summer growth phase, ensuring the soil dries out completely between waterings, and keep it dry during winter dormancy. Fertilize lightly during the growing season for best flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Apply a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer sparingly once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer). Avoid over-fertilizing.
