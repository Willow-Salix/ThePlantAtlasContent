## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Globally widespread in tropical, subtropical, and humid temperate regions, particularly diverse in Central and South America, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Humid Forests (e.g., Rainforests, Cloud Forests) and humid temperate forests. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate, indirect light. Filtered sunlight or deep shade is ideal, as direct sun can quickly desiccate them. |
| **💧 Water** | High atmospheric humidity is critical. Regular misting (daily or several times a week, depending on ambient humidity) or placement in an enclosed, humid environment (like a terrarium) is necessary to keep the lichen moist. They absorb water directly from the air and rain; avoid prolonged dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Coenogonium is a genus of filamentous lichens in the monotypic family Coenogoniaceae. It has about 90 species. Most species are leaf-dwelling or grow on bark, although a few are known to grow on rocks under certain conditions, and some are restricted to growth on termite nests. The genus was circumscribed in 1820 by German naturalist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg.
Coenogonium has a worldwide distribution, with most species known from tropical areas. Most species grow in tropical rainforests in the shaded understorey. They typically grow on tree trunks, branches, lianas, and leaves.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dimerella lichens require a consistently humid environment with low to moderate, indirect light to mimic their native forest habitats. Regular misting is essential to maintain high atmospheric moisture, while direct sunlight and any form of traditional fertilization should be strictly avoided to ensure their health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens are highly sensitive to high nutrient levels and obtain necessary elements from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust, air). Standard fertilizers are harmful and unnecessary.
