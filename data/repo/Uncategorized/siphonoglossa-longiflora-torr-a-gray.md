## 🌱 Overview
Justicia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is the largest genus within the family, with over 900 accepted species. They are native to tropical to warm temperate regions of the Americas, India, and Africa. The genus serves as host to many butterfly species, such as Anartia fatima.  Common names include water-willow and shrimp plant, the latter from the inflorescences, which resemble a shrimp in some species. The generic name honours Scottish horticulturist James Justice (1698–1763). They are closely related to Pachystachys.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant desert plant requires full sun and minimal watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications. It thrives in well-draining soil with low to moderate fertility. Provide protection from excessive moisture and ensure good air circulation to mimic its native arid environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it thrives in the typically nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year during its active growth period should suffice.
