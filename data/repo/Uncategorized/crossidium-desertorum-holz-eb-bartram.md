# Desert Crossidium Moss
### *Crossidium desertorum Holz. & E.B. Bartram*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States, Mexico, North Africa, Middle East |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Deserts and Semi-Arid Scrublands |
| **☀️ Light** | High light to full sun exposure, adapted to intense direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Very infrequent watering. Allow substrate to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking desert rainfall patterns. Tolerates prolonged drought periods and rehydrates after rain. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert moss requires bright, intense light and very infrequent watering, allowing for complete drying between hydration cycles. Mimic its arid native habitat by providing a well-draining substrate and avoiding consistent moisture, which it handles through desiccation tolerance rather than constant dampness.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in nutrient-poor environments, typical of desert soils.
