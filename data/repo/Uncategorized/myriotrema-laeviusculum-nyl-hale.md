## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical rainforest lichen thrives in environments with very high humidity and extremely low, indirect light, mimicking its natural understory habitat. Avoid traditional fertilizers as they are detrimental, focusing instead on consistent moisture and clean air for healthy growth.
