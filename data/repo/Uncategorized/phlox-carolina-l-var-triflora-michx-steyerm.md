## 🧤 Care Instructions
Carolina Phlox thrives in conditions mimicking its native Southeastern U.S. humid subtropical environment. It requires full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide regular watering and a light annual feeding to support its vigorous growth and prolific flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, as native woodland soils are often moderately fertile from decomposing organic matter.
