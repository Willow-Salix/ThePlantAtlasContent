## 🧤 Care Instructions
This robust perennial flourishes in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its temperate grassland origins. Provide minimal water once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization for best results.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; a very light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring is optional, otherwise thrives in lean to moderately fertile soil.
