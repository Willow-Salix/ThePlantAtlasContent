## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy plant thrives in warm, bright conditions, preferring full to partial sun. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and has very low fertilizer needs, adapting well to leaner soils. Mimic its native tropical savanna environment with distinct wet and dry periods for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very diluted balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season.
