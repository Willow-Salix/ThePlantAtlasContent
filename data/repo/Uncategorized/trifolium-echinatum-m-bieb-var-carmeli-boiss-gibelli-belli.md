## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern Mediterranean, specifically Israel, Lebanon, and Syria |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, typical of open fields and pastures in its native habitat, requiring ample light for robust growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during its active growing season (cooler, wetter months), allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Tolerates significant dry periods, entering dormancy, during hot, dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Mediterranean clover thrives in full sun with well-draining soil, preferring consistent moisture during its active growing season in cooler months. As a nitrogen-fixer, it requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance ground cover well-adapted to dry summer dormancy.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. A balanced, low-phosphorus fertilizer or compost can be applied sparingly if soil nutrients are severely depleted.
