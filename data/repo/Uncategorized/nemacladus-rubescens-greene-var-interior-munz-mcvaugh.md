## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and very dry conditions, reflecting its native arid scrubland and desert environments. It requires minimal, infrequent watering and has very low fertilizer needs, preferring well-draining, poor soils. Overwatering should be strictly avoided to ensure its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. If necessary, a very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during its active growth period, but it generally thrives in nutrient-poor soils.
