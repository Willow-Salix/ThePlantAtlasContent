## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pineapple-weed is a highly adaptable plant, thriving in full to partial sun, reflecting its common presence in open, disturbed temperate environments. It requires moderate watering in well-drained soil and has very low fertilizer needs, often succeeding in poor soil conditions. Its hardy and opportunistic nature makes it exceptionally low-maintenance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soil; rich soil is not necessary and may not be beneficial.
