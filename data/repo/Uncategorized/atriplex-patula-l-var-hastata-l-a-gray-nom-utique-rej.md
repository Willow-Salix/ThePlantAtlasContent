## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia; naturalized widely in North America and other temperate regions. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Coastal and Disturbed Land (often saline or ruderal areas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. As it thrives in open, exposed areas like coastal plains, full sun is ideal for robust growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Thrives with consistent moisture, especially during establishment, but is quite tolerant of dry spells once mature, reflecting its ability to grow in sometimes dry coastal or disturbed sites. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Atriplex () is a plant genus of about 250 species, known by the common names of saltbush and orache (; also spelled orach). It belongs to the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae s.l.. 
The genus is quite variable and widely distributed. It includes many desert and seashore plants and halophytes, as well as plants of moist environments. 
The generic name originated in Latin and was applied by Pliny the Elder to the edible oraches. The name saltbush derives from the fact that the plants retain salt in their leaves; they are able to grow in areas affected by soil salination.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spear-leaved Orache is a resilient plant best suited for full sun exposure and well-drained soil, tolerating a range of conditions including moderate drought and salinity. Provide regular moisture, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and fertilize very sparingly as it is not a heavy feeder. This plant is often considered a weed in many regions due to its adaptability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to grow in often nutrient-poor or disturbed soils, including saline conditions. Supplemental fertilizer is generally not necessary, or only applied sparingly if soil is exceptionally poor.
