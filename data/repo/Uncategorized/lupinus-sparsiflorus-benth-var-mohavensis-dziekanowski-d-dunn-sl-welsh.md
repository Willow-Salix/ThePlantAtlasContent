## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mojave Lupine thrives in conditions mimicking its desert home, requiring full sun and extremely well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering, and has very low fertilizer requirements due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils and nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, and its native soils are typically nutrient-poor. If necessary, a very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year.
