## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (primarily Central Coast and Southern Coast Ranges) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate / Arid Scrubland / Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, reflecting its exposure in open, dry habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low water needs; extremely drought-tolerant once established. Allow soil to dry out completely between infrequent waterings, especially during summer dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Wicker Buckwheat thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid scrubland and chaparral environment. It requires minimal watering, being highly drought-tolerant, and prefers lean soil with little to no supplemental fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils common in its native habitat. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
