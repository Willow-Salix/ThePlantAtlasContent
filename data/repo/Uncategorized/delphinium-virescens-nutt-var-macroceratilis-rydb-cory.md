## 🌱 Overview
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Plains Larkspur requires full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native prairie habitat. It prefers consistent moisture during growth but demonstrates good drought tolerance once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, with good soil rich in organic matter being ideal.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in average to moderately fertile soils and benefits from organic matter rather than heavy fertilization.
