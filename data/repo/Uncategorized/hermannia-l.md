| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Africa, primarily South Africa |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland and Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure; prefers full sun for at least 6-8 hours daily, tolerating some partial shade in very hot climates. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hermannia is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It includes 170 species.
The genus commemorates Prof. Paul Hermann (1646-1695), a German professor of botany at Leyden and one of the first collectors to visit the Cape.
The genus has a large number of species, each with very limited distribution, but they are generally common and not threatened, with little interest shown in them for horticulture or medicine.
Their distribution ranges across Southern Africa, the vast majority of species being endemic. They are also found in Madagascar and in tropical East Africa to North East Africa and Arabia. A single species, Hermannia tigrensis, is found in western, southern and North-East Africa. Three species are found in northern Mexico and adjacent regions of the United States, one species in southern Mexico, and one in Australia. Hermannia's greatest diversity is found in the Western and Northern Cape, and Namibia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hermannia, native to arid and semi-arid regions of Southern Africa, thrives in full sun exposure. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering with periods of dry soil. Fertilize sparingly as it adapts well to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly during the growing season, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.
