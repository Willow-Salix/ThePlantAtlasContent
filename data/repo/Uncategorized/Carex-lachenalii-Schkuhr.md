| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Arctic Tundra (specifically wet meadows, fens, and bogs within these biomes). |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Sun. Thrives in open, exposed environments typical of tundra and alpine zones where direct sunlight is common. |

## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.
