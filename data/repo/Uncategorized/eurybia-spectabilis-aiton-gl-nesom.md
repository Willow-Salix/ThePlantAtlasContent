## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Eastern Showy Aster thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, though it tolerates some drought once established. Avoid overly rich soils as it prefers average fertility and benefits from only light fertilization. Ensure moderate watering during dry periods to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Native to soils that are typically average to lean in fertility, it benefits from a light application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, but avoids overly rich soil.
