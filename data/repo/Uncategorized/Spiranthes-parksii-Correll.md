## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rare orchid thrives in humid subtropical conditions, requiring consistently moist, well-drained soil and bright, indirect light. Protect it from harsh afternoon sun and provide very dilute fertilizer during its active growing season to mimic its native savanna environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, dilute orchid-specific fertilizer during active growth. Native soils are not overly rich.
