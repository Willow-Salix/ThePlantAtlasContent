## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands (Caribbean) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest / Tropical Wet Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to full sun, similar to the upper canopy of its host trees in a tropical forest environment. |
| **💧 Water** | As a parasitic plant, it relies on its host tree for water uptake. It thrives in environments with high ambient humidity and regular rainfall (benefiting the host and overall atmospheric moisture). |

## 🌱 Overview
Dendropemon is a genus of mistletoes which is endemic to the Caribbean. Members of the genus are hemi-parasites which normally grow on trees and shrubs, although self-parasitism is known to occur. The approximately 31 species range from The Bahamas and Cuba in the north and west, to Barbados and St. Vincent in the southwest. Diversity and endemism is highest on the island of Hispaniola.
The name Dendropemon coined by botanist Carl Ludwig Blume in 1830. He recognised it as a section within the genus Loranthus, rather than a distinct genus. Although no derivation was given for the name of the genus, it is believed to come from the Greek dendron (δένδρν), tree, and pemon (πήμων), harmful.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dendropemon sintenisii is a parasitic mistletoe that requires a specific host tree for survival, making direct cultivation extremely challenging or impossible without one. It thrives in high humidity and bright light conditions typical of tropical canopies, acquiring all its water and nutrients directly from its host. Care focuses on maintaining a healthy host plant in appropriate environmental conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Obtains all necessary nutrients directly from the sap of its host tree; external fertilization is not applicable for the mistletoe itself. A healthy, nutrient-rich host is essential for its survival.
