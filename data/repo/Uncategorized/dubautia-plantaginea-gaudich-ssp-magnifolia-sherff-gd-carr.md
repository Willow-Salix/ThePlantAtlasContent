## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (endemic) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Montane Wet Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. Mimics the dappled light of the forest understory or open gaps; avoid harsh, direct afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged. Water frequently, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly before rewatering, reflecting high rainfall in its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dubautia or na'ena'e is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. The genus was named after Joseph Eugène DuBaut (1796–1832), an officer in the French Navy who participated in Freycinet's expedition.
The entire genus is endemic to Hawaii. It contains more species than the other two genera in the silversword alliance, including cushion plants, shrubs, trees, and lianas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Originating from the wet montane forests of Hawaii, the Plantainleaf Dubautia thrives in conditions mimicking its native habitat. Provide bright, indirect light, consistent moisture with excellent drainage, and high humidity. Fertilize sparingly to support its growth in naturally nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer. These plants are adapted to naturally nutrient-poor volcanic soils and do not require heavy feeding.
