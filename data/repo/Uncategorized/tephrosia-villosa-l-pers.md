## 🌱 Overview
Tephrosia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is widespread in both the Eastern and Western Hemisphere, where it is found in tropical and warm-temperate regions.
The generic name is derived from the Greek word τεφρος (tephros), meaning "ash-colored," referring to the greyish tint given to the leaves by their dense trichomes. Hoarypea is a common name for plants in this genus, along with goat's rue and devil's shoestring.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hairy Tephrosia thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native tropical savanna and dry forest habitats. It requires moderate watering during its growing season, tolerating significant dry periods, and has low fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a leguminous plant, it fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. An occasional balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer during the growing season is sufficient, or none at all in fertile soils.
