## 🌱 Overview
Picea abies, the Norway spruce or European spruce, is a species of spruce native to Northern, Central and Eastern Europe.
It has branchlets that typically hang downwards, and the longest cones of any spruce, 9–17 cm long. It is very closely related to the Siberian spruce (Picea obovata), which replaces it east of the Ural Mountains, and with which it hybridises freely. The Norway spruce has a wide distribution for it being planted for its wood, and is the species used as the main Christmas tree in several countries around the world. It was the first gymnosperm to have its genome sequenced. The Latin specific epithet abies means "like 
Abies, Fir tree".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Norway Spruce thrives in cool, temperate to subarctic conditions with full sun and consistently moist, well-drained, acidic soil. It requires regular watering when young and during dry periods, with minimal fertilizer needs once established. Ensure adequate space for its mature size and root system.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to moderate. A slow-release, balanced fertilizer can be applied in early spring for young or deficient trees, but established trees often require little. Prefers acidic soil.
