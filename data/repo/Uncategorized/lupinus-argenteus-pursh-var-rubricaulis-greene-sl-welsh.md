## 🧤 Care Instructions
This variety of Silver Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its native montane grassland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry periods. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires minimal to no fertilizer and should avoid high-nitrogen feeds.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers as lupines are nitrogen-fixing plants and prefer lean soil.
