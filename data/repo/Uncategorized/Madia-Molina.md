## 🧤 Care Instructions
Madia Molina, a hardy annual, prefers full sun and thrives in lean, well-draining soils typical of its Mediterranean grassland origins. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and avoid rich fertilization to best mimic its natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
