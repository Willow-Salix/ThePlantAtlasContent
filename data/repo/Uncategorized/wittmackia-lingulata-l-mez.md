## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical epiphyte thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light. Maintain a consistently moist environment by keeping its central cup filled with fresh water and the growing medium evenly damp. Fertilize sparingly during warmer months to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As an epiphyte, it is a light feeder. Apply a diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/2 strength) to the central cup or as a foliar spray once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer).
