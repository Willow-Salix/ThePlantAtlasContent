## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Neotropical regions, particularly the Caribbean islands (Greater and Lesser Antilles), Central America, and northern South America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest / Rainforest understory |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade; avoid direct sunlight which can scorch fronds, mimicking its forest understory habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged; high ambient humidity is essential, requiring regular misting or placement in a humid environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Diplazium is a genus of ferns that specifically includes the approximately 400 known species of twinsorus ferns.  The Greek root is diplazein meaning double: the indusia in this genus lie on both sides of the vein.  These ferns were earlier considered part of either the Athyriaceae, Dryopteridaceae, Aspleniaceae, or Polypodiaceae families or recognized as belonging to their own taxonomic family. The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) places the genus in the Athyriaceae. The taxonomy of the genus is difficult and poorly known, and by 2009 has never been the subject of a complete monographic study. Their distribution is pantropical, with a few species extending into temperate areas.
The rhizome of the genus Diplazium varies from creeping to erect, and is scaly.  Its fronds are deciduous or evergreen, are trophopodic and are either monomorphic or weakly dimorphic.  The stipe is green, deeply grooved from above, and is either scaly or glabrous.  It always has two lunate vascular bundles.  The blades are either singular or in sets of two and are entirely pinnate, range from oblong-lanceolate to deltate, and from herbaceous to papery.  It has linear basal sori that are paired back-to-back on the same vein.  The indusium is linear and persistent, and the sporangia are brownish.
Some common species include Diplazium hymenodes, the peacock fern; Diplazium esculentum, the vegetable fern; Diplazium molokaiense, the Molokai twinsorus fern; and Diplazium lonchophyllum, the lance-leaved glade fern.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The scientific name indicates a historical misapplication of *Diplazium arboreum*. Assuming the plant shares characteristics with the true *Diplazium arboreum* and other tropical Diplazium species, it thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil and high humidity. It requires partial to full shade, protected from harsh direct sun, mimicking its native forest understory environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a diluted balanced liquid fertilizer (half strength) during the active growing season (spring/summer); avoid over-fertilizing.
