## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a lichen, Caloplaca peliophylla does not require traditional plant care like watering or fertilizing. It thrives in full sun conditions, absorbing all necessary moisture and nutrients directly from the ambient atmosphere and occasional rainfall. Maintaining good air quality and avoiding disturbance are crucial for its survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain nutrients from the atmosphere and substrate; artificial fertilizers are detrimental and can cause harm.
