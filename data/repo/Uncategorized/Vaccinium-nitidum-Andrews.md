## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Pine Flatwoods, Scrubby Flatwoods) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, bright environments characteristic of its native pine flatwood and scrubland habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture, especially during the growing season, but requires well-draining soil. Tolerant of brief dry spells once established, reflecting its adaptation to sandy, sometimes drought-prone soils. |

## 🌱 Overview
Vaccinium  vack-SIN-ee-əm is a common and widespread genus of shrubs or dwarf shrubs in the heath family (Ericaceae). The fruits of many species are eaten by humans and some are of commercial importance, including the cranberry, blueberry, bilberry (whortleberry), lingonberry (cowberry), and huckleberry. Like many other heath plants, they are restricted to acidic soils.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun with consistently moist, well-draining, and acidic soil. Fertilize sparingly with a product designed for acid-loving plants to mimic its native low-nutrient, acidic environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, specifically using formulations for acid-loving plants. Native soils are typically low in nutrients.
