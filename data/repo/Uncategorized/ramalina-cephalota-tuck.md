## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ramalina cephalota is a coastal lichen requiring high atmospheric humidity, frequent fog, and bright, indirect light to partial sun. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and environment, making traditional watering or fertilization unnecessary. Optimal care involves mimicking its native coastal scrub habitat conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens obtain nutrients from the environment (air, dust, rain) and do not require external fertilization.
