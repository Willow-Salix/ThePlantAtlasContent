## 🌱 Overview
Common chicory (Cichorium intybus) is a somewhat woody, perennial herbaceous plant of the family Asteraceae, usually with bright blue flowers, rarely white or pink. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to the Americas and Australia.
Many varieties are cultivated for salad leaves, chicons (blanched buds), or roots (var. sativum), which are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and food additive. In the 21st century, inulin, an extract from chicory root, has been used in food manufacturing as a sweetener and source of dietary fiber. Chicory is also grown as a forage crop for livestock.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Chicory prefers full sun and moderate watering, reflecting its origins in open temperate meadows. It is not a heavy feeder, thriving in average to even poor soils without extensive fertilization. This makes it a relatively low-maintenance plant once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it naturally thrives in average to poor soils and disturbed ground.
