## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah) and northern Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert Riparian Zones |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Thrives in intense, unobstructed light conditions typical of desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely drought-tolerant once established, requiring very infrequent deep watering. Mimic native conditions by allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, potentially only watering during prolonged dry spells or intense heat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Prosopis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. The current circumscription of the genus contains three species found in northern Africa, the Middle East, Central and South Asia. Previously it also contained around 40 species of spiny trees and shrubs found in subtropical and tropical regions of the Americas and Africa, now mostly placed in genera Strombocarpa and Neltuma. They often thrive in arid soil and are resistant to drought, on occasion developing extremely deep root systems. Their wood is usually hard, dense and durable. Their fruits are pods and may contain large amounts of sugar. The generic name means "burdock" in late Latin and originated in the Greek language.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient desert plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering once established, owing to its deep root system. It is highly adapted to lean desert soils and generally does not need supplemental fertilization. The key to its care is providing ample sunlight and mimicking its native arid conditions by allowing long dry periods between waterings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen, thriving in the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Supplemental fertilization is generally unnecessary and can even be detrimental.
