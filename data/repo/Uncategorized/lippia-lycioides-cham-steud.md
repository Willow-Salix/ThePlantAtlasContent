## 🌱 Overview
Lippia is a genus of flowering plants in the verbena family, Verbenaceae. It was named after Augustin Lippi (1678–1705), a French naturalist and botanist (with Italian origins). He was killed in Abyssinia. The genus contains roughly 200 species of tropical shrubs that are found around the world. Plants are fragrant due to their essential oils, which vary between species but may include estragole, carvacrol, linalool or limonene. The leaves of certain species, such as L. graveolens, can be used as a culinary herb similar to oregano.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lippia lycioides prefers full sun to partial shade and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions. It is adaptable to various well-draining soils and benefits from minimal fertilization during its active growth period. This plant is generally low-maintenance, reflecting its resilience in subtropical scrubland environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer. A general-purpose, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season to encourage robust growth, but over-fertilization should be avoided.
