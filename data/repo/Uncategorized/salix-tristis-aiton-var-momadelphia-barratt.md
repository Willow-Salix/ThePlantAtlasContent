## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dwarf Willow thrives in open, sunny locations with well-drained soil, adapting well to sandy or rocky conditions. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and is generally drought-tolerant once established. Mimicking its native temperate prairie and woodland habitat, it typically needs minimal fertilization for healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, generally not critical. A balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if growth is poor.
