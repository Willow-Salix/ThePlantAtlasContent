## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions characteristic of temperate montane and semi-arid regions. It requires moderate water when establishing but becomes very drought-tolerant, needing minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilization. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen, making additional nitrogen unnecessary and potentially harmful.
