## 🧤 Care Instructions
Native to the temperate grasslands and open, often dry, shrublands of Western North America, this plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. It is very drought-tolerant once established, preferring moderate watering with dry periods between, and has minimal fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically found in average to poor soils, this plant generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring may be beneficial if soil nutrients are very deficient.
