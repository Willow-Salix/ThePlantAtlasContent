## 🌱 Overview
Sarcopyrenia is a genus of lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) fungi. It has 11 species. It is the only genus in Sarcopyreniaceae, a family in the order Verrucariales. Sarcopyreniaceae is one of the few families composed entirely of lichenicolous fungi. These tiny fungi produce small, black, flask-shaped fruiting bodies (perithecia) typically less than half a millimetre across, containing extremely narrow, thread-like ascospores. While they initially grow on crustose lichens, their fruiting bodies often outlast their hosts and end up sitting on bare rock, making their exact relationship with lichens somewhat unclear.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hassea lichens are highly resilient organisms adapted to arid environments, requiring abundant light and extremely infrequent moisture, often from atmospheric sources. They do not need conventional fertilizers. Replicating a dry, well-ventilated habitat with good light is crucial for their minimal care.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and their substrate; traditional fertilizers can be harmful.
