## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, mirroring its native central U.S. prairies and open woodlands. It requires moderate watering during establishment but becomes drought-tolerant once mature, needing minimal additional moisture. Fertilizer needs are low, as it is adapted to lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to lean, average, or rocky soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization. Over-fertilizing can be detrimental.
