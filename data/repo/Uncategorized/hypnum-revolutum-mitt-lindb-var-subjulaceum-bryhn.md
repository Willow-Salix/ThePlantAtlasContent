## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in cool, consistently moist environments with filtered light. Ensure the substrate remains damp but not waterlogged, mimicking its alpine tundra origins, and avoid direct harsh sunlight. Minimal to no fertilization is required due to its low nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Mosses have extremely low nutrient requirements. Fertilizer is generally not needed; if used, apply a very weak, highly diluted solution infrequently.
