## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western and Northern North America (including much of Canada and the Western/Midwestern US) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Open Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in open, exposed areas typical of grasslands and forest edges. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate. Prefers consistently moist soil during active growth, but is tolerant of periodic drought once established, reflecting seasonal rainfall patterns in its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bromus is a large genus of grasses, classified in its own tribe Bromeae. They are commonly known as bromes, brome grasses, cheat grasses, or chess grasses. Estimates in the scientific literature of the number of species have ranged from 100 to 400, but plant taxonomists currently recognize around 160–170 species.
Bromus is part of the cool-season grass lineage (subfamily Pooideae), which includes about 3300 species.  Within Pooideae, Bromus is classified in tribe Bromeae (it is the only genus in the tribe).  Bromus is closely related to the wheat-grass lineage (tribe Triticeae) that includes such economically important genera as Triticum (wheat), Hordeum (barley) and Secale (rye).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate grass thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate watering, preferring consistently moist soil but tolerating drought once established. It is adaptable to average soil fertility, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant suited for its native North American climate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to average soil fertility; excessive fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring might benefit poor growth.
