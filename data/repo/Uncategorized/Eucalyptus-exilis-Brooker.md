## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern Western Australia, specifically inland regions and near Perth. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, often found in mallee shrublands and open woodlands. |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun exposure (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) to replicate its open, naturally exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry Australian summers. Water deeply and infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, especially crucial during establishment and prolonged dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Brooker's Mallee is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, adapted to Mediterranean climates. It requires minimal watering once established and generally has low nutrient needs. Avoid overwatering and excessive phosphorus fertilization for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Has low to moderate nutrient needs, thriving in relatively poor, well-drained soils. If fertilization is necessary, use a slow-release, low-phosphorus formula sparingly, as high phosphorus can be detrimental to Australian natives.
