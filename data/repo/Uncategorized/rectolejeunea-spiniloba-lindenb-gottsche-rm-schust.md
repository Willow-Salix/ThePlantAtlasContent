## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic bryophyte thrives in consistently high humidity and low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native tropical rainforest understory. Maintain continuous moisture in the substrate without waterlogging, and ensure excellent air circulation. Fertilizer needs are minimal, requiring only highly diluted feeds very sparingly.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very light, infrequent fertilization with a highly diluted liquid fertilizer; nutrient needs are minimal, as it primarily absorbs nutrients from rain and decaying organic matter.
