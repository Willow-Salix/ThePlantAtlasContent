## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Glacial Erigeron, provide full sun exposure and ensure it is planted in very well-drained soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and avoid over-fertilization. It is a cold-hardy plant well-suited to rock gardens or alpine settings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in lean, well-drained soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in very poor soils, but generally not strictly necessary.
