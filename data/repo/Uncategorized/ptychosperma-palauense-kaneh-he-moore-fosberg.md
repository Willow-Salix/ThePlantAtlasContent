## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical palm thrives in conditions replicating its native Palauan rainforest habitat, requiring warm temperatures, high humidity, and bright, indirect light. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil and provide regular fertilization during active growth to support its lush foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Regular feeding with a balanced, slow-release palm fertilizer during the growing season (spring to fall) is beneficial for optimal growth.
