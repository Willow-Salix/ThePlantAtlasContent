## 🧤 Care Instructions
This bluestem variety, native to the open, sunny grasslands and pine flatwoods of the Southeastern U.S., thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering, tolerating periods of drought once established, and has low fertilizer needs, thriving in average to poor soils without much intervention.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low, as it naturally thrives in nutrient-poor to average soils. Fertilizer is generally not needed, or a light application of a balanced, slow-release formula can be used in extremely depleted soils.
