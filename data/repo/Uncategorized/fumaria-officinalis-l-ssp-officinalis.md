## 🧤 Care Instructions
Drug Fumitory is an adaptable annual that thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moderately moist, well-draining soil. Reflecting its nature as a common weed in temperate agricultural lands, it is not highly demanding regarding nutrients, flourishing with minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during its growing season, or not at all if the soil is reasonably fertile.
