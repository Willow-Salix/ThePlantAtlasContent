## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Eastern Smooth Beardtongue thrives in full sun to partial shade with moderate, well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and is quite drought tolerant once established. Minimal to no fertilization is typically needed, as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean to average soil. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth. Generally, no fertilizer is needed if soil is decent.
