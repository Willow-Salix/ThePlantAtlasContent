| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine and Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, ideally with protection from intense afternoon heat in warmer climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings; requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot, especially during dormant periods. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine perennial thrives in cool, well-drained conditions, mimicking its native tundra habitat. Provide full sun exposure and ensure moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications to prevent waterlogging. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, minimal to no fertilizer is required.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; its native soils are typically nutrient-poor. Apply a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly, if at all, during the peak growing season.
