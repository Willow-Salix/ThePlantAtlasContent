## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America (from Ontario south to Florida and west to Wisconsin and Oklahoma) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Open Woodland/Prairie, often found in dry, sandy fields and clearings |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives best with ample direct sunlight, typical of open habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Tolerates drier conditions than many willows, preferring well-drained soil and allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant prefers full sun and well-drained, even sandy soils, mirroring its native open, dry habitats. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and apply a light to moderate fertilizer in spring for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, especially in sandy or less fertile soils.
