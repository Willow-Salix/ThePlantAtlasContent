## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wetland sedge thrives in cool, temperate conditions with consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its natural bog and fen habitats. It prefers bright light but is adaptable, and requires only low to moderate fertilization as it's accustomed to less nutrient-rich environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season (spring/summer).
