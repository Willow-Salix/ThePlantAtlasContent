## 🌱 Overview
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wetland plant thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, making it suitable for bog gardens or areas with naturally poor drainage. It tolerates partial shade to full sun, provided its high moisture needs are met. Minimal fertilization is required as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor to average soils found in its native wetland habitats; excessive fertilization is generally not necessary.
