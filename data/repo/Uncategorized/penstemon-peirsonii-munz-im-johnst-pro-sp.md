## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern California, USA (specifically Transverse Ranges and other southern California mountains) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Montane Chaparral (Mediterranean-like climate with dry summers and wet winters at higher elevations) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduced watering is needed during dormant dry seasons. |

## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Beardtongue is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of Southern California's chaparral. Provide full sun exposure and well-draining soil, watering sparingly once established as it is highly drought-tolerant. Minimal fertilization is required to ensure healthy growth and abundant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soil. Over-fertilization can harm the plant. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in early spring, or no fertilizer at all in rich garden soil, is sufficient.
