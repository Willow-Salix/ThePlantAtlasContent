## 🌱 Overview
Lunaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to North America and elsewhere. Species include:

L. annua (syn. L. biennis), annual or biennial
L. rediviva, perennial
L. telekiana. rare Balkan species
The Latin name Lunaria means "moon-like" and refers to the plants' decorative seedpods.
They have hairy toothed leaves and terminal racemes of white or violet flowers in Spring and Summer, followed by prominent, translucent, disc-shaped seedpods, which are frequently seen in flower arrangements.
They are widely grown as ornamental plants in gardens, and have become naturalised in many temperate areas away from their native habitat.
