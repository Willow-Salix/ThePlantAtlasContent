## 🧤 Care Instructions
Shining Milkwort is a desert-adapted plant that thrives in full sun and requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing its soil to dry out completely. It prefers lean, well-draining soils with minimal fertilization, reflecting its origins in arid scrubland environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs, thriving in lean to poor soils; a very light, balanced fertilizer application once a year in spring is sufficient, or none at all if planted in native soil.
