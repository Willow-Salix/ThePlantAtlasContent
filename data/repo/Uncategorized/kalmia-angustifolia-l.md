## 🌱 Overview
Kalmia angustifolia is a flowering shrub in the family Ericaceae, commonly known by various names including sheep laurel, wicky, and dwarf laurel. It is distributed in eastern North America from Ontario and Quebec south to Virginia, while the southern subspecies K. angustifolia ssp. carolina grows as far south as Georgia. It grows commonly in dry habitats in the boreal forest, and is also found in drier areas of peat bogs, or pocosins. It may become dominant over large areas after fire or logging. Like many plant species of infertile habitats it has evergreen leaves and mycorrhizal associations with fungi.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sheep laurel thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate boreal wetlands, requiring consistently moist, acidic soil and full to partial sun. It prefers nutrient-poor environments, so fertilization should be minimal or avoided to prevent stress.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; prefers nutrient-poor, acidic soils. If necessary, use a slow-release fertilizer formulated for acid-loving plants very sparingly.
