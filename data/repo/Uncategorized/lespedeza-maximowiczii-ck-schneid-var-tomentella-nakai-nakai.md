## 🌱 Overview
Lespedeza is a genus of some 45 species (including nothospecies) of flowering plants in the pea family (Fabaceae), commonly known as bush clovers or (particularly East Asian species) Japanese clovers (hagi). The genus is native to warm temperate to subtropical regions of eastern North America, eastern and southern Asia and Australasia.
These shrubby plants or trailing vines belong to the "typical" legumes (Faboideae), with the peas and beans, though they are part of another tribe, the Desmodieae. Therein, they are treated as type genus of the smaller subtribe Lespedezinae, which unites the present genus and its presumed closest relatives, Campylotropis and Kummerowia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate bush clover flourishes in East Asian climates, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist soil during its active growth. It is a low-maintenance plant, requiring only light fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, and adapts well to various soil types as long as they are well-draining.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization in spring; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen, often reducing the need for heavy nitrogen fertilizers. Benefits from soil rich in organic matter.
