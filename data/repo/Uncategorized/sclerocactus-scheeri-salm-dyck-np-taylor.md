## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in full, direct sun and requires extremely minimal water, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between waterings to prevent root rot. Provide a well-draining soil mix and fertilize sparingly with a diluted cactus formula during its spring and early summer growing period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization; use a low-nitrogen, high-potassium cactus fertilizer diluted to half strength once or twice during the active growing season (spring to early summer).
