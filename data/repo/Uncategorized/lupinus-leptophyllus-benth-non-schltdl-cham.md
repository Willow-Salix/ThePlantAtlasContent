## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Chilean lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean to semi-arid habitat. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and has low fertilizer needs due to its natural nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.
