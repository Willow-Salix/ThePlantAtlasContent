## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Caribbean (e.g., Jamaica, Cuba, Puerto Rico), Central America (e.g., Costa Rica, Panama), and northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Montane Rainforest / Cloud Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium, indirect light. Protect from direct, harsh sun, which can scorch its fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the substrate consistently moist but never waterlogged. Water frequently, allowing the top layer to just begin to dry between waterings, and maintain very high ambient humidity. |

## 🌱 Overview
Grammitis (dwarf polypody) is a genus of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae, subfamily Grammitidoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). It had formerly been placed in the family Grammitidaceae, but this family is no longer recognized by most authors because phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences have shown that it is embedded in Polypodiaceae.
The delimitation of Grammitis was drastically narrowed in the first decade of the 21st century. It now contains about 25 species. In 2003, a study of the distribution of grammitid ferns placed 11 species in the New World, 7 in Africa, and 4 in the Pacific.
The genus Grammitis was established by Olof Swartz around 1801. (sources vary on the exact date). The name is derived from Greek, gramma, grammatos meaning "a line or thread" and refers to the arrangement of the sori in some species. The  type species for Grammitis is Grammitis marginella.
The only known fossil of a grammitid fern has been named Grammitis succinea, but it is not clear that it belongs to Grammitis as more recently defined. It was found in Oligocene amber from the Dominican Republic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Grammitis hartii flourishes in conditions mirroring its native cloud forest habitat, requiring very high humidity, consistent moisture for its substrate, and low to medium indirect light. Avoid direct sun and allow for frequent, light fertilization during growth periods to ensure optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Lightly fertilize with a balanced liquid fertilizer (at half strength) every 2-4 weeks during its active growing season. As an epiphyte, it primarily absorbs nutrients from decaying organic matter and rainwater.
