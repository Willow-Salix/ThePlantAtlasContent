## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arid-adapted moss requires full to partial sun and extremely well-draining, nutrient-poor soil. Water sparingly and infrequently, allowing it to experience significant dry periods. It is highly tolerant of drought and will become dormant during dry spells, reviving with moisture.
