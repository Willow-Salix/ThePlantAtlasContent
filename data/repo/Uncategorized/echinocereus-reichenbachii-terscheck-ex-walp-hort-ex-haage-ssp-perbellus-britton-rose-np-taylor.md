## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and West Texas, and parts of Oklahoma, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Grasslands and Scrublands |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun to thrive, mimicking its natural exposure in open, arid environments. Provide at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **💧 Water** | Adapted to infrequent rainfall; water thoroughly only when the soil is completely dry, allowing extended dry periods between waterings. Reduce watering significantly in winter dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cactus thrives in environments replicating its native arid grasslands, requiring abundant full sun and very well-draining soil. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and fertilize minimally during the warmer months.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Native soils are typically low in nutrients; fertilize sparingly with a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
