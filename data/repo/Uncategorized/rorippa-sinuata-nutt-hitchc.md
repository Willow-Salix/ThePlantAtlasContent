## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spreading Yellowcress thrives in full to partial sun with consistently wet or saturated soil conditions, mimicking its native riparian and wetland habitats. It has low to moderate nutrient demands, often growing robustly in naturally fertile, disturbed moist areas without extensive fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in moderately fertile soils typically found in its native moist habitats. May benefit from a balanced fertilizer in poor soils.
