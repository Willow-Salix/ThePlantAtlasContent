# Sarcosagium Lichen
### *Sarcosagium campestre (Fr.) Poetsch & Schiedem.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including much of Europe and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Drylands / Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | High to full sun exposure, mimicking its natural habitat on open, exposed rocks and dry ground. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent and thorough rehydration, allowing the substrate to completely dry out between watering periods to simulate natural rainfall patterns in dry environments. Lichens can tolerate extended dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sarcosagium is a genus of fungi in the family Thelocarpaceae. It contains two species: Sarcosagium biatorellum and Sarcosagium campestre.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sarcosagium lichen thrives in high light conditions, ideally full sun, reflecting its exposed native habitat. It requires very infrequent watering, allowing complete drying between rehydrations, and has minimal to no need for fertilizer, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor rocky substrates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low to no fertilizer required, as it naturally grows on nutrient-poor rock surfaces and obtains necessary nutrients primarily from the air and rain.
