## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern Hemisphere, particularly cool-temperate to arctic-alpine regions (e.g., North America, Europe) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Boreal Forest margins |
| **☀️ Light** | Moderate to high indirect light; tolerant of direct sun in cool, moist conditions, often found on exposed rocks or bark. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies on frequent atmospheric moisture (rain, snowmelt, fog, dew) for rehydration and active growth; can tolerate prolonged dry periods by entering a dormant state. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lecidea gyrodes is a lichen adapted to cool, exposed alpine and boreal environments. It requires moderate to high light exposure and frequent rehydration from atmospheric moisture, as it does not utilize soil water. No traditional fertilization is needed, as it acquires nutrients directly from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed; obtains necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rain) and slow leaching from its substrate (rock or bark).
