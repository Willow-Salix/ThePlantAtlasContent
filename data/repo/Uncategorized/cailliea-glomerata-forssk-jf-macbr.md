## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical West and Central Africa (e.g., Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Sudan, Uganda) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Savanna and Woodland/Forest Margins |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers bright, direct light for optimal growth and fruiting. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture during the growing season, mimicking tropical wet periods. Allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings, but do not let it dry out completely. Tolerates some drought once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dichrostachys is an Old World genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. Their Acacia-like leaves are bi-pinnately compound. Unlike Acacia their thorns are hardened branchlets rather than modified stipules. They are native from Africa to Australasia, but a centre of diversity is present in Madagascar.
Their name is derived from the Greek words dis (two), chroos (colour) and stachys (grain ear or spike), which in combination suggests their bi-colored inflorescences.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical tree thrives in warm, sunny to partially shaded conditions with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimic its native savanna climate by providing ample water during growth and moderate fertilization. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or organic compost applied during the active growing season (spring and summer).
