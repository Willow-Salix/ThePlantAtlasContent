## 🌱 Overview
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This larkspur thrives in well-draining soil with full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native arid scrubland habitat. Provide moderate water during its spring growth, allowing it to dry out in summer. Fertilizer needs are minimal, suitable for lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of balanced fertilizer once in early spring is sufficient, as it is adapted to lean soils.
