## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Alpine regions, including Greenland, Scandinavia, and high elevations of North America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. It thrives in open, bright conditions typical of alpine environments but can benefit from some afternoon shade in warmer climates to maintain cooler soil temperatures. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist, replicating conditions found near snowmelt or in moist rocky crevices. Excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot in its naturally cold, damp environment. |
