## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hall's Columbiadoria thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its native rocky, open slopes. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring the soil to dry thoroughly between waterings. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to leaner nutrient conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. This plant is adapted to leaner soils; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring may be beneficial, but often it thrives without heavy feeding.
