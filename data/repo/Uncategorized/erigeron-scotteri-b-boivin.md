## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Canadian Rocky Mountains (Alberta, British Columbia, Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra/Subalpine Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, high-elevation habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings. It thrives in well-drained, often rocky, soils typical of its native environment and is susceptible to root rot if overwatered. |

## 🌱 Overview
Erigeron () is a large genus of plants in the composite family (Asteraceae). It is placed in the tribe Astereae and is closely related to the Old World asters (Aster) and the true daisies (Bellis). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and the highest diversity occurs in North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Scotter's Fleabane thrives in full sun and requires exceptionally well-drained soil to mimic its native alpine and subalpine habitats. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing as it is adapted to lean conditions. Provide cold dormancy for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial, but it is adapted to nutrient-poor alpine soils.
