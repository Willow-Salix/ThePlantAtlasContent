## 🧤 Care Instructions
Purple Bergamot thrives in full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native habitat in eastern North American woodlands. Provide regular watering, especially during dry spells, and minimal fertilization in average to rich soils. This approach ensures healthy growth and vibrant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in average to rich, well-draining soil. Minimal fertilization is typically needed; an annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial in poor soils.
