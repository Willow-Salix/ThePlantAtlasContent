## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (including Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Nevada, California) and northern Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert Margins |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is preferred, reflecting its natural exposure in open desert and scrubland environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, deep watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. This plant is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to root rot with overwatering, mimicking its adaptation to low and sporadic rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
The docks and sorrels, genus Rumex, are a genus of about 200 species of annual, biennial, and perennial herbs in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae.
Members of this genus are very common perennial herbs with a native almost worldwide distribution, and introduced species growing in the few places where the genus is not native.
Some are nuisance weeds (and are sometimes called dockweed or dock weed), but some are grown for their edible leaves. Rumex species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species, and are the only host plants of Lycaena dispar and Lycaena rubidus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its arid native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering and minimal fertilization. Mimic its desert environment to ensure its health and vigor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; native to often nutrient-poor desert soils. Rarely requires fertilization; if necessary, a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient.
