## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tree Mallows thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking their native Mediterranean climate. They are relatively drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering, and perform best with minimal fertilization to encourage flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly in spring with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer, especially if soil is poor. Excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth.
