| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically mountainous regions of British Columbia (Canada) and the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, USA). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine Meadow / Montane |

## 🌱 Overview
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Columbia Saxifrage thrives in cool, moist, well-drained conditions typical of subalpine meadows. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure consistent soil moisture without waterlogging. Fertilize sparingly to support its natural growth habits.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer can be applied sparingly in early spring, or none if planted in naturally rich, organic soil.
