## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid willow thrives in cool temperate riparian conditions, preferring full sun and consistently moist to wet soil. It benefits from moderate fertility and tolerates temporary inundation. Ensure ample water supply to mimic its natural habitat along waterways.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; annual balanced fertilizer application in spring, especially for young plants or poor soils.
