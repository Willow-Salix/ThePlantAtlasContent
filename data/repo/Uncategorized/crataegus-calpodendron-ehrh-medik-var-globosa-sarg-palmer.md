## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America (Southern Ontario and Quebec, Canada; throughout the eastern United States from New England south to Virginia, and west to Missouri and Minnesota) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest/Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade (at least 6 hours of direct sun for best fruiting and flowering, but can tolerate some afternoon shade). |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to regular watering; keep soil consistently moist, especially during establishment. Established plants are fairly drought-tolerant, reflecting moderate rainfall patterns in native habitats. |

## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate hawthorn, native to eastern North American woodlands, thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires consistent moisture when young but becomes drought-tolerant once established, mirroring its native climate's moderate rainfall. Fertilization is generally minimal, reflecting its adaptability to average forest soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not required for established plants in good soil. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring if soil is poor or growth appears weak.
