## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Phlox thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean to rocky soil, mimicking its native montane habitats. It is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, with minimal fertilization needs. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal, as it thrives in lean, rocky soils; an annual light application of balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth is poor.
