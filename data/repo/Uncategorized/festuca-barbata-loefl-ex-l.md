## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Basin (Southern Europe, North Africa, Western Asia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, tolerating some partial shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; infrequent watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during summer dormancy. Requires more moisture during its active growth in cooler months. |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This grass is adapted to hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, thriving in full sun and well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. It is very drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established. Fertilization is generally not necessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization.
