## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring dry conditions typical of its native temperate drylands. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization as it is adapted to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils and does not require rich nutrient levels.
