## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions, including Europe (e.g., France, Scandinavia, British Isles) and North America. Typically found on siliceous rocks. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal, often oceanic or montane, characterized by cool temperatures, regular precipitation, and high ambient humidity. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect to direct light. Tolerates full sun exposure, particularly when consistently accompanied by high humidity or frequent wetting. Protect from prolonged, intense, dry direct sun. |
| **💧 Water** | As a lichen, it absorbs moisture directly from the air. Requires high ambient humidity and regular wetting from mist, dew, or rain. Does not require soil watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This saxicolous lichen thrives in cool, humid, temperate to boreal environments. Provide bright indirect to direct light and ensure high ambient humidity with regular wetting (e.g., misting). Avoid traditional watering or fertilizing, as these practices are harmful to lichens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilization. It obtains nutrients from the air and substrate. Sensitive to pollutants and excess nutrients, which can be detrimental.
