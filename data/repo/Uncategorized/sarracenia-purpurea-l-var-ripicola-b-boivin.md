## 🌱 Overview
Sarracenia ( or ) is a genus comprising 8 to 11 species of North American pitcher plants, commonly called trumpet pitchers. The genus belongs to the family Sarraceniaceae, which also contain the closely allied genera Darlingtonia and Heliamphora.
Sarracenia is a genus of carnivorous plants indigenous to the eastern seaboard of the United States, Texas, the Great Lakes area and southeastern Canada, with most species occurring only in the south-east United States (only S. purpurea occurs in cold-temperate regions). The plant's leaves have evolved into a funnel or pitcher shape in order to trap insects.
The plant attracts its insect prey with secretions from extrafloral nectaries on the lip of the pitcher leaves, as well as a combination of the leaves' color and scent. Slippery footing at the pitcher's rim causes insects to fall inside, where they die and are digested by the plant with proteases and other enzymes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This carnivorous plant requires full sun and consistently wet, nutrient-poor, acidic soil, simulating its native bog habitat. It must be watered with pure water and should never have its soil fertilized, relying on insect capture for nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No soil fertilization is needed or recommended, as the plant obtains nutrients from captured insects. Supplemental feeding into pitchers is only necessary if natural insect prey is scarce.
