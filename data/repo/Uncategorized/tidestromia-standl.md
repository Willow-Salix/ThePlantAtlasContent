## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tidestromia is a resilient, drought-tolerant plant ideal for xeriscaping, thriving in hot, arid conditions. It requires full sun exposure and infrequent, deep watering, with the soil allowed to dry completely between sessions. Fertilization is generally not necessary, as it is adapted to low-nutrient environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is needed; these plants are adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils.
