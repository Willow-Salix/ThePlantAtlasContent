## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fissidens julianus is an aquatic or semi-aquatic moss that thrives in consistently moist to submerged conditions with low to moderate indirect light. Maintaining high humidity is crucial if grown emergent, and stable water parameters with occasional, dilute fertilization are beneficial for aquatic cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; mosses have minimal nutrient needs. Benefits from very dilute liquid aquatic plant fertilizer or general liquid fertilizer if nutrients are lacking, especially in aquariums.
