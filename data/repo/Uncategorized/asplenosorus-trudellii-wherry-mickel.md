## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America, particularly the Appalachian Mountains and surrounding regions of the eastern United States |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest (specifically humid, shaded, rocky habitats within this biome) |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light; prefers partial to full shade. Avoid direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the growing medium consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top layer to dry slightly between waterings. Requires high humidity. |

## 🌱 Overview
Asplenium × trudellii, commonly known as Trudell's spleenwort, is a rare hybrid fern of the eastern United States, first described in 1925. It is formed by the crossing of mountain spleenwort (A. montanum) with lobed spleenwort (A. pinnatifidum). Trudell's spleenwort is intermediate in form between its two parents, and is generally found near them, growing on exposed outcrops of acidic rock. While A. × trudellii is triploid and sterile, there is some evidence that it can occasionally reproduce apogamously.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid fern thrives in consistently moist, humid conditions with low to medium indirect light, mimicking its native shaded, rocky habitats. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging and fertilize sparingly during active growth for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer. Does not require heavy feeding.
