## 🌱 Overview
Gaillardia  (common name blanket flower) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, native to North and South America. It was named after Maître Gaillard de Charentonneau, an 18th-century French magistrate who was an enthusiastic botanist. The common name may refer to the resemblance of the inflorescence to the brightly patterned blankets made by Native Americans, or to the ability of wild taxa to blanket the ground with colonies. Many cultivars have been bred for ornamental use.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in full sun, the Onion Blanketflower is a resilient, drought-tolerant plant perfectly suited for arid conditions. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to completely dry out, and benefits from minimal fertilization. This makes it an excellent choice for low-maintenance, water-wise gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; native soils are often lean. A single light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or none at all if planted in moderately fertile soil.
