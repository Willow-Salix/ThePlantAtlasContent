| **🌡️ Climate** | Boreal Wetlands/Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to bright indirect light is essential for robust growth, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently wet to waterlogged soil conditions; it thrives in bog-like environments and should never be allowed to dry out. May tolerate standing water. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Red Cottongrass needs full sun and perpetually wet, acidic soil to mimic its native bog and tundra environment. Ensure constant moisture, potentially by keeping roots submerged, and apply fertilizer very sparingly due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a highly diluted solution formulated for bog plants or acid-loving plants, as its native soils are typically nutrient-poor.
