| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Chihuahuan Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering can be detrimental. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established. It tolerates dry conditions well and has very low fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance option for arid landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils, it generally does not require much fertilizer. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all, is sufficient.
