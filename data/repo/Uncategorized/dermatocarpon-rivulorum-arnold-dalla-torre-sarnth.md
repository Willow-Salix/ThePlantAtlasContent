## 🌱 Overview
Dermatocarpon is a genus of lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. Members of the genus are commonly called stippleback lichens because they have fruiting structures called perithecia that are flask-shaped structures embedded in the nonfruiting body (thallus), with a hole in the top to release spores, causing an appearance of being covered with small black dots. Its species are told apart chiefly by spore size, the colour and texture of the lower surface, and whether the epinecral layer gives a pruinose bloom.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Silverskin Lichen is an aquatic species needing constant access to clear, fresh water, either submerged or kept continuously saturated. It thrives in bright indirect light to partial shade and does not require fertilization. Maintaining a consistently wet environment is paramount for its survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens acquire nutrients from the air and water; artificial fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
