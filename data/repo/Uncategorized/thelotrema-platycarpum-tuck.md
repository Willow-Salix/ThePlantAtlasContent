## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia) and parts of Central America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect to dappled light, mimicking forest understory conditions. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and frequent moisture exposure (e.g., misting, high atmospheric humidity) as it absorbs water directly from the air and surfaces. Does not require soil watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Thelotrema is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Graphidaceae, the family to which all taxa in the former Thelotremataceae now belong.
Members of the genus Thelotrema are commonly called barnacle lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide a consistently humid environment with indirect or dappled light, replicating its native forest understory conditions. Do not use conventional fertilizers, as lichens absorb moisture and nutrients directly from the air and substrate, making them sensitive to chemical inputs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain necessary trace nutrients from air and rainfall; chemical fertilizers are often detrimental.
