## 🌱 Overview
Mespilus, commonly called medlar, is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae containing the single species Mespilus germanica of southwest Asia. It is also found in some countries in the Balkans, especially in Albanian, Macedonian and Bulgarian regions, and in Azerbaijan and Caucasian Georgia. A second proposed species, Mespilus canescens, discovered in North America in 1990, proved to be a hybrid between M. germanica and one or more species of hawthorn, and is properly known as × Crataemespilus canescens.

An annual application of balanced organic fertilizer or compost will support its growth. Ensure well-drained soil to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
