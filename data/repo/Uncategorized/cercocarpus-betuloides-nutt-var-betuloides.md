## 🌱 Overview
Cercocarpus, commonly known as mountain mahogany, is a small genus of at least nine species of nitrogen-fixing flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae. They are native to the western United States and northern Mexico, where they grow in chaparral and semidesert habitats and climates, often at high altitudes. Several are found in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion.

 
The classification of Cercocarpus within the Rosaceae has been unclear. The genus has been placed in the subfamily Rosoideae, but is now placed in subfamily Dryadoideae.
Members of the genus are deciduous shrubs or small trees, typically reaching heights of 3–6 m (9–18 ft) tall, but exceptionally up to 13 m (40 ft) high. C. montanus usually remains under 1 m (3 ft) high because of incessant grazing by elk and deer.
The name is derived from the Greek words κέρκος (kerkos), meaning "tail" and καρπός (karpos), meaning "fruit".  It refers to the tail-like plume on the fruits.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native dry woodland and chaparral habitats. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and needs minimal supplemental watering. Avoid heavy fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in lean to average soils; excessive fertilization can be harmful.
