## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western Europe, particularly oceanic and montane regions like the British Isles, France, Spain, and Portugal. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Oceanic, often humid, characterized by regular rainfall, fog, or high atmospheric moisture. |
| **☀️ Light** | Moderate to bright indirect light, or filtered sun. While found on exposed rocks, it benefits from high humidity and can be sensitive to prolonged, intense, dry direct sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Frequent atmospheric moisture is crucial for this lichen. This can be provided by high ambient humidity, regular misting, or placement in an environment with consistent moisture (e.g., terrarium-like conditions if grown indoors). |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This saxicolous lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with moderate to bright indirect light, typical of its native Western European coastal and montane habitats. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture for hydration and should never be fertilized. Optimal conditions mimic a perpetually damp, well-lit rock surface.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens do not require traditional fertilization as they absorb nutrients from the air, rain, and substrate. Introducing fertilizers can be detrimental.
