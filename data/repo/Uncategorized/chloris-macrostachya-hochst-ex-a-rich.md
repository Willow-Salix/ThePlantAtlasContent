## 🌱 Overview
In Greek mythology, the name Chloris (; Greek Χλωρίς Chlōrís, from χλωρός chlōrós, meaning "greenish-yellow", "pale green", "pale", "pallid", or "fresh") appears in a variety of contexts. Some clearly refer to different characters; other stories may refer to the same Chloris, but disagree on details.

Chloris, a nymph loved by Zephyrus (West Wind).
Chloris, wife of Neleus, king of Pylos. It is, however, not always clear whether she or the below Chloris is mentioned in this role.
Chloris, one of the Niobids.
Chloris, daughter of Orchomenus, married the seer Ampyx (son of Elatus or Titairon), with whom she had a child Mopsus who also became a renowned seer and would later join the Argonauts. The Argonautica Orphica calls her by a different name, Aregonis. In some accounts, she mothered Mopsus by Zeus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This semi-arid grassland native thrives in full sun and requires infrequent, deep watering with excellent drainage, as it is drought tolerant. It has low fertilizer needs. Mimicking its natural environment with ample light and well-draining soil is key to its care.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year during the active growing season, or not at all if the soil is reasonably fertile.
