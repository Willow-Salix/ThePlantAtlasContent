## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Louisiana), Caribbean, Central and South America (e.g., Brazil) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Humid Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect light to partial shade, mimicking its natural habitat on tree bark under a canopy. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity is crucial. This lichen thrives in environments with frequent rainfall and consistently high atmospheric moisture. Regular misting or placement in a humid environment (e.g., terrarium) is essential; it absorbs water directly from the air. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lithothelium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Pyrenulaceae. Most of the species are found in tropical climates, and are usually  corticolous (bark-dwelling) or saxicolous (rock-dwelling). These lichens form thin, crust-like layers that are often embedded within their substrate and are characterized by distinctive black, flask-shaped reproductive structures that may occur individually or in fused clusters with small openings for spore release. Established as a genus in 1885 by the Swiss botanist Johannes Müller Argoviensis, Lithothelium species can be distinguished from similar lichens by their rounded spore compartments and the presence of specialized structures called ocular chambers that assist in spore discharge.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This crustose lichen requires a consistently humid environment with indirect light, mimicking its native tropical and subtropical forest habitats. Ensure high atmospheric moisture through regular misting or enclosure, and avoid any direct fertilization as it is highly sensitive to nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No direct fertilization is needed or recommended. Lichens derive necessary nutrients from the air, rainfall, and trace elements from their substrate. Standard fertilizers can be detrimental.
