## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical shrub thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native habitat in open, sunny regions. It requires consistent moisture during its active growth, adapting to its tropical wet/dry climate by tolerating brief dry spells. Light fertilization supports its vigorous growth and characteristic powderpuff blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so high-nitrogen fertilizers are often not essential.
