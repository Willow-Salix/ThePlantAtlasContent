## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cape aloe thrives in bright, direct sunlight and requires minimal watering, allowing its soil to dry out thoroughly between applications. Mimicking its native arid to semi-arid scrubland habitat, it prefers lean soil and infrequent feeding, making it a low-maintenance succulent suitable for dry, sunny conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization; use a diluted, balanced succulent fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer) in lean soils.
