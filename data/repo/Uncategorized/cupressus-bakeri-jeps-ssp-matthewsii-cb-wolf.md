## 🧤 Care Instructions
Baker Cypress is a drought-tolerant conifer that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Mimicking its native dry, rocky habitats, it requires minimal watering once established and generally needs little to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; thrives in nutrient-poor soils. A light, balanced application annually in spring is sufficient if desired.
