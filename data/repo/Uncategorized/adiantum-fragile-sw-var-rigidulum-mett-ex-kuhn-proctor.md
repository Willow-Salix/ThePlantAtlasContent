## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | West Indies (Caribbean), including Jamaica, Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and parts of Central and South America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Mimicking its natural understory habitat, it should be protected from direct sunlight, which can scorch its delicate fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the soil consistently moist but never waterlogged. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels slightly dry. High humidity is essential, reflecting its native rainforest environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Adiantum (), the maidenhair fern (not to be confused with the similar-looking maidenhair spleenwort fern), is a genus of about 250 species of ferns in the subfamily Vittarioideae of the family Pteridaceae, though some researchers place it in its own family, Adiantaceae. The genus name comes from Greek, meaning "unwetted", referring to the fronds' ability to shed water without becoming wet.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Fragile Maidenhair requires a humid environment, consistently moist soil (never soggy), and bright, indirect light to mimic its tropical forest floor origins. Avoid direct sun and ensure adequate humidity to prevent its delicate fronds from drying out.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize lightly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a diluted liquid fertilizer, about once every 4-6 weeks. Ferns are not heavy feeders and can be sensitive to over-fertilization.
