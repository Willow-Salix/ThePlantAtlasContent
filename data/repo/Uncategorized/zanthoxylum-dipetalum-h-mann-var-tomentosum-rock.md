## 🌱 Overview
Zanthoxylum dipetalum is a rare species of tree in the family Rutaceae and in the same genus as Sichuan pepper. It is known by the Hawaiian names kāwa'u and aʻe. It is endemic to the Hawaiian archipelago, where it grows in forests on four of the islands.
There are two varieties.

Z. d. var. dipetalum is present on Kauaʻi, in the mountains of Oʻahu, on Hawaiʻi in Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park, and possibly on Molokaʻi.
Z. d. var. tomentosum is known from fewer than 30 individuals on Hualālai volcano on Hawaiʻi. This variety is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.
The roots of Z. dipetalum have been found to contain several chemical compounds, including canthin-6-one, chelerythrine, nitidine, tembetarine, avicennol, xanthoxyletin, lupeol, hesperidin, sitosterol, and magnoflorine.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Kawa'u thrives in conditions mimicking its native Hawaiian dry to mesic forests. Provide bright indirect light to partial sun and ensure well-draining soil, allowing it to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize moderately during its active growth periods to support healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release or diluted liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer).
