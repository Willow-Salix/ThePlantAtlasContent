## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Heartleaf Willow thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, replicating its natural riparian environment. Provide moderate fertilization to support its robust growth. This plant is well-suited for wet areas or near water features.
