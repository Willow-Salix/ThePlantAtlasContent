## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions with excellent air circulation. It needs periodic wetting and drying cycles, similar to natural rainfall patterns, and no supplemental fertilization. Avoid prolonged dampness and high nutrient environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No external fertilization is required; lichens obtain sufficient nutrients from atmospheric dust and rainfall. High nutrient concentrations can be detrimental.
