| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern and central United States (from New York south to Florida, and west to Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate and Humid Subtropical Grasslands, Moist Meadows, and Open Woodlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sun daily for best flowering) |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist soil, especially during dry periods; typically found in naturally moist to wet-mesic sites, so avoid letting soil dry out completely, but ensure good drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Vernonia is a genus of about 350 species of forbs and shrubs in the family Asteraceae. Some species of this genus are known as ironweeds. Some species are edible and of economic value. They are known for having intense purple flowers. There have been numerous distinct subgenera and subsections named in this genus, and some botanists have divided the genus into several distinct genera. For instance, the Flora of North America recognizes only about twenty species in Vernonia sensu stricto, seventeen of which are in North America north of Mexico, with the others being found in South America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Giant Ironweed thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native habitat in humid subtropical and temperate regions. This low-maintenance plant requires regular watering, particularly in dry periods, but generally needs minimal fertilization to produce its vibrant purple blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring is optional but often not strictly necessary in average garden soil as it adapts well to various conditions.
