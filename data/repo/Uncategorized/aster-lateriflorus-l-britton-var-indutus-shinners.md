## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Eastern North America, particularly the south-central United States (e.g., Texas) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate (Humid Continental to Subtropical), found in woodland edges, open fields, prairies, and moist streambanks. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial sun to full sun (4-8+ hours of direct sunlight daily). Tolerates more sun in cooler climates or with consistent moisture. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is preferred, especially during establishment and dry periods, but it tolerates some drought once mature. Ensure well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Symphyotrichum lateriflorum (formerly Aster lateriflorus) is a species of flowering plant in the aster family (Asteraceae). Commonly known as calico aster, starved aster, and white woodland aster, it is native to eastern and central North America. It is a perennial and herbaceous plant that may reach heights up to 120 centimeters (4 feet) and widths up to 30 centimeters (1 foot).
The flowers of calico aster are small compared to most Symphyotrichum species. They have an average of 7–15 short white ray florets, which are rarely tinted pink or purple. The flower centers, composed of disk florets, begin as cream to yellow and often become pink, purple, or brown as they mature. There are roughly 8–16 disk florets, each with five lobes that strongly reflex (bend backwards) when open. The mostly hairless leaves have a characteristic hairy midrib on their back faces, and branching is usually horizontal or in what can appear to be a zigzag pattern. Flower heads grow along one side of the branches and sometimes in clusters at the ends.
Symphyotrichum lateriflorum is a conservationally secure species and grows in a variety of habitats. It can be found throughout most of the eastern and east-central United States and Canada. There is also a native population in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Its late-summer and fall appearing flowers are visited by small pollinators and nectar-seeking insects such as sweat bees, miner bees, and hoverflies. As well as occurring naturally in several varieties, S. lateriflorum has multiple cultivars and has been grown for at least 250 years in Europe. Some modern-day cultivars are 'Bleke Bet', 'Lady in Black', and 'Prince'. It has been used by Indigenous peoples of the Americas as a medicinal plant.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Calico Aster thrives in a temperate climate with partial to full sun exposure. It prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil but is adaptable to various conditions and does not require heavy fertilization. Overall, it is a relatively low-maintenance plant, tolerant of a range of conditions once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally low to moderate fertility needs. An annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial in poor soils, but often not strictly necessary.
