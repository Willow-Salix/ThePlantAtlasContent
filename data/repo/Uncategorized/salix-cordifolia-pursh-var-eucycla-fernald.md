| **🌍 Origin** | Northeastern North America (specifically subarctic regions of Canada like Quebec, Labrador, Newfoundland) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subarctic Tundra / Boreal Wetlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, as it naturally grows in open bogs, fens, and wet meadows without significant tree cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently wet to very moist soil; it thrives in boggy or perpetually damp conditions and requires high water availability. |

## 🌱 Overview
Salix cordata, the sand dune willow, furry willow, or heartleaf willow, is a perennial shrub that grows 3 to 12 feet (0.91 to 3.66 m) tall; plants taller than 6 feet (1.8 m) are rare. The plant is native to the northeast regions of the North American continent; it is found on sand dunes, river banks, and lake shores in sandy, silty or gravelly soils.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This willow variety thrives in very cold, subarctic conditions, requiring consistently wet to saturated soil and full to partial sun exposure. Emulate its native bog and wetland environment by ensuring constant moisture and providing minimal fertilizer to prevent nutrient overload.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as its native peaty and often acidic soils are typically not rich in nutrients. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
