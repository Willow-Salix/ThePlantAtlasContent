## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Utah) and Northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun; requires at least 6-8 hours of direct, intense sunlight daily. Thrives in highly exposed locations. |
| **💧 Water** | Low; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Significantly reduce or cease watering during winter dormancy to prevent rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cylindropuntia imbricata, the cane cholla (walking stick cholla, tree cholla, or chainlink cactus), is a cactus found in the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico, including some cooler regions in comparison to many other cacti. It occurs primarily in the arid regions of the Southwestern United States in the states of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada. It is often conspicuous because of its shrubby or even tree-like size, its silhouette, and its long-lasting yellowish fruits.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient desert cactus thrives in full, direct sun exposure, mimicking its arid native environment. It requires infrequent watering, with soil allowed to dry out completely between sessions to prevent root rot, and very minimal fertilization. Overall, it is a low-maintenance plant perfectly suited for bright, dry conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; native soils are typically poor. A dilute, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer), or repotting into fresh substrate may suffice.
