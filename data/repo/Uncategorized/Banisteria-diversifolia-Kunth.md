# Stigmaphyllon Diversifolium
### *Banisteria diversifolia Kunth*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mexico, Central America, northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil), and the Caribbean islands |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forests, often found at forest edges or in clearings |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. It thrives with ample light but can be scorched by intense, unfiltered midday sun in very hot climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is key. Water regularly to keep the soil consistently moist but never waterlogged, allowing the top inch to dry slightly between waterings. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical vine thrives in bright, indirect light to partial sun conditions, mimicking its native habitat at forest edges. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from regular feeding during its growing period to ensure healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during its active growing season (spring and summer) will support vigorous growth.
