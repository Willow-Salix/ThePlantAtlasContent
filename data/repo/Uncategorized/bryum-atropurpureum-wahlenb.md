## 🌱 Overview
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This widespread temperate moss thrives in bright indirect light to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining conditions. It requires minimal fertilization, drawing most nutrients from its environment, making it a relatively low-maintenance addition to terrariums or shaded outdoor areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses are not heavy feeders and can derive sufficient nutrients from their substrate and environment. If desired, apply a very dilute (1/8 to 1/4 strength) balanced liquid fertilizer once or twice during the growing season.
