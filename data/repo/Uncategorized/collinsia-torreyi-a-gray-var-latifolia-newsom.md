## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California and Nevada, USA (Sierra Nevada and adjacent ranges) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane Temperate Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial sun to dappled shade; can tolerate full sun in cooler, high-elevation springs. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is crucial during its active growth in spring; allow the top soil to dry slightly between waterings. Reduce watering significantly or cease as the plant naturally declines in summer. |

## 🌱 Overview
Collinsia is a genus of about 20 species of annual flowering plants, consisting of the blue eyed Marys and the Chinese houses.  It was traditionally placed in the snapdragon family Scrophulariaceae, but following recent research in molecular genetics, it has now been placed in a much enlarged family Plantaginaceae.
The genus is endemic to North America, and is named in honor of Zacchaeus Collins, a Philadelphia botanist of the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century. Many of the 20 species may be found in California.
Two species, Collinsia parviflora (smallflower blue eyed Mary) and Collinsia violacea (violet blue eyed Mary), had medicinal uses among American Indian peoples.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As an annual wildflower, Torrey's Blue Eyed Mary thrives in spring with consistent moisture and partial sun or dappled shade, particularly in its natural montane temperate woodland habitat. It requires well-draining soil and generally needs low fertilization, completing its life cycle before the dry heat of summer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils. A single, light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial but is often not necessary.
