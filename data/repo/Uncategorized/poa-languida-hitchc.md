## 🌱 Overview
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Languid Bluegrass thrives in the temperate montane/subalpine climates of western North America. It prefers partial to full sun exposure and requires moderate, consistent moisture during its spring and early summer growth, with minimal fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low, as it is adapted to natural soil fertility. Supplemental light, balanced fertilizer may be beneficial in very poor soils during spring.
