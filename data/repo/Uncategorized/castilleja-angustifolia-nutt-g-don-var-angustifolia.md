## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hemiparasitic plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native Western North American meadows and steppes. It requires moderate to low watering, tolerating dry periods but not consistently wet conditions, and benefits from minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean, unfertilized soils. Avoid rich fertilizers, especially considering its hemiparasitic nature.
