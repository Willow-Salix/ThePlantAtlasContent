## 🌱 Overview
Ligularia (leopard plant) is a genus of Old World herbaceous perennial plants in the groundsel tribe within the sunflower family. They have yellow or orange composite flower heads with brown or yellow central disc florets, and are native to damp habitats mostly in central and eastern Asia, with a few species from Europe. There are about 120 to 140 species in the genus, and over half are endemic to China. The name Ligularia, from the Latin for "strap", refers to the shape of the ray florets.
Some species and cultivars are cultivated as ornamentals.  Ligularia dentata ‘Britt Marie Crawford’  Ligularia x hessei (Ligularia dentata x Ligularia wilsoniana) 'Gregynog Gold' and Ligularia przewalskii 'The Rocket' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. They are best grown in fertile, moist soil and full sun, with some shade at midday.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Summer Ragwort thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil and prefers partial to full shade, especially protection from hot afternoon sun. Regular watering is crucial to prevent the soil from drying out, and it benefits from routine feeding during its active growth period to support its lush foliage and vibrant flowers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer applied every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring to mid-summer) to support vigorous growth.
