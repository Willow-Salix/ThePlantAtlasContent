## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Coastal Mediterranean (characterized by frequent fog and mild temperatures) |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. Benefits from morning sun or filtered light to avoid intense afternoon exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | High atmospheric humidity and regular misting are critical, mimicking its reliance on fog and rainfall. Direct watering of a substrate is not applicable, as it absorbs moisture from the air and surface deposition. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dendrographa is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Roccellaceae. It has seven species. These lichens form small, shrubby tufts that cling to bark or coastal rocks along the Pacific seaboard, with brown-grey main branches and paler, pencil-thin tips that lack a protective outer skin. The genus was originally established in 1895 for a single Pacific coast species, but molecular studies in the 2010s expanded it by transferring four additional species from other genera and led to the discovery of a seventh species in Brazil.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in high atmospheric humidity and bright, indirect light, replicating its native coastal fog belt environment. It requires no soil or traditional watering, relying instead on consistent aerial moisture and occasional misting for hydration and nutrient acquisition.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. This lichen obtains all necessary nutrients directly from the air and its substrate (e.g., rock or bark).
