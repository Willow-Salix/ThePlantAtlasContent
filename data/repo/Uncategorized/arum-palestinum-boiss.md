## 🧤 Care Instructions
Solomon's Lily thrives with bright indirect to partial sun and consistent moisture during its active growing season from fall to spring. It requires a distinct dry dormancy period through the summer months, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. This ensures proper rest and prepares the plant for renewed growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during active growth. Do not fertilize during dormancy.
