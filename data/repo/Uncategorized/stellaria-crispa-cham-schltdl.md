## 🧤 Care Instructions
Curled Starwort thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, emulating its temperate forest understory origins. Maintain consistently damp soil and provide protection from direct, intense sunlight to ensure healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer or well-rotted compost can be applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season, as it thrives in naturally rich forest soils.
