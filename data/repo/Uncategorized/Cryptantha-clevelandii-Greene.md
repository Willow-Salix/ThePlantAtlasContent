## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland / Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to seasonal rainfall, preferring dry conditions during dormant periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cleveland's Cryptantha thrives in conditions mimicking its native Southern California scrublands, requiring full sun and very infrequent watering once established. It prefers well-draining, nutrient-poor soil and generally does not need fertilizer. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially mimicking its natural dry dormancy period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils characteristic of its native scrubland environment.
