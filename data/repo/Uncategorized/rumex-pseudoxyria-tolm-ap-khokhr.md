## 🌱 Overview
The docks and sorrels, genus Rumex, are a genus of about 200 species of annual, biennial, and perennial herbs in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae.
Members of this genus are very common perennial herbs with a native almost worldwide distribution, and introduced species growing in the few places where the genus is not native.
Some are nuisance weeds (and are sometimes called dockweed or dock weed), but some are grown for their edible leaves. Rumex species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species, and are the only host plants of Lycaena dispar and Lycaena rubidus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy Arctic plant requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, especially in its short growing season, and thrives in full to partial sun exposure. Given its adaptation to nutrient-poor tundra soils, very little or no fertilization is necessary for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; minimal to no fertilization needed, adapted to nutrient-poor soils
