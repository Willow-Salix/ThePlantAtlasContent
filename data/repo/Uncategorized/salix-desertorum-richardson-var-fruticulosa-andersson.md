## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-Arid Riparian and Montane Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats within desert and semi-arid regions. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, particularly when young, reflecting its preference for riparian zones. Once established, it can tolerate periods of drought but performs best with moderate, regular watering, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings; avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native riparian habitats within semi-arid regions. While tolerant of some drought once established, regular watering promotes best growth. Fertilize sparingly.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied once annually in early spring, or incorporate organic compost. Over-fertilization should be avoided as it is adapted to lean soils.
