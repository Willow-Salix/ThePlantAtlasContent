# Monarch Fern
### *Phymatosaurus Pic. Serm., orth. var.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of the Old World, including Southeast Asia, Australia, and Pacific Islands like Hawaii and Fiji. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect bright light to partial shade, mimicking the dappled light of a rainforest understory. Avoid direct sunlight which can scorch fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep substrate consistently moist but never waterlogged. High humidity is crucial; regular misting, a pebble tray, or placement in a humid environment is highly beneficial. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fern thrives in high humidity and indirect light, characteristic of its native rainforest understory. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil and provide light fertilization during active growth to mimic its natural epiphytic or lithophytic nutrient intake from decaying organic matter.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a diluted liquid fertilizer. As an epiphyte/lithophyte, it is not a heavy feeder and can be sensitive to over-fertilization.
