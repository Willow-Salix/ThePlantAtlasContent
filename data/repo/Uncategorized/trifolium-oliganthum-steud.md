## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, primarily California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean climate (characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters), and temperate grasslands/open woodlands. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, exposed areas, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during its active growing season (spring), allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established or as it approaches dormancy in summer. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fewflower Clover thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-draining soil typical of its Mediterranean and temperate grassland native habitats. Water moderately during active growth, allowing soil to dry between waterings, and requires minimal fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen and generally thrives in moderately fertile to poor soils without much need for supplemental nitrogen fertilizer.
