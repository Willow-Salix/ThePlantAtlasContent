# Nodding Pogonia
### *Triphora yucatanensis auct. non Ames*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida and Georgia), various Caribbean islands (e.g., Cuba, Bahamas, Jamaica), Mexico, and Central America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Moist Forests and Hammocks |
| **☀️ Light** | Low light to deep shade. As a terrestrial orchid of the forest understory, it thrives in dappled sunlight or indirect light, requiring protection from any direct sun exposure which can cause scorching. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture. The substrate should be kept evenly moist but never waterlogged. High ambient humidity is crucial, mimicking its native habitat on humid forest floors. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This delicate terrestrial orchid requires conditions that closely replicate its native subtropical to tropical forest floor: deep shade, high humidity, and consistently moist, organic-rich soil. It is essential to ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot while maintaining stable, warm temperatures.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. In its natural environment, it obtains nutrients from decaying organic matter. A very dilute, balanced orchid-specific fertilizer can be applied sparingly during periods of active growth, or regular additions of organic compost to the substrate.
