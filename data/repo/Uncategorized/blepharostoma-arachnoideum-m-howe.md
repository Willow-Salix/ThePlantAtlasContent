| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal and Cool Temperate regions, including North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Alaska, Canada), Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Forests or Subalpine/Alpine zones, characterized by high humidity, cool temperatures, and often dense shade from forest canopy or rock formations. |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low light to deep shade. It thrives in dimly lit, indirect light conditions, mimicking the forest floor or sheltered rock crevices. Direct sun is harmful. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires constant moisture and very high humidity. Substrate should remain consistently damp but not waterlogged. Misting frequently or growing in a terrarium/paludarium environment is ideal. Never allow it to dry out. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This delicate liverwort thrives in cool, constantly moist, and highly humid environments with very low light, mimicking its native forest floor habitat. It requires consistently damp substrate and is extremely sensitive to drying out and high nutrient concentrations.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low. Bryophytes are sensitive to high nutrient levels. If any, use a very dilute solution of a balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly, perhaps once or twice a year, or rely on nutrient cycling in a terrarium setup.
