## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (endemic) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Dry Shrubland / Coastal Dry Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, thriving in direct, intense light. Can tolerate some partial shade but may become leggy. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent to moderate watering. Highly drought-tolerant once established, preferring soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dodonaea, commonly known as hop-bushes, is a genus of about 70 species of flowering plants in the soapberry family, Sapindaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate regions of Africa, the Americas, southern Asia and Australasia, but 59 species are endemic to Australia.
Plants in the genus Dodonaea are shrubs or small trees and often have sticky foliage, with simple or pinnate leaves arranged alternately along the stems. The flowers are male, female or bisexual and are borne in leaf axils or on the ends of branchlets and lack petals. The fruit is an angled or winged capsule.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient Hawaiian native thrives in full sun and is exceptionally drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established. Plant in well-draining soil and avoid over-fertilization, mimicking its natural habitat on dry, exposed slopes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Native to nutrient-poor volcanic soils, it does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, if desired, is sufficient.
