## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal regions of Western North America (e.g., British Columbia, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California), parts of Europe (e.g., Norway, UK, Ireland), and Japan. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool, humid oceanic climate, often found in coastal temperate rainforests or maritime zones characterized by frequent fog and rainfall. |
| **☀️ Light** | Thrives in moderate to low light conditions, typically found in partial shade or filtered light, such as on tree bark or shaded rocks. Direct, intense sunlight should be avoided as it can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and frequent exposure to moisture from fog, dew, or rain. It does not require root watering like vascular plants; instead, it absorbs moisture directly from the air and surface. Periods of drying between wetting events are also important to prevent issues. |

## 🌱 Overview
Fuscopannaria is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Pannariaceae. It has about 50 species. The genus was established in 1994 by the Norwegian lichenologist Per Magnus Jørgensen to accommodate a group of squamulose and crustose lichens that are widespread across temperate and tropical regions. Members of the genus are typically found on tree bark in moist, shaded habitats, ranging from tropical rainforests to temperate woodlands, where they appear as small, greyish or dark crusty or scaly patches on trunks and branches.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in environments with consistently high humidity and cool temperatures, mimicking its native coastal temperate rainforest habitats. It requires moderate to low light and frequent moisture exposure from fog or rain, without direct fertilization which would be harmful.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required or recommended. Lichens are highly sensitive to external nutrients and pollution, deriving their needs from the environment. Fertilization would likely be detrimental.
