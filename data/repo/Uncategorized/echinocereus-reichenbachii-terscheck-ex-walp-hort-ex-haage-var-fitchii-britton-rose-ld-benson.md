## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South-central Texas, USA (e.g., Rio Grande Plains) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), mimicking its open desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent but thorough watering during the growing season (spring/summer), allowing soil to completely dry out between waterings. Very little to no water during dormancy (winter). |

## 🌱 Overview
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in full sun and requires very little water, especially in winter. Ensure well-draining soil and offer minimal fertilizer during its active growth period to mimic its arid native environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal. A dilute, low-nitrogen cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season.
