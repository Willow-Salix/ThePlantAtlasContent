## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central California Coast, USA (e.g., Monterey County) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (Chaparral, Coastal Scrub) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun is essential, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive in its native open habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; requires infrequent watering, especially during dry summer months, mimicking its native wet winter/dry summer climate. Avoid summer irrigation if possible. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ceanothus is a genus of about 50–60 species of nitrogen-fixing shrubs and small trees in the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae). Common names for members of this genus are buckbrush, California lilac, soap bush, or just ceanothus. "Ceanothus" comes from Ancient Greek: κεάνωθος (keánōthos), which was applied by Theophrastus (371–287 BC) to an Old World plant believed to be Cirsium arvense.
The genus is native to North America with the highest diversity on the western coast. Some species (e.g., C. americanus) are restricted to the eastern United States and southeast Canada, and others (e.g., C. caeruleus) extend as far south as Guatemala. Most are shrubs 0.5–3 metres (1.6–9.8 ft) tall, but C. arboreus and C. thyrsiflorus, both native to California, can be small multi-trunked trees up to 6–7 metres (20–23 ft) tall.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring a Mediterranean climate with dry summers. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal to no supplemental water or fertilizer, as it is adapted to poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally requires no fertilizer, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is a nitrogen-fixer. High phosphorus fertilizers can be detrimental.
