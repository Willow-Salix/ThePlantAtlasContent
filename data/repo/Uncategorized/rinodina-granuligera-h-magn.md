## 🧤 Care Instructions
This corticolous lichen thrives in cool, humid environments characteristic of temperate to boreal forests. Provide moderate, indirect light and ensure high ambient humidity with consistent atmospheric moisture, avoiding direct sun and chemical fertilizers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not typically required. Lichens absorb nutrients from the atmosphere and their substrate; traditional chemical fertilizers can be harmful.
