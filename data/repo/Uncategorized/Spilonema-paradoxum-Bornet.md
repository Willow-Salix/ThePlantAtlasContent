## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in humid temperate to subtropical regions across parts of Europe, North America, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Humid Forest Understory/Sheltered Microclimates |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate, indirect light. Requires significant shade and protection from direct sunlight, which can cause desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High ambient humidity is crucial. Requires consistent moisture, often from misting or a humid terrarium environment, but must not be waterlogged. Allow substrate to dry slightly between hydration events. |

## 🌱 Overview
Spilonema is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Coccocarpiaceae. These lichens form small, dark tufts of thread-like filaments that grow on rocks and are found in various regions from tropical to arctic climates. They partner with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, which gives them their distinctive blue-green colouration and allows them to survive in nutrient-poor environments. The genus was established in 1856 by the French botanist Jean-Baptiste Édouard Bornet, who distinguished these species from similar-looking lichens based on their unique internal structure.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in highly humid, shaded environments, mimicking its native forest understory habitat. It requires consistent moisture through high humidity and occasional wetting, along with protection from direct sunlight. No fertilization is needed, as it gathers nutrients from the air and rain.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain nutrients primarily from the atmosphere, rainfall, and their substrate; traditional fertilizers are harmful.
