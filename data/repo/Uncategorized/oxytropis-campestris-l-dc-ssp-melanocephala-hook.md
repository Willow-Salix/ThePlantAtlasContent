## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Pacific Northwest) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra/Subalpine Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open, high-altitude native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot, as it is adapted to rocky, well-drained alpine soils. |

## 🌱 Overview
Oxytropis is a genus of plants in the legume family. It includes over 600 species native to subarctic to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. It is one of three genera of plants known as locoweeds, and are notorious for being toxic to grazing animals. The other locoweed genus is the closely related Astragalus. Most oxtropis species are native to Eurasia and North America, but several species are native to the Arctic. These are hairy perennial plants which produce raceme inflorescences of pink, purple, white, or yellow flowers which are generally pea-like but have distinctive sharply beaked keels. The stems are leafless, the leaves being all basal. The plant produces legume pods containing the seeds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native high-altitude environment. Water moderately during its short growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization. It requires conditions that prevent waterlogging and excess nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nutrient needs; thrives in lean, well-drained soils. Avoid heavy fertilization, as this can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering. A very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial if soils are extremely poor.
