## 🌱 Overview
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This annual thrives by mimicking its native Californian vernal pool cycle, requiring consistent moisture and full sun during its active growth from late winter to spring. As temperatures rise and the plant finishes its lifecycle, allow the soil to dry completely, and it generally needs minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; over-fertilization can reduce flowering. Generally, a light application of balanced fertilizer during early growth is sufficient, or none if grown in suitable soil.
