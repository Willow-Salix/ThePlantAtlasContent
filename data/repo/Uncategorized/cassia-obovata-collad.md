## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North Africa (including Egypt, Sudan), Arabian Peninsula, and parts of India and Pakistan. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Semi-Arid Deserts |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure, ideally 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Highly drought-tolerant. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water sparingly and infrequently, especially during dormancy or cooler periods, to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Senna alexandrina (Alexandrian senna, in Arabic عشرج or عشرق or سنامكي and see below) is an ornamental plant in the genus Senna. It is used in herbalism. It grows natively in upper Egypt, especially in the Nubian region, and near Khartoum (Sudan), where it is cultivated commercially. It is also grown elsewhere, notably in India and Somalia.
Not native to the USSR, it was farmed in southern Kazakhstan for medicine.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Egyptian Senna is a low-maintenance plant thriving in conditions similar to its arid native environment. Provide abundant direct sunlight and infrequent watering, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between sessions. It requires very little fertilizer, making it suitable for xeriscaping or sunny, dry garden spots.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nutrient needs. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, with a diluted balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season (spring/summer). Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
