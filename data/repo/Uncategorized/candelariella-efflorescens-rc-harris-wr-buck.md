## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in environments mimicking temperate deciduous forests. Provide moderate indirect light, high humidity, and regular moisture through misting. Avoid traditional watering and fertilization, as lichens are sensitive to excess nutrients and can be harmed by them.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None required; lichens are sensitive to external nutrients and pollutants.
