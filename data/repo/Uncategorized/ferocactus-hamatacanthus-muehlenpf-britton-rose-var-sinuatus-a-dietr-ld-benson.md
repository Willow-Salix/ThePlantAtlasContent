## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for this desert cactus, provide abundant direct sunlight and ensure excellent drainage. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and use a very dilute fertilizer only during the warm growing season to support its slow growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Native desert soils are typically low in nutrients. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer once or twice during the growing season (spring to early summer) at half strength or less.
