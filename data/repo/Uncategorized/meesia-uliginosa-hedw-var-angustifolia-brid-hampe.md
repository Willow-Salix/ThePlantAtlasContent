## 🧤 Care Instructions
This circumboreal bog-moss thrives in cool, constantly wet, and often nutrient-poor environments. Provide bright indirect to moderate light, ensuring the substrate remains saturated and humidity is consistently high to mimic its native bog and tundra habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; if fertilized, use a very dilute, balanced solution sparingly.
