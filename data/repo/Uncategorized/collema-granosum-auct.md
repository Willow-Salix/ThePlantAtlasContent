## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Collema lichen thrives in temperate to Mediterranean conditions, typically found on calcareous rocks and requiring consistent moisture and good light. Provide frequent rehydration through misting or rain, ensuring the thallus remains moist while allowing for brief dry spells. Moderate to high indirect light is preferred, and no supplemental fertilizer is needed as it naturally absorbs nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No supplemental fertilizer is required; this lichen obtains all necessary nutrients from the air, rainwater, and its substrate.
