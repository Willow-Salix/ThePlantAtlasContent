## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America (from southern Canada to Florida, west to Texas and Oklahoma), parts of Central America and the Caribbean. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically moist woodlands, bogs, and swamps within this biome). |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to bright indirect light. Avoid direct midday sun which can scorch leaves, preferring dappled light mimicking a forest understory. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture. The growing medium should be kept evenly moist but never waterlogged, mimicking its boggy or swampy natural habitat. Water frequently, ensuring good drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This terrestrial orchid thrives in conditions that mimic its native moist, shaded woodland habitats of Eastern North America. Provide consistent moisture to the growing medium, bright indirect light, and a very dilute orchid fertilizer during its active growth period. Ensure good air circulation and drainage to prevent fungal issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder. Apply a highly dilute, balanced orchid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 to 1/8 strength) once every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Reduce or cease fertilization during dormancy.
