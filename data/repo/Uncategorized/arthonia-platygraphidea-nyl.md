## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen requires a consistently humid environment with low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native tropical rainforest habitat. Avoid direct sun and ensure high ambient humidity through misting or a terrarium setup. No traditional fertilizer is needed as lichens derive nutrients from the air and rain.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens do not absorb nutrients from soil like vascular plants. They obtain minimal nutrients from airborne dust and rain, thus traditional fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
