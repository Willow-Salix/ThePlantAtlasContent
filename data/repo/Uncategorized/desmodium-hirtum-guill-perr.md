## 🌱 Overview
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical African legume thrives in conditions mimicking its native savanna, preferring full sun to partial shade. Water moderately during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and reduce water during a dormant dry season. Fertilize lightly with a balanced feed, acknowledging its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season, especially given its nitrogen-fixing ability as a legume. Avoid over-fertilizing.
