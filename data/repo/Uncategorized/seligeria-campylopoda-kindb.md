## 🧤 Care Instructions
Small Limestone Moss thrives in cool, shaded environments with consistent moisture. Mimic its native cool temperate forest habitat by providing indirect light and maintaining damp (but not waterlogged) conditions on a suitable substrate. Fertilization needs are minimal, as it naturally draws nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; primarily absorbs nutrients from water and mineral-rich substrates like limestone, so heavy fertilization is unnecessary.
