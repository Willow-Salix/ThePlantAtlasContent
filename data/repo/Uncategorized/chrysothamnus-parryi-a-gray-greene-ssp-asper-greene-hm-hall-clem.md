## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert / Montane Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflective of its exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to very low; drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings, especially in winter. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chrysothamnus, known as rabbitbrush, rabbitbush, and chamisa, are a genus of shrubs in the family Asteraceae. The native distribution is in the arid western United States, Canada, and northern Mexico. It is known for its bright white or yellow flowers in late summer.
Chrysothamnus may grow up to a 120 cm (47 in) tall shrub or subshrub, usually with woody stem bases.  The leaves are alternate, sessile or with short petioles, with entire edges. The flowerheads are singular or in clusters. Each composite flower often has five to 6 (though sometimes upwards of 40) yellow disc florets and no ray florets.
Chrysothamnus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora linosyridella, Coleophora viscidiflorella (which have both been recorded on C. viscidiflorus) and Schinia walsinghami.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soil, requiring minimal water once established due to its arid native climate. Avoid overwatering and excessive fertilization to ensure healthy growth. It is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to harsh, exposed conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; adapted to poor to moderately fertile soils. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, or a very light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring if growth is poor.
