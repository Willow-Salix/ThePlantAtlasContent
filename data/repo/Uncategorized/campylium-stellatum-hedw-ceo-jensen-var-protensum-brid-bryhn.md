## 🧤 Care Instructions
This calciphilic moss requires consistently wet conditions and high humidity, thriving in full sun to partial shade similar to its native open fen habitats. Provide a calcium-rich substrate and minimal fertilization to maintain its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Benefits from a calcium-rich substrate. If grown in an artificial setup, a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly, but focus on mineral availability from the substrate rather than heavy feeding.
