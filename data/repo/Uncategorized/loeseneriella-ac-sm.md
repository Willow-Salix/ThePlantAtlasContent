## 🌱 Overview
Loeseneriella is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Celastraceae. The name is in honour of Ludwig Eduard Theodor Loesener (1865–1941), a German botanist who collected widely in the field in Germany and did much work on the Celastraceae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Loeseneriella thrives in conditions mirroring its tropical rainforest origin, requiring consistently moist, well-draining soil and high humidity. Provide bright, indirect light and moderate fertilization during its growth periods to encourage its vigorous, climbing habit.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring through summer). Reduce frequency in colder months.
