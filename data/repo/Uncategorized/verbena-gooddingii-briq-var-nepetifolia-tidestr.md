## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-native Verbena thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its arid origins. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and has very low fertilizer needs. Mimicking its natural environment ensures healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; native to lean desert soils. No fertilization is typically needed, or a very light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring if grown in poor soil.
