## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native thrives in full sun and very well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its coastal dune origins in a Mediterranean climate. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering, primarily during prolonged dry periods, and no supplemental fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils typical of its native habitat. Supplemental fertilizer is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
