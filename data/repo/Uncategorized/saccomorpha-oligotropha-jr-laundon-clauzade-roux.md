### *Saccomorpha oligotropha (J.R. Laundon) Clauzade & Roux*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western and Northern Europe (e.g., British Isles, Scandinavia, France, Germany) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Oceanic (found on exposed siliceous rocks in heathlands, uplands, and coastal areas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Moderate to High Sun (prefers exposed or semi-shaded conditions on rock surfaces) |
| **💧 Water** | Frequent moisture from rain, mist, or high humidity; requires excellent drainage and no standing water. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, temperate oceanic climates on exposed, nutrient-poor siliceous rocks. Provide moderate to high indirect light and ensure frequent moisture through misting or high humidity, avoiding any standing water. Do not fertilize, as it is adapted to oligotrophic environments and sensitive to excess nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None to very minimal; this lichen thrives in nutrient-poor (oligotrophic) environments and is sensitive to excess nutrients.
