## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (endemic to Kauai) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. In its native habitat, it can be found in open areas or forest margins, suggesting a preference for good light without constant intense, direct sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, but not waterlogged, soil, reflecting its wet forest origin. Water frequently, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly before rewatering, and ensure excellent drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dubautia or na'ena'e is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. The genus was named after Joseph Eugène DuBaut (1796–1832), an officer in the French Navy who participated in Freycinet's expedition.
The entire genus is endemic to Hawaii. It contains more species than the other two genera in the silversword alliance, including cushion plants, shrubs, trees, and lianas.

To successfully cultivate Dubautia coriacea, emulate its tropical wet forest environment. Provide bright indirect to partial sun exposure and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-draining. A light feeding regimen during the growing season will support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler, dormant periods.
