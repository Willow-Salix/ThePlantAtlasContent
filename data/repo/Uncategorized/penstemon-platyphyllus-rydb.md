## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (e.g., Colorado, Utah, Wyoming) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-arid Montane / Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun. Native to open, exposed slopes and sagebrush communities, indicating a strong preference for direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering is detrimental, especially in winter. |

## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Broadleaf Beardtongue thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its native habitat of arid Western US slopes. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization to prevent root rot and encourage healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in lean, well-draining soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. An annual light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all in good soil, is sufficient.
