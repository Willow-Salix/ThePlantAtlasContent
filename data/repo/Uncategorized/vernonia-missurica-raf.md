## 🌱 Overview
Vernonia is a genus of about 350 species of forbs and shrubs in the family Asteraceae. Some species of this genus are known as ironweeds. Some species are edible and of economic value. They are known for having intense purple flowers. There have been numerous distinct subgenera and subsections named in this genus, and some botanists have divided the genus into several distinct genera. For instance, the Flora of North America recognizes only about twenty species in Vernonia sensu stricto, seventeen of which are in North America north of Mexico, with the others being found in South America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Missouri ironweed thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native prairie and open woodland environments. It requires moderate watering and minimal fertilization once established, making it a relatively low-maintenance perennial suitable for sunny garden spots.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally does not require heavy fertilization in average garden soil. An annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be beneficial in very poor soils.
