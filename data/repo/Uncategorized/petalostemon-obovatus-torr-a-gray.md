## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South-Central and Southwestern United States (e.g., Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Arizona) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Semi-Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun exposure (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), typical of open prairie and scrubland habitats where it experiences high light intensity. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; prefers well-drained soil and infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking natural rainfall patterns of its native arid/semi-arid climate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dalea  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as prairie clover or indigo bush. Its name honors English apothecary Samuel Dale (1659–1739). They are native to the Western hemisphere, where they are distributed from Canada to Argentina. Nearly half of the known species are endemic to Mexico. Two species of Dalea (Dalea ornata and Dalea searlsiae) have been considered for rangeland restoration.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient prairie native thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil, exhibiting strong drought tolerance once established. Minimal watering and fertilizer are needed, making it an excellent low-maintenance plant for arid or semi-arid garden conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen, reducing the necessity for external nitrogen. A light application of a balanced, low-phosphorus fertilizer in spring is sufficient only if the soil is very poor, but often not required.
