## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Monsoon/Seasonal Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial shade; thrives with bright, direct light for several hours daily, mimicking its native habitat at forest margins or open, disturbed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture, especially during warm growing periods. Allow the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings, but avoid prolonged dryness or waterlogging due to high native rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Abrus is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, and the only genus in the tribe Abreae. It contains 13–18 species, but is best known for a single species: jequirity (A. precatorius). The highly toxic seeds of that species are used to make jewellery.
Species range naturally across tropical Africa, Madagascar, the Arabian Peninsula, south and southeast Asia, southern China, New Guinea, and Australia. Some species have been introduced to the tropical Americas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This vigorous tropical vine thrives in warm, humid conditions with ample bright light to partial shade, mirroring its native open habitats. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, allowing the top layer to dry between waterings, and provide regular balanced fertilization during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, reflecting the generally fertile soils and rapid growth in its native environment.
