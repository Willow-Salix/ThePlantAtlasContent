## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in bright light and requires consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native habitat in wet pine flatwoods. Fertilization should be light and infrequent due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor sandy soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; prefers infrequent fertilization with a balanced, slow-release or diluted liquid fertilizer, as native sandy soils are often nutrient-poor.
