## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sticky Currant is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub suited for full sun to partial shade in well-drained, lean soils. Once established, it requires minimal watering and fertilization, thriving with infrequent attention. This makes it ideal for xeriscaping or native plant gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
