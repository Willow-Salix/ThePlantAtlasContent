## 🧤 Care Instructions
Virginia Creeper is a robust and highly adaptable vine, thriving in conditions from full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering initially but becomes quite drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization is rarely necessary, making it an excellent low-maintenance plant for various landscape uses.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Generally not required in average to rich garden soils. If growth is poor in very lean soil, a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring.
