## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (specifically Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, particularly the Uinta Basin and surrounding high desert regions) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its exposure in open desert and scrubland environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, deep watering. Highly drought-tolerant once established; allow soil to dry completely between waterings, mimicking sparse rainfall patterns in arid regions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chrysothamnus, known as rabbitbrush, rabbitbush, and chamisa, are a genus of shrubs in the family Asteraceae. The native distribution is in the arid western United States, Canada, and northern Mexico. It is known for its bright white or yellow flowers in late summer.
Chrysothamnus may grow up to a 120 cm (47 in) tall shrub or subshrub, usually with woody stem bases.  The leaves are alternate, sessile or with short petioles, with entire edges. The flowerheads are singular or in clusters. Each composite flower often has five to 6 (though sometimes upwards of 40) yellow disc florets and no ray florets.
Chrysothamnus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora linosyridella, Coleophora viscidiflorella (which have both been recorded on C. viscidiflorus) and Schinia walsinghami.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native arid scrubland environment. Once established, it requires infrequent, deep watering and has low fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance option for xeriscaping.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils characteristic of desert environments; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
