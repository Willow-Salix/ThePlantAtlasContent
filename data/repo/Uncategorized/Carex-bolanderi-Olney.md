## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bolander's sedge thrives in cool, consistently moist environments, preferring partial shade but tolerating full sun if adequate moisture is maintained. It requires consistently wet soil and has low to moderate fertilizer needs, mimicking its native habitat along streambanks and in moist meadows.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none if grown in naturally rich, organic soil.
