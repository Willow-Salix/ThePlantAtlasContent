## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant cypress thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native Californian arid scrubland. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings, and fertilize very sparingly if at all, as it's adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, using a balanced slow-release formula in early spring.
