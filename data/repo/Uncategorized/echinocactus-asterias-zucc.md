## 🌱 Overview
Echinocactus is a genus of cacti in the subfamily Cactoideae. The generic name derives from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echînos), meaning "spiny," and cactus.  It and Ferocactus are the two genera of barrel cactus.  Members of the genus usually have heavy spination and relatively small flowers.  The fruits are copiously woolly, and this is one major distinction between Echinocactus and Ferocactus.  Propagation is by seed.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, allowing its soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings. Provide excellent drainage and infrequent, diluted fertilization during its active growth period to mimic its native arid conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; apply a diluted, balanced succulent fertilizer once or twice during the growing season (spring/summer).
