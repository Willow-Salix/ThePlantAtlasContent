## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Indian Sedge flourishes in conditions mimicking its tropical moist forest origin, requiring consistent soil moisture and high humidity. Provide partial shade to dappled sunlight, protecting it from intense direct sun. Fertilize moderately during its growth period to support healthy foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release or liquid fertilizer applied during the active growing season (spring to summer). Over-fertilization should be avoided.
