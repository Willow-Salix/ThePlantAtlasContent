## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Southern Florida, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Scrubland / Pine Flatwoods |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; requires well-drained soil and tolerates dry periods. Water regularly when young, then infrequently for mature plants, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Amorpha is a genus of plants in the pea family, Fabaceae. All the species are native to North America, from southern Canada, most of the United States (US), and northern Mexico. They are commonly known as false indigo. The name Amorpha means "deformed" or "without form" in Greek and was given because flowers of this genus only have one petal, unlike the usual "pea-shaped" flowers of the Faboideae subfamily. Amorpha is missing the wing and keel petals.
The desert false indigo or indigo bush (Amorpha fruticosa), is a shrub that grows from 3 m to 5 m tall. The species is considered a rare species in the US state of West Virginia and in the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, but is considered an invasive plant in some areas of the northeastern and northwestern United States and in southeastern Canada, beyond its native range, and has also been introduced into Europe.
The lead plant (Amorpha canescens), a bushy shrub, is an important North American prairie legume. Lead plant is often associated with little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), a common prairie grass. Native Americans used the dried leaves of lead plant for pipe smoking and tea.
Amorpha species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia lucens, which feeds exclusively on the genus.
Amorphol, a rotenoid bioside, can be isolated from plants of the genus Amorpha.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Clusterspike False Indigo thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its native scrubland and pine flatwoods habitat in Florida. Once established, it is highly drought tolerant and requires minimal supplemental watering. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, this plant generally has low fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen and naturally thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils; supplemental fertilizer is generally unnecessary.
