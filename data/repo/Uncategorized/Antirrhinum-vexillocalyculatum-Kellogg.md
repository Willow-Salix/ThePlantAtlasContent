## 🌱 Overview
Antirrhinum is a genus of plants in the Plantaginaceae family, commonly known as dragon flowers or snapdragons because of the flowers' fancied resemblance to the face of a dragon that opens and closes its mouth when laterally squeezed. They are also sometimes called toadflax or dog flower. They are native to rocky areas of Europe, the United States, Canada, and North Africa. Antirrhinum species are widely used as ornamental plants in borders and as cut flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native thrives in conditions similar to its Mediterranean scrubland home, favoring full sun and well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering during its active growing season and minimal water during summer dormancy. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Prefers lean, well-draining soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release formula, primarily in very poor soil conditions.
