## 🌱 Overview
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This montane plant thrives in cool, consistently moist, well-drained conditions, mimicking its subalpine origins. Provide bright indirect to partial sun, avoiding intense afternoon heat, and fertilize sparingly during its growing period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring to early summer).
