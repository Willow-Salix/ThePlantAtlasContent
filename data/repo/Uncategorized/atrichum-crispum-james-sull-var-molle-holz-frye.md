## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in environments mimicking its native moist temperate forest floor. Provide consistent low light, high humidity, and keep the substrate continuously moist. Fertilizer is rarely needed, as it prefers nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; mosses typically thrive in low-nutrient environments, absorbing what they need from rainfall and decaying organic matter. Avoid concentrated fertilizers.
