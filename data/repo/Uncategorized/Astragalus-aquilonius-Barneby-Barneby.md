## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Lemhi Milkvetch thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, characteristic of its arid scrubland origins. Provide infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely, and avoid excessive fertilization to best mimic its natural, drought-tolerant conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky or gravelly soils.
