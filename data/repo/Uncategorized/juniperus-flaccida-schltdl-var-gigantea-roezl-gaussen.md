## 🌱 Overview
Junipers are coniferous trees and shrubs in the genus Juniperus ( joo-NIP-ər-əs) of the cypress family Cupressaceae. Depending on the taxonomy, between 50 and 67 species of junipers are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere as far south as tropical Africa, as far north as the Arctic, and parts of Asia and Central America. The highest-known juniper forest occurs at an altitude of 4,900 metres (16,100 ft) in southeastern Tibet and the northern Himalayas, creating one of the highest tree lines on earth.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This juniper thrives in its native temperate montane conditions, preferring full sun and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is drought-tolerant once established, necessitating moderate watering that allows the soil to dry out between sessions, and benefits from minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly in early spring with a balanced, slow-release conifer fertilizer, or not at all if soil is adequately rich.
