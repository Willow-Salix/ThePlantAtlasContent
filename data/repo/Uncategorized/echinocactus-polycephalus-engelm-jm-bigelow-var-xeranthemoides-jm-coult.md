## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah) and Northwestern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Hot Desert / Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, replicating its open desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering is essential; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Mimic desert rainfall by providing a deep soak once every few weeks during warm growing periods and withholding water almost entirely in winter. |

## 🌱 Overview
Echinocactus is a genus of cacti in the subfamily Cactoideae. The generic name derives from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echînos), meaning "spiny," and cactus.  It and Ferocactus are the two genera of barrel cactus.  Members of the genus usually have heavy spination and relatively small flowers.  The fruits are copiously woolly, and this is one major distinction between Echinocactus and Ferocactus.  Propagation is by seed.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Cottontop Cactus thrives in conditions mimicking its native hot desert environment, demanding abundant direct sunlight and extremely infrequent watering. It prefers nutrient-poor soil, thus requiring very little to no fertilization. The key to care is providing intense light, allowing long dry periods between waterings, and ensuring excellent drainage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very minimal fertilization, if any. Desert soils are typically nutrient-poor, so a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season.
