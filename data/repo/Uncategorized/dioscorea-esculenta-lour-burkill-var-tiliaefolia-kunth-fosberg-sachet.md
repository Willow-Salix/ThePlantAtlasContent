## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical yam thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light to partial sun. It needs consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from regular fertilization during its growing period to encourage healthy tuber development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires regular feeding during its active growing season with a balanced fertilizer, potentially one higher in potassium to support tuber development, as it would access rich organic matter in its native tropical soils.
