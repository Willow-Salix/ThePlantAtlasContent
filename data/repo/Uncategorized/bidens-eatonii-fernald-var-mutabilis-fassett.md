## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northeastern United States (primarily New England, e.g., Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine) and adjacent southeastern Canada (e.g., Quebec, New Brunswick), specifically in tidal freshwater marshes and muddy river shores. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Riverine/Wetland Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, as it naturally grows in open, exposed riparian and marsh environments. |
| **💧 Water** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil, tolerating periodic inundation common in tidal freshwater habitats. Avoid allowing the soil to dry out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bidens is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. The genus include roughly 230 species which are distributed worldwide. Despite their global distribution, the systematics and taxonomy of the genus has been described as complicated and unorganized. The common names beggarticks, black jack, burr marigolds, cobbler's pegs, Spanish needles, stickseeds, tickseeds and tickseed sunflowers refer to the fruits of the plants, most of which are bristly and barbed. The generic name refers to the same character; Bidens comes from the Latin bi ("two") and dens ("tooth").
