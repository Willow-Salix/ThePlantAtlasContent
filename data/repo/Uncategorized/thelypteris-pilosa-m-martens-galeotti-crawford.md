## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests (often montane or cloud forests) |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light. Direct sunlight will scorch the fronds. Prefers dappled shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is key. Soil should be kept evenly moist but not waterlogged. High humidity is crucial, mimicking its native wet forest habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Thelypteris (maiden ferns) is a genus of ferns in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, family Thelypteridaceae, order Polypodiales. Two radically different circumscriptions of the genus are in use as of January 2020. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the genus is a very small one with about two species. In other approaches, the genus is the only one in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, and so includes between 875 and 1083 species.
The genus name is from Greek thēlys "female" and pteris "fern". However, "female fern" usually refers to the common lady-fern.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Softhairy Maiden Fern thrives in humid conditions with consistently moist soil and indirect light, replicating its native tropical understory environment. Ensure regular watering, maintain high ambient humidity, and apply a diluted fertilizer sparingly during active growth for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder. Use a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., half strength) once a month during the growing season (spring and summer). Over-fertilization can harm the plant.
