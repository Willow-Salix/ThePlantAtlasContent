## 🧤 Care Instructions
Western Wheatgrass is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its native prairie environment. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. This makes it ideal for xeriscaping and sustainable landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization. Excessive nutrients can lead to lush but weak growth.
