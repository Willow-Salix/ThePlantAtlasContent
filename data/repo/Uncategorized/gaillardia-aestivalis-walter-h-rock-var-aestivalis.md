## 🌱 Overview
Gaillardia  (common name blanket flower) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, native to North and South America. It was named after Maître Gaillard de Charentonneau, an 18th-century French magistrate who was an enthusiastic botanist. The common name may refer to the resemblance of the inflorescence to the brightly patterned blankets made by Native Americans, or to the ability of wild taxa to blanket the ground with colonies. Many cultivars have been bred for ornamental use.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lanceleaf blanketflower flourishes in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its origins in the open prairies and woodlands of the southeastern US. It prefers moderate watering, with soil allowed to dry between sessions, and requires minimal to no fertilization for optimal flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant thrives in average to poor, well-draining soils; excessive fertilization can lead to lush foliage at the expense of flowers.
