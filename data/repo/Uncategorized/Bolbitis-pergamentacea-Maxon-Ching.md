## 🌱 Overview
Bolbitis is a genus of ferns in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Elaphoglossoideae, in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I).
Two particular members of the genus are often grown as immersed water plants in aquaria, B. heudelotii, and B. heteroclita.  B. heudelotii, the African water fern, normally grows submerged in its native habitat, while B. heteroclita normally grows on the margin of water bodies, but will also grow submerged.
