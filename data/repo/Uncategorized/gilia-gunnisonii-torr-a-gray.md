## 🌱 Overview
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gunnison's Gilia thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid and semi-arid environments. Provide full sun exposure and ensure extremely well-draining soil, allowing it to dry out thoroughly between infrequent waterings. Fertilization is generally not required, aligning with its adaptation to nutrient-poor habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically does not require much fertilization. May benefit from a very light, balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season in extremely poor soils, but often not necessary.
