## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient evening primrose thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native grasslands. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and provide minimal fertilization to avoid leggy growth, as it's adapted to leaner conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to light fertilization; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in early spring, or none if planted in fertile soil.
