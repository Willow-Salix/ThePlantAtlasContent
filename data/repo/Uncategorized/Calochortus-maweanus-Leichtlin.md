## 🧤 Care Instructions
Maw's Mariposa Lily thrives in well-drained soil under full sun to partial shade, reflecting its native habitat in open areas of the Pacific Northwest. It requires consistent moisture during its active growing period from fall through spring, followed by a crucial dry dormancy throughout the summer. Over-fertilization should be avoided, as it is adapted to lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; these plants are adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils. A very light, balanced fertilizer might be applied once during active growth if necessary.
