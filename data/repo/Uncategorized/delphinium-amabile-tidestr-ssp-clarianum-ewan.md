## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern California, USA (Inner South Coast Ranges, South Coast Ranges) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Chaparral, Cismontane Woodland, Grassland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun for optimal flowering, but can tolerate partial shade, especially in hotter climates to protect from intense afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate watering during its active growth period in spring. Once established, it is drought-tolerant and prefers drier conditions during its summer dormancy, needing minimal to no supplemental water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun with well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. Provide moderate water during its spring growth, then allow it to dry out and enter dormancy in the summer. Fertilize lightly in spring for best results.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Native to soils that are not overly rich, so a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is usually sufficient. Avoid over-fertilizing, which can lead to leggy growth.
