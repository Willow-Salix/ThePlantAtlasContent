## 🧤 Care Instructions
Micheli's Bottlewort thrives in consistently moist conditions with high ambient humidity, requiring bright indirect light or partial shade. Ensure its substrate remains damp but never waterlogged, and protect it from harsh direct sun exposure. Due to its nature as a liverwort, fertilization is rarely needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very minimal to no fertilizer is typically required. If desired, a highly diluted (e.g., 1/4 strength) balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied very infrequently during active growth.
