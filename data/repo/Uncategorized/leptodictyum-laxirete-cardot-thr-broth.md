## 🧤 Care Instructions
This aquatic or semi-aquatic moss thrives in conditions mimicking its temperate to boreal wetland origins. Provide low light and ensure constant moisture, ideally by keeping it submerged or in a high-humidity environment, with minimal nutrient supplementation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Mosses have very low nutrient requirements, and excessive fertilization can be detrimental or promote algal growth.
