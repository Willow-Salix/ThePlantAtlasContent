## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma), Northern Mexico (Chihuahua) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane Woodland / Forest (often semi-arid to arid regions, frequently found in canyons and along riparian areas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Naturally found in exposed canyons and slopes, it tolerates full sun, especially in cooler parts of its range or higher elevations, but can appreciate afternoon shade in hot, arid climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate. It requires consistent moisture when young to establish a strong root system. Once established, it is quite drought-tolerant due to its adaptation to arid regions, but benefits from supplemental watering during prolonged dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Acer grandidentatum, commonly called bigtooth maple or western sugar maple, is a species of maple native to interior western North America. It occurs in scattered populations from western Montana to central Texas in the United States and south to Coahuila in northern Mexico.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bigtooth maple is a hardy tree that thrives in full sun to partial shade and exhibits good drought tolerance once established. It prefers well-draining soil and typically requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for landscapes in suitable climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to varied, often lean, mountain soils. Generally, it does not require heavy fertilization; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial in very poor soils.
