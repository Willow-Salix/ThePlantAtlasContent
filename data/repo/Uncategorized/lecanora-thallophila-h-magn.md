## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate and Boreal regions across Europe, North America, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forest and Alpine/Subalpine Rocky Habitats |
| **☀️ Light** | High light exposure, tolerant of direct sun found on exposed rock surfaces. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular atmospheric moisture (e.g., misting, high humidity, rainfall) for absorption, with intermittent dry periods mimicking natural wet/dry cycles. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in bright, open conditions, mimicking its natural habitat on exposed rocks or bark in temperate to boreal regions. It requires consistent atmospheric humidity or regular misting for moisture absorption, interspersed with periods of complete dryness. Fertilization is unnecessary and can be harmful, as lichens are highly sensitive to added nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None; lichens obtain nutrients from the air and rain, and are highly sensitive to nutrient enrichment which can be detrimental.
