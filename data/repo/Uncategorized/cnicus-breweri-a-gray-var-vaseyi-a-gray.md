## 🧤 Care Instructions
Vasey's Thistle thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean scrubland environment. It requires minimal watering once established due to its drought tolerance, especially during dry summer months. Fertilization is generally not needed as it adapts to lean soil conditions.
