# Aspilicia Diamarta
### *Aspilicia diamarta (Ach.) Boistel*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in temperate to alpine regions of Europe and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane to Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | High light to full sun exposure, as it thrives on open, exposed rock surfaces. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies on atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, humidity) for hydration; regular access to moisture is crucial, but it tolerates dry periods. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Aspilicia diamarta is a crustose lichen found on exposed siliceous rocks in well-lit, temperate to alpine environments. Its care involves providing high light exposure and ensuring consistent atmospheric moisture, as it absorbs water and nutrients directly from the air and rock surface. Traditional watering and fertilization methods are not applicable for this organism.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required, as lichens derive nutrients from the atmosphere and rock substrate.
