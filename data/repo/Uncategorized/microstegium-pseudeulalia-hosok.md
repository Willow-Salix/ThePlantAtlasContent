## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in consistently moist, shaded to partially shaded conditions, typical of its native Asian forest understory. It requires frequent watering to maintain damp soil and can manage with low to moderate fertilization. Its robust nature makes it an aggressive competitor in suitable environments.
