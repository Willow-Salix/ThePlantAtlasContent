## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Collins' Sedge requires a consistently wet environment, similar to its native bog and wetland habitats, and prefers partial to full shade. Ensure the soil never dries out and provide minimal, slow-release fertilization to mimic its natural conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly, particularly if grown in nutrient-poor wetland-mimicking substrates.
