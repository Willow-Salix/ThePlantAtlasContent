## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Siberia (Russia), Mongolia, parts of northern China, and Kazakhstan |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Boreal Forest (Taiga) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, as it thrives in open, exposed areas typical of its native habitat, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil; adequate water is crucial during its active growth period, especially considering its native climate has significant snowmelt and summer rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Larix sibirica, the Siberian larch or Russian larch, is a frost-hardy tree native to western Russia, from close to the Finnish border east to the Yenisei valley in central Siberia, where it hybridises with the Dahurian larch L. gmelinii of eastern Siberia; the hybrid is known as Larix × czekanowskii.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Siberian Larch, ensure it receives full sun exposure and is planted in well-drained, consistently moist soil. It is adapted to cold climates and relatively poor soils, so avoid over-fertilization. Protect young trees from extreme drought until established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to the relatively nutrient-poor, often acidic soils of boreal forests, so heavy fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
