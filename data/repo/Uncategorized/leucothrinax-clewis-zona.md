## 🌱 Overview
Leucothrinax morrisii, the Key thatch palm, is a small palm which is native to the Greater Antilles (except Jamaica), northern Lesser Antilles, The Bahamas and Florida and the Florida Keys in the United States.  
Until 2008 it was known as Thrinax morrisii.  It was split from the genus Thrinax after phylogenetic studies showed that its inclusion in Thrinax would render that genus paraphyletic.  The generic name combines leuco (in reference to the whitish colour of its flowering stalks and the undersides of its leaves) with thrinax.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The White Thatch Palm thrives in full to partial sun with moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It tolerates some drought and benefits from light to moderate feeding with a palm-specific fertilizer during its active growing period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced palm-specific fertilizer, particularly during the growing season, as native soils can be nutrient-poor.
