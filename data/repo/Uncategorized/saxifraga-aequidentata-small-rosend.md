## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal, including North America (Alaska, Canada, Western U.S. mountains, Appalachians), Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, and high elevation rocky stream banks. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun, especially in warmer climates. Can tolerate full sun in very cool, high-altitude environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking its native habitat near streams and snowmelt. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely, but avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This high-altitude plant thrives in consistently cool and moist environments, characteristic of alpine stream banks. Provide bright, indirect light or partial sun and maintain constantly damp soil, taking care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilize very sparingly during its short growing season.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization. A very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer applied once a month during the active growing season is sufficient.
