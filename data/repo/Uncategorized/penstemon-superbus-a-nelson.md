## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native arid scrubland and desert environment. Once established, provide infrequent, deep watering and avoid over-fertilization to ensure healthy growth and abundant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils; avoid rich soils or excessive nitrogen which can lead to leggy growth.
