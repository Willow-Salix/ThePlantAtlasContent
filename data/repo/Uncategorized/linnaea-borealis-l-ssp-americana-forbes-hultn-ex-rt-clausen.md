## 🧤 Care Instructions
Twinflower thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, replicating its native forest understory. Ensure consistently moist soil and provide partial to full shade to mimic its natural habitat. It appreciates organic-rich soil and may benefit from light, balanced fertilization in spring.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in nutrient-rich, organic soil; light fertilization with a balanced organic fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring if soil is poor.
