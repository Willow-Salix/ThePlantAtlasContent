## 🌱 Overview
Lessingia is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae which are native to western North America. Several species are endemic to California.
Lessingias are generally daisy-like in appearance with white, yellow, or purple flowers, but they vary in appearance. Some lessingias are sometimes treated as members of different genera, such as Benitoa. The San Francisco lessingia, Lessingia germanorum, is an endangered species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Valley Lessingia thrives in full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its native Mediterranean habitat. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, needing minimal water and no supplemental fertilizer. Provide conditions that mimic dry summer periods for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental if overdone.
