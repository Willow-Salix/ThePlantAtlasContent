## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, Symplocos requires conditions similar to its native tropical and subtropical forest habitats. Provide partial shade or dappled light, maintain consistently moist but well-drained soil, and fertilize moderately during the growing season to support its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer during the growing season. Its native forest soils are typically rich in decaying organic matter, suggesting a need for regular but not excessive nutrient replenishment.
