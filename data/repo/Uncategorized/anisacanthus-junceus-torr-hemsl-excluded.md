## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Texas, Arizona, New Mexico) and Northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native desert/scrubland environment, which is typically open and exposed. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Mimic sporadic desert rainfall, reducing water in cooler months. |

## 🌱 Overview
Anisacanthus is a genus of flowering plants in the bear's breeches family, Acanthaceae. The generic name is derived from the Greek words ἄνισος (ánisos), meaning "unequal," and ἄκανθος (ákanthos), meaning "spine, thorn." Members of the genus are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are commonly known as desert honeysuckles, though this term is shared with the genus Ancistranthus, and is something of a misnomer as true honeysuckles (genus Lonicera) belong to the family Caprifoliaceae. Anisacanthus species are sometimes cultivated for use in xeriscaping.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in hot, sunny conditions, reflecting its arid native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, preferring dry periods between waterings. Fertilization should be light and infrequent, as it is adapted to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Its native soils are often lean; a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring, but established plants often thrive without much additional feeding.
