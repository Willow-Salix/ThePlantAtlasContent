## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (southern California, Arizona, Nevada) and northwestern Mexico (Baja California, Sonora) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland (Sonoran Desert) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for optimal growth and flowering, mirroring its native desert exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Highly drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Established plants require minimal supplemental water, primarily during extended dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Justicia californica is a deciduous species of flowering shrub native to the deserts of southern California, southern Arizona, and northern Mexico. Its common names include beloperone, chuparosa (from the Spanish: chuparrosa for hummingbird) and hummingbird bush.
It can grow to 1.5 metres (5 feet) in height and almost as wide. For a short time it bears succulent leaves about 1.5 centimetres (5⁄8 inch) in width. It loses its leaves and then produces plentiful tubular flowers about 2.5–4 cm (1–1+5⁄8 in) long between February and June. These are usually in shades of bright to deep red, or sometimes yellow, with a two-lobed upper lip and a wide three-lobed lower lip that falls open to reveal the inside of the blossom.
It is one of the northernmost distributed species of the mostly tropical genus Justicia. This is a low bush which grows in watered areas of dry, hot sandy regions or rocky terrain of the desert floor, usually below 750 m (2,460 ft) above sea level.
Hummingbirds visit the bush to feed on the nectar. Other birds eat the sugar-rich flower centers. This plant is sometimes cultivated as a landscape ornamental in desert regions for its bright flowers and to attract birds.
The plant is thought to have been eaten by Native Americans of the Southwest.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Chuparosa is a desert-adapted plant thriving in full sun and requiring very little water once established, reflecting its arid native climate. It prefers lean soils and needs minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for hot, dry environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in early spring is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich soil.
