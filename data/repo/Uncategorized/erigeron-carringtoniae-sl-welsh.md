| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (specifically Nevada, Utah, and Arizona) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Montane / Subalpine (often rocky slopes and pinyon-juniper woodlands) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in high light exposure typical of mountain slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low; drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking dry mountain conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This high-desert native requires abundant sunlight and very little water, thriving in conditions that mimic its arid montane home. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid over-fertilizing to maintain its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Native to nutrient-poor, rocky, often limestone soils, so rich fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
