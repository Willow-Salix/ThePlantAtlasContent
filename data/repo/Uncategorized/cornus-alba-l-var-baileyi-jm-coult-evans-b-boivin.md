| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (riparian zones, moist woodlands, forest edges) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, favoring locations with morning sun and some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture; prefers moist to wet soils, mimicking its native habitat along stream banks and in boggy areas. Requires frequent watering, especially during dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cornus is a genus of about 30–60 species of woody plants in the family Cornaceae, commonly known as dogwoods or cornels, which can generally be distinguished by their blossoms, berries, and distinctive bark. Most are deciduous trees or shrubs, but a few species are nearly herbaceous perennial subshrubs, and some species are evergreen. Several species have small heads of inconspicuous flowers surrounded by an involucre of large, typically white petal-like bracts, while others have more open clusters of petal-bearing flowers. The various species of dogwood are native throughout much of temperate and boreal Eurasia and North America, with China, Japan, and the southeastern United States being particularly rich in native species. The genus is also known from South America with members such as Cornus peruviana. 
Species include the common dogwood Cornus sanguinea of Eurasia, the widely cultivated flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) of eastern North America, the Pacific dogwood Cornus nuttallii of western North America, the Kousa dogwood Cornus kousa of eastern Asia, and two low-growing boreal species, the Canadian and Eurasian dwarf cornels (or bunchberries), Cornus canadensis and Cornus suecica respectively.
Depending on botanical interpretation, the dogwoods are variously divided into one to nine genera or subgenera; a broadly inclusive genus Cornus is accepted here.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This dogwood thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native riparian environments. Provide ample water, especially during dry spells, and an annual dose of balanced fertilizer to support its vigorous growth and vibrant stem color.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertility; benefits from an annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, especially in nutrient-poor soils.
