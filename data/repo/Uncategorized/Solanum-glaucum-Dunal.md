## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Temperate Grasslands and Savannas |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it naturally occurs in open fields and disturbed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering, allowing the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. It tolerates some drought but prefers consistent moisture, reflecting its presence near watercourses in its native range. |

## 🌱 Overview
Solanum is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants, which include three food crops of high economic importance: the potato, the tomato and the eggplant (aubergine, brinjal). It is the largest genus in the nightshade family Solanaceae, comprising around 1,500 species. It also contains the so-called horse nettles (unrelated to the genus of true nettles, Urtica), as well as numerous plants cultivated for their ornamental flowers and fruit.
Solanum species show a wide range of growth habits, such as annuals and perennials, vines, subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees. Many formerly independent genera like Lycopersicon (the tomatoes) and Cyphomandra are now included in Solanum as subgenera or sections. Thus, the genus today contains roughly 1,500–2,000 species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This robust plant thrives in full sun, reminiscent of its native open habitats, and requires regular watering with good drainage. It will benefit from moderate fertilization during its active growth period to support healthy development. Mimicking its subtropical to temperate origins, it is quite adaptable.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilizer needs. Feed with a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
