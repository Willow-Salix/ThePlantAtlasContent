## 🧤 Care Instructions
Knotted Rush thrives in consistently wet to saturated soil with full sun to partial shade, mimicking its natural wetland habitat. It requires minimal fertilization, preferring conditions found in ponds, bogs, or very moist garden areas. Ensure continuous moisture for successful growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release aquatic fertilizer can be used sparingly during the growing season if growth is poor.
