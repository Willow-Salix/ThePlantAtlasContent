## 🧤 Care Instructions
American Dittany is a resilient perennial best suited for full sun to partial shade, thriving in well-drained soil. It's notably drought-tolerant once established, requiring average watering but tolerating dry spells. Fertilization needs are minimal, aligning with its natural growth in lean woodland and prairie soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. It naturally grows in lean to average soils, so excessive fertilization is not required and can be detrimental. A light application of compost can suffice if soil nutrients are poor.
