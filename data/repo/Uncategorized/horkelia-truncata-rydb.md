## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ramona Horkelia thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native Southern California chaparral habitat. It requires moderate water during cooler, growing seasons, becoming drought-tolerant in dry summers, and generally does not need significant fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. These plants are adapted to leaner soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental. If growth is poor, a very light, balanced application in early spring may be considered.
