## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, nutrient-poor soil, typical of its Mediterranean fynbos origin. It requires moderate watering during its active growth but is highly drought-tolerant and needs minimal water during hot, dry summers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer sparingly, especially during the growing season. Prefers poor, well-drained soils.
