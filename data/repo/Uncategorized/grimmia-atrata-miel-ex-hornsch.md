## 🧤 Care Instructions
Grimmia Dry Rock Moss thrives in cool, high-altitude conditions with bright, indirect light and consistent moisture, mimicking its native alpine environment. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging, and avoid heavy fertilization as it prefers nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Mosses are not heavy feeders, and alpine environments are typically nutrient-poor. High fertilizer concentrations can be detrimental.
