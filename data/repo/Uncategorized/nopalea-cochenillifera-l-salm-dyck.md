## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mexico and Central America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-arid Tropical and Subtropical Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive and prevent etiolation. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in cooler months, to mimic arid rainfall patterns and prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Opuntia, commonly called the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family Cactaceae, many known for their flavorful fruit and showy flowers. Cacti are native to the Americas, and are well adapted to arid climates; however, they are still vulnerable to alterations in precipitation and temperature driven by climate change. The plant has been introduced to Australia, southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.
Prickly pear alone is also used to refer to the fruit, but may also be used for the plant itself; in addition, other names given to the plant and its specific parts include tuna (fruit), sabra, sabbar, nopal (pads, plural nopales, from the Nahuatl word nōpalli), nostle (fruit) from the Nahuatl word nōchtli, and paddle cactus. The genus is named for the Ancient Greek city of Opus. The fruit and leaves are edible. The most common culinary species is the "Barbary fig" (Opuntia ficus-indica).
In places where they have been introduced outside their native range, some species in the genus Opuntia behave as aggressive invasive species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cactus thrives in conditions mirroring its native semi-arid scrubland, requiring abundant direct sunlight and very infrequent watering. Ensure well-draining soil and protect from excessive moisture to maintain its health. Minimal fertilization is needed, primarily during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; feed sparingly with a diluted cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer) as it's adapted to nutrient-poor soils.
