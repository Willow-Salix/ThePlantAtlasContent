## 🧤 Care Instructions
Creamflower Rockcress is a resilient North American native that thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and is notably drought-tolerant once established. Keep fertilization low to moderate to mimic its natural habitat in rocky, less fertile areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. This plant is not a heavy feeder and can thrive in poor, rocky soils; over-fertilization can be detrimental.
