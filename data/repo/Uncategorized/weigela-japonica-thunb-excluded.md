## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Japanese Weigela flourishes in conditions similar to its native temperate woodlands, favoring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Ensure regular watering during dry periods and apply a light spring fertilization to promote robust growth and plentiful blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, particularly if the soil is poor. Native temperate woodland soils are often moderately fertile, enriched by decaying organic matter.
