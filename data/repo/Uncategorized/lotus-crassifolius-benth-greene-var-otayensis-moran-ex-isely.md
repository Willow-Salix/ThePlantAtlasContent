## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean scrubland. Water sparingly, primarily during cooler months, and avoid heavy fertilization due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Fertilization is generally not required; if growth is poor, apply a very light, balanced fertilizer once in early spring.
