| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth. |

## 🌱 Overview
Astragalus is a large genus of over 3,000 species of herbs and small shrubs, belonging to the legume family Fabaceae and the subfamily Faboideae. It is the largest genus of plants in terms of described species. The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Common names include milkvetch (most species), locoweed (in North America, some species) and goat's-thorn (A. gummifer, A. tragacantha). Some pale-flowered vetches (Vicia spp.) are similar in appearance, but they are more vine-like than Astragalus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, dry soils, reflecting its native grassland and scrubland habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization to mimic its natural, less nutrient-rich environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. It thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all, is generally sufficient.
