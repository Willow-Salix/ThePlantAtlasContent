## 🌱 Overview
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, reflecting its arid and semi-arid native environment. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid overwatering, as it is highly susceptible to root rot in consistently moist conditions. No significant fertilization is typically required, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. This plant thrives in poor, sandy, or gravelly soils with minimal nutrient content.
