## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Inner North Coast Ranges of California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Chaparral/Temperate Grassland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun is ideal, as it grows in open grasslands and edges of woodlands. Can tolerate light partial shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate water during its active growing season in spring, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, especially during its dry summer dormancy period. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stanford Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. Water moderately during spring growth, allowing it to dry out between waterings, and reduce watering significantly during summer dormancy. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires minimal to no fertilizer, preferring poorer soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it prefers poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils and does not require additional nitrogen. Excessive fertilizer can inhibit flowering.
