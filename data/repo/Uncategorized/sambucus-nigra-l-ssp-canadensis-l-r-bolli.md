## 🧤 Care Instructions
The American Black Elderberry thrives in full sun to partial shade within temperate climates, requiring consistently moist, well-drained soil to mimic its native habitat. It benefits from average to rich soil fertility, making it a relatively easy-care plant when provided with adequate moisture and light.
