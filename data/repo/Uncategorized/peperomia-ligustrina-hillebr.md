# Waihee Valley Peperomia
### *Peperomia ligustrina Hillebr.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (endemic to Maui, Oahu, and Molokai) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers bright indirect light to partial shade; direct sun exposure, especially harsh afternoon sun, should be avoided to prevent leaf scorch as it grows in the understory. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Its native high rainfall and humidity suggest a need for regular moisture and high ambient humidity. |

## 🌱 Overview
Peperomia is one of the two large genera of the family Piperaceae. It is estimated that there are over 1,000 species, occurring in all tropical and subtropical regions of the world. They are concentrated in South and Central America, but may also be found in southern North America, the Caribbean islands, Africa, Oceania, and southern and eastern parts of Asia. The exact number of species is difficult to determine, as some plants have been recorded several times with different names, and new species continue to be discovered. Peperomias have adapted to many different environments and their appearances vary greatly. Some are epiphytes (growing on other plants) or lithophytes (growing on rock or in rock crevices), and many are xerophytes (drought-tolerant, with thick succulent structures to save water) or possess underground tubers (geophytes). Most species are compact perennial shrubs or vines.
Some Peperomias have thick, waxy, succulent leaves and stems; still, others are rather delicate, with paper-thin leaves. Many species will easily sunburn, preferring filtered or indirect, bright sunlight. Most of the Peperomias have minimal to virtually non-existent root systems (species-depending), with the entire mass often being nothing more than a collection of tiny, hair-like appendages used to anchor the plant. These roots, while delicate, also enable the plants to survive in less-than-ideal conditions; however, their fragility also places them at a greater risk for root rot if water does not drain sufficiently quickly.
The genus name Peperomia was coined by Spanish botanists Ruiz López and Pavón Jiménez in 1794 after their travels in Peru and Chile. Peperomia plants do not have a widely- accepted common name, and some argue that it is better to use the genus name, as is the case with genera such as Petunia and Begonia. They are sometimes called radiator plants, a name possibly coined by L.H. Bailey because many of them enjoy bright and dry environments similar to a windowsill above a radiator. Furthermore, many individuals simply refer to the many Peperomias by their individual nicknames, such as Peperomia polybotrya being called the “Raindrop Peperomia” (due to its large, drop-shaped leaves), or P. argyreia being the “Watermelon Peperomia”, due to its leaf veining and shape resembling the look of a watermelon.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Waihee Valley Peperomia, replicate its tropical moist forest habitat by providing bright, indirect light and maintaining consistently moist, well-draining soil. Ensure high humidity and fertilize lightly during warmer months to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed sparingly with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease feeding in fall and winter, as native forest soils are not excessively rich.
