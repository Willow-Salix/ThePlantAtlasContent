## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rose Moss thrives in hot, sunny environments with excellent drainage. It is a drought-tolerant plant that requires minimal watering once established and prefers lean soil conditions. Ensure full sun exposure to promote its characteristic vibrant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; a light application of a balanced granular or liquid fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich soil.
