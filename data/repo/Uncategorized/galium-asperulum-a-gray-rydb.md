| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate North America (Canada, northern and western USA), Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest Understory / Boreal Forest Understory |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade; it thrives in the dappled light of a forest understory and should be protected from direct, intense sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture; requires regularly moist but well-drained soil, mimicking the damp conditions found on a forest floor. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This shade-loving plant thrives in cool, humid environments typical of forest understories, needing protection from direct sun. Maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil and ensure adequate organic matter to support its growth. It is relatively low-maintenance once established in suitable conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization; prefers nutrient-rich soil high in organic matter, typical of decomposing leaf litter in its native habitat. A slow-release organic fertilizer or compost can be beneficial.
