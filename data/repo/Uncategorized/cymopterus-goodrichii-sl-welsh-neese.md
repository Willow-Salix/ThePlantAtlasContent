## 🧤 Care Instructions
Toiyabe Springparsley thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, replicating its native montane environment. Water moderately during its active growing season, ensuring the soil dries completely between sessions, and apply fertilizer very sparingly.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Native to nutrient-poor, rocky mountain soils, it does not require rich fertilization and may be harmed by excessive nutrients.
