## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate and Boreal forests across Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate and Boreal Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires very low, indirect light or deep shade. It thrives in dimly lit forest understories, avoiding direct sunlight which can easily desiccate it. |
| **💧 Water** | Constant high humidity and consistently moist, but not waterlogged, substrate are crucial. Frequent misting or placement in a terrarium is recommended to mimic its damp forest floor habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Buxbaumia (bug moss, bug-on-a-stick, humpbacked elves, or elf-cap moss) is a genus of twelve species of moss (Bryophyta). It was first named in 1742 by Albrecht von Haller and later brought into modern botanical nomenclature in 1801 by Johann Hedwig to commemorate Johann Christian Buxbaum, a German physician and botanist who discovered the moss in 1712 at the mouth of the Volga River.  The moss is microscopic for most of its existence, and plants are noticeable only after they begin to produce their reproductive structures. The asymmetrical spore capsule has a distinctive shape and structure, some features of which appear to be transitional from those in primitive mosses to most modern mosses.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rare moss requires a consistent high-humidity environment with very low, indirect light, ideally on a substrate of decaying wood or humus. Maintain constant moisture without waterlogging and avoid direct sunlight and excessive fertilization for successful cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Mosses obtain sufficient nutrients from their environment, primarily from decaying organic matter and rainwater. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
