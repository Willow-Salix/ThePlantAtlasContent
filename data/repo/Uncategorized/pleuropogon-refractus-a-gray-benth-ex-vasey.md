## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate wetland grass thrives in consistently wet to saturated soil and prefers full to partial sun exposure. Ensure its roots never dry out, replicating its native boggy and riparian environments. Incorporate organic matter into the soil for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from rich organic soil amendments to support lush growth, but typically does not require heavy or frequent fertilization if soil is already fertile.
