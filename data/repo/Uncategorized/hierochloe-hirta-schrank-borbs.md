## 🌱 Overview
Hierochloe is a genus of plants in the grass family known generally as sweetgrass. These are perennial rhizomatous grasses found primarily in temperate and subarctic regions of Eurasia and North America, although some species extend southwards into Australia and Latin America.
These erect green grasses are known for their sweet scent. They bear panicle inflorescences with rounded grass grain fruits.
Some authors advocate merging the two genera Hierochloe and Anthoxanthum, though others disagree.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Northern Sweetgrass thrives in cool to subarctic climates, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist soil. Its care should focus on maintaining adequate hydration, especially during warmer spells, and providing moderate nutrients to support its growth in a damp meadow-like environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertility; a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in spring or a diluted liquid feed during the growing season is generally sufficient. Avoid over-fertilizing.
