## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, favoring locations with full sun to partial shade. Ensure its soil never dries out, replicating its natural preference for wet meadows and streambanks. Moderate fertilization will support its growth in rich, organic soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from nutrient-rich soil, but typically does not require heavy fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season is sufficient.
