## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rare Hawaiian plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native subtropical wet forest habitat, requiring consistent moisture and protection from direct, intense sunlight. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot while maintaining high ambient humidity. Provide light fertilization during periods of active growth.
