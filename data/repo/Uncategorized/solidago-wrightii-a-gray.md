## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wright's Goldenrod thrives in sunny, dry conditions typical of its native southwestern US habitat. It is a highly drought-tolerant plant that requires minimal watering once established, preferring well-drained, lean soils. This adaptable perennial is a low-maintenance choice, needing little to no fertilizer to flourish.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to average, well-drained soils. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth. A light, balanced fertilizer once in spring is sufficient if the soil is exceptionally poor.
