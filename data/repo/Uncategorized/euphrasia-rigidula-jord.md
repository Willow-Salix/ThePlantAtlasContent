| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open meadow habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Euphrasia, or eyebright, is a genus of about 215 species of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae (formerly included in the Scrophulariaceae), with a cosmopolitan distribution. They are hemiparasitic on grasses and other plants. Both the common and generic names refer to the plant's use in a lotion for treating eye infections, with Euphrasia literally meaning 'good-cheer'.
Many species are found in alpine or sub-alpine meadows where snow is common. Flowers usually are borne terminally, are zygomorphic, and have a lower petal shaped like a lip. The most common flower colours are purple, blue-white, and violet. Some species have yellow markings on the lower petal to act as a guide to pollinating insects.
Alternative names, mainly in herbalism, are Augentrostkraut, Euphrasiae herba, Herba Euphrasiae and Herbe d'Euphraise.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in bright, open conditions reminiscent of its native temperate meadows. Provide full sun to partial sun and maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil. It has low to moderate fertilizer needs, reflecting its semi-parasitic nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a semi-parasitic plant, it does not require heavy fertilization, relying on host plants for some nutrients. A light, balanced feed once or twice during the growing season is generally sufficient.
