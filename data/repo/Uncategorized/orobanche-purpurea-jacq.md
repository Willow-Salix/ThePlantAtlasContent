## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Mediterranean |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. As a parasitic plant, its success is tied to its host, which typically thrives in open, sunny locations. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry between waterings, consistent with its host plants' needs in temperate/Mediterranean climates. It relies entirely on its host for water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Orobanche, commonly known as broomrape, is a genus of almost 200 species of small parasitic herbaceous plants, mostly native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere. It is the type genus of the broomrape family Orobanchaceae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Purple Broomrape is an obligate parasitic plant that requires specific host plants (e.g., species of Achillea) to survive. Care involves ensuring the host plant thrives in a full sun, well-drained environment with moderate, seasonal watering, as the broomrape draws all its resources from the host.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; this plant is parasitic and derives all nutrients from its host. Direct fertilization is not effective for the broomrape itself.
