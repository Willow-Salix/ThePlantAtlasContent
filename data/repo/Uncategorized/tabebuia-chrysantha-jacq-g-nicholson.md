## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical America, from Mexico south through Central America to countries like Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest or Seasonal Tropical Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun for optimal growth and prolific flowering, consistent with its role as a canopy tree in open and secondary forest habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers regular watering during its active growing season (wet season), but is highly drought-tolerant once established and thrives with reduced water during its dry season, which triggers its characteristic bloom. |

## 🌱 Overview
Tabebuia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. Tabebuia consists almost entirely of trees, but a few are often large shrubs. A few species produce timber, but the genus is mostly known for those that are cultivated as flowering trees.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Roble Amarillo thrives in full sun exposure, reflecting its native open canopy environment. Provide consistent watering during its growing season, but ensure well-draining soil and allow for a drier period to encourage its spectacular bloom. A moderate, balanced fertilizer can support its growth, but avoid overfeeding.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied once or twice during the active growing season, especially in nutrient-poor soils, but generally not a heavy feeder.
