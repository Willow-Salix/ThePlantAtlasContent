## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Iberian Peninsula (Spain, Portugal) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland, Grassland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day) to thrive, reflecting its open habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during its active growth period (cooler months); it is drought-tolerant once established and prefers drier conditions in summer, aligning with Mediterranean dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spanish Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean environment. Water moderately during cooler growing seasons, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and reduce watering significantly in summer. Avoid heavy fertilization, especially nitrogen, due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is needed, particularly nitrogen, as it is a legume and can fix its own nitrogen. Well-draining, moderately fertile to poor soils are generally sufficient.
