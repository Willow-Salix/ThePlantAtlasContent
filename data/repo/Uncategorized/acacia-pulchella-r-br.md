## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern Western Australia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Woodland and Heathland (characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers, often found in moist depressions or along watercourses) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it grows in open woodlands, heathlands, and as an understory plant, indicating adaptability to various light levels, though best flowering occurs with good light exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to high. Thrives with consistent moisture during its active growth period (typically cooler months), especially reflecting its native 'winter-wet depressions' habitat. Once established, it can tolerate short dry spells but prefers regular watering, ensuring good drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Acacia, commonly known as wattles or acacias, is a genus of about 1,084 species of shrubs and trees in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the pea family Fabaceae. Initially, it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa, South America, and Australasia, but is now reserved for species mainly from Australia, with others from New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. The genus name is Neo-Latin, borrowed from Koine Greek ἀκακία (akakia), a term used in antiquity to describe a preparation extracted from Vachellia nilotica, the original type species.
Several species of Acacia have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient wattle thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate to high watering, particularly during its active cooler growing season, while ensuring excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Fertilize sparingly with a low-phosphorus native plant formula, if at all, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal. Adapted to low-nutrient soils, like many Australian natives, it is sensitive to high phosphorus levels. If fertilizing, use a low-phosphorus product specifically formulated for native plants.
