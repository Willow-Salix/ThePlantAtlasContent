## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America (specifically the eastern United States, particularly the Appalachian Mountains and surrounding regions) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade. As a forest understory plant, it requires protection from direct, intense sunlight which can scorch its fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture. Mimic the regular rainfall and damp soil conditions of a temperate forest floor; soil should be kept evenly moist but well-drained, especially during drier periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Polystichum is a genus of ferns in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). The genus has about 500 species and has a cosmopolitan distribution. The highest diversity is in eastern Asia, with about 208 species in China alone; the region from Mexico to Brazil has at least 100 additional species; Africa (at least 17 species), North America (at least 18 species), and Europe (at least 5 species) have much lower diversity. Polystichum species are terrestrial or rock-dwelling ferns of warm-temperate and montane-tropical regions (a few species grow in alpine regions). They are often found in disturbed habitats such as road cuts, talus slopes, and stream banks.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Schweinitz's Christmas Fern thrives in partial to full shade, requiring consistently moist but well-drained soil, similar to its native temperate forest floor habitat. Protect it from harsh direct sun and provide moderate organic fertilization for optimal health. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot while maintaining adequate moisture.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from rich, organic soil. Apply a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice a year in spring or early summer, or enrich soil with compost to mimic natural leaf litter decomposition.
