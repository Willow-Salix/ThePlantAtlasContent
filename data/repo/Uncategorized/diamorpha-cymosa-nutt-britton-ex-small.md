## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States, particularly on granite outcrops in states like Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. Requires direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | During its active growing season (fall to spring), provide consistent moisture but ensure rapid drainage, mimicking its ephemeral pool habitat. Allow the shallow substrate to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant during its summer dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sedum smallii, synonym Diamorpha smallii, is a species of plants in the family Crassulaceae. It is known as elf orpine and Small's stonecrop. As Diamorpha smallii it was considered to be the only species in the genus Diamorpha.
Sedum smallii is endemic to the southeastern United States. It becomes active in late fall and winter, blooms in late March, then dies. It has red succulent leaves that act to reflect light and hold water. It is found primarily on solution pools, shallow basins on rocky outcrops that contain seasonal pools. The plant is mainly found in Georgia, though populations have also been noted in Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. It is listed as an endangered species by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Elf Orpine is a unique annual succulent adapted to the harsh, nutrient-poor conditions of southeastern US granite outcrops. It requires full sun and excellent drainage. Water consistently during its active fall-to-spring growth, allowing the substrate to dry between waterings, and keep dry during its summer dormancy. Fertilization is rarely needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low to no fertilizer. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils typical of its native granite outcrop habitat.
