## 🧤 Care Instructions
Smooth-leaf Panicgrass is a warm-season grass best suited for full to partial sun conditions. It thrives with moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and has low fertilizer needs, reflecting its adaptation to natural, less enriched soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; native to often sandy or less fertile soils, this grass does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced granular fertilizer can be applied once in spring if growth seems stagnant.
