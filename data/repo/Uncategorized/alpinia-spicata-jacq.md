## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Spiked Ginger Lily thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical rainforest origin, requiring bright indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. High humidity and warm temperatures are crucial for its growth, along with regular feeding during the active growing season to encourage lush foliage and vibrant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Apply a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
