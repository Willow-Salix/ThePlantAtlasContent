## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (specifically Utah and Arizona, including the Canyonlands region) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun; requires direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day, typical of open desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to very low; highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering is detrimental. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dalea  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as prairie clover or indigo bush. Its name honors English apothecary Samuel Dale (1659–1739). They are native to the Western hemisphere, where they are distributed from Canada to Argentina. Nearly half of the known species are endemic to Mexico. Two species of Dalea (Dalea ornata and Dalea searlsiae) have been considered for rangeland restoration.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun and requires very little water, adapting to drought conditions common in its arid habitat. Overwatering is a common cause of failure, so allow the soil to dry thoroughly between rare, deep waterings. Fertilization is generally not needed due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and adaptation to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. As a legume (Fabaceae), it fixes nitrogen, and its native soils are typically lean. Heavy fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
