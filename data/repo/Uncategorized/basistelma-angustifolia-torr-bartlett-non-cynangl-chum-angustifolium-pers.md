### *Basistelma angustifolia (Torr.) Bartlett, non CynanG.L. Chum angustifolium Pers.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Texas, USA (Rio Grande Plain, Trans-Pecos) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its native arid and semi-arid Texas habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. Fertilization needs are minimal, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly, perhaps once a year in spring with a balanced, diluted fertilizer, or not at all if planted in native soil.
