## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | High-altitude mountains of the Great Basin region in the Western United States (e.g., Nevada, Utah, eastern California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine/Subalpine, characterized by cold winters, short growing seasons, high winds, intense solar radiation, and often dry, rocky, well-drained soils. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), as it natively grows in exposed, high-altitude environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, deep watering. This plant is highly drought-tolerant once established due to its native dry, rocky habitat. Soil must be allowed to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. Excellent drainage is paramount. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pinus longaeva (commonly referred to as the Great Basin bristlecone pine, intermountain bristlecone pine, or western bristlecone pine) is a long-living species of bristlecone pine tree found in the higher mountains of California, Nevada, and Utah. In 1987, the bristlecone pine was designated one of Nevada's state trees.
Methuselah is a Great Basin bristlecone pine that is 4,857 years old and has been credited as the oldest known living non-clonal organism on Earth.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Great Basin Bristlecone Pine thrives in conditions mimicking its native harsh, high-altitude environment, demanding full sun and extremely well-drained, lean soil. Once established, it requires minimal watering, being highly drought-tolerant, and should never be over-fertilized. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid excessive moisture to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. If absolutely necessary, a very light, slow-release, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in early spring, but generally not recommended.
