## 🌱 Overview
Hybrid tea is an informal horticultural classification for a group of garden roses. The first hybrid tea roses were created in France in the mid-1800s, by cross-breeding the large, floriferous hybrid perpetuals with the tall, elegant tea roses. The hybrid tea is the oldest class of modern garden roses. Hybrid teas exhibit traits midway between their parents, being hardier than the often delicate tea roses, and with a better ability for repeat-flowering than the more robust hybrid perpetuals.
Hybrid tea flowers are well-formed with large, high-centred buds, supported by long, straight and upright stems. Each flower can grow to 8–12.5 cm wide. Hybrid teas are the largest and most popular group of rose, due to their elegant form and large variety of colours. Their flowers are usually borne singly at the end of long stems which also makes them very popular as cut flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid rose is adapted to temperate wetland conditions, requiring consistently moist to wet soil and preferring full sun to partial shade. Ensure high humidity and regular watering, avoiding any dry periods. Moderate fertilization during the growing season will support its vigorous growth and flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high; benefits from regular feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season, especially if soil is not naturally rich in organic matter.
