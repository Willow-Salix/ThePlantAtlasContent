## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native arid and semi-arid regions. Provide moderate water during its spring growth cycle, then ensure it remains dry during its summer dormancy to prevent bulb rot. Minimal fertilization is necessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; if desired, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once during spring growth.
