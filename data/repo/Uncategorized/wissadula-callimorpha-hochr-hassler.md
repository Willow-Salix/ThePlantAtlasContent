## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant prefers bright light conditions, mirroring its native habitat in open, disturbed subtropical regions. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and benefits from occasional feeding during its main growing season.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer can be applied monthly or bi-monthly during the active growing season. Plants in pioneer or disturbed areas often tolerate average to somewhat poor soils, so heavy fertilization is not necessary.
