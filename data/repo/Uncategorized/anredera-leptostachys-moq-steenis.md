| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical South America (e.g., Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial shade; in its native habitat, it thrives climbing towards light along forest edges or disturbed areas. |

## 🌱 Overview
Anredera is a genus of plants native to Latin America, the West Indies, Texas, and Florida. Some are naturalized in other regions (notably Mediterranean region and on various oceanic islands). Most of them evergreen vines of dry scrubland and thickets. Members of the genus are commonly known as Madeira vines. At least one species, A. cordifolia, bears edible roots or tubers and leaves similar to those of Basella alba. The same species has become an invasive plant in many tropical and subtropical regions outside its natural range.
