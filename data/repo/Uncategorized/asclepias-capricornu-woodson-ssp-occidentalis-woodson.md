## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central United States (Great Plains, including states like Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Nebraska) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Semi-arid Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open prairies and grasslands with no canopy cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to periods of low rainfall in its native range. |

## 🌱 Overview
Asclepias is a genus of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants known as milkweeds, named for their latex, a milky substance containing cardiac glycosides termed cardenolides, exuded where cells are damaged. Most species are toxic to humans and many other species, primarily due to the presence of cardenolides. However, as with many such plants, some species feed upon milkweed leaves or the nectar from their flowers. A noteworthy feeder on milkweeds is the monarch butterfly, which uses and requires certain milkweeds as host plants for its larvae.
The Asclepias genus contains over 200 species distributed broadly across Africa, North America, and South America. It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This milkweed thrives in sunny, open environments characteristic of the Great Plains and semi-arid steppes. It prefers well-draining soil and is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal supplemental water. Fertilization is generally not essential unless the soil is exceptionally nutrient-poor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Native prairie soils can be rich, but these plants are not heavy feeders. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient only if soil is poor.
