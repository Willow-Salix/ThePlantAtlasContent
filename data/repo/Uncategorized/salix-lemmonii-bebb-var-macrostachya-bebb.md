## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lemmon's Willow thrives in consistently wet to moist soil conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native riparian environments. Abundant water is crucial for its health, and it benefits from moderate soil fertility. Ensure steady moisture, especially during dry periods, to replicate its natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from moderately rich soil. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can support vigorous growth if soil nutrients are naturally low.
