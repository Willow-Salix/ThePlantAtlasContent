| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Shade (at least 6 hours of direct sun per day for best flowering) |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during establishment. Once mature, it is remarkably drought-tolerant, reflecting its sandy, riparian origins. |

## 🌱 Overview
Baptisia (wild indigo, false indigo) is a genus in the legume family, Fabaceae. They are flowering herbaceous perennial plants with pea-like flowers, followed by pods, which are sometimes inflated. They are native to woodland and grassland in eastern and southern North America. The species most commonly found in cultivation is B. australis.
Baptisia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the jaguar flower moth, Schinia jaguarina.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Baptisia thrives in full sun to partial shade within a humid subtropical climate. It requires well-drained, sandy soil, preferring consistent moisture during its initial growth phase but becoming very drought-tolerant once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it generally needs minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Apply a light, balanced fertilizer in spring only if soil is exceptionally poor.
