## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western Canada and Northwestern United States (e.g., British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Freshwater Aquatic (shallow lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams) |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to full sun, typical of shallow aquatic environments |
| **💧 Water** | Must be consistently submerged in water or grown in perpetually saturated soil; it is an obligate aquatic plant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of lycopod. It is the only living genus in the family Isoetaceae and order Isoetales. As of 2016, there were about 200 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution mostly in aquatic habitats but with the individual species often scarce to rare. Species virtually identical to modern quillworts have existed since the Jurassic epoch, though the timing of the origin of modern Isoetes is subject to considerable uncertainty.
The name of the genus may also be spelled Isoëtes. The diaeresis (two dots over the e) indicates that the o and the e are to be pronounced in two distinct syllables. Including this in print is optional; either spelling (Isoetes or Isoëtes) is correct.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This aquatic plant thrives when consistently submerged in water or grown in perpetually saturated, acidic soil, mimicking its temperate pond or stream habitat. It prefers bright indirect to full sun and requires very minimal additional fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; prefers nutrient-poor, acidic substrates and does not tolerate high levels of fertilization.
