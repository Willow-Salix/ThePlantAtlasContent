## 🌱 Overview
Rapeseed (Brassica napus subsp. napus), also known as rape and oilseed rape and canola, is a bright-yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae (mustard or cabbage family), cultivated mainly for its oil-rich seed, which naturally contains appreciable amounts of mildly toxic erucic acid. The term "canola" denotes a group of rapeseed cultivars that were bred to have very low levels of erucic acid and which are especially prized for use as human and animal food. Rapeseed is the third-largest source of vegetable oil and the second-largest source of protein meal in the world.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Oilseed Rape thrives in full sun and requires consistent moisture, especially during key growth stages. It is a heavy feeder, necessitating rich, well-fertilized soil to support its vigorous growth and oil-rich seed production.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
High nutrient requirements, especially for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, to support vigorous growth and high oil yield. Benefits from fertile soil or regular fertilization.
