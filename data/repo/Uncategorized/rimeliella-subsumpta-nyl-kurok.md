## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in high humidity and indirect light, replicating its native humid subtropical to tropical forest environment. It requires no soil or traditional fertilizer, obtaining all necessary moisture and nutrients from the air.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization is needed. Lichens derive nutrients from airborne particles and rainfall, not soil. Chemical fertilizers can be detrimental.
