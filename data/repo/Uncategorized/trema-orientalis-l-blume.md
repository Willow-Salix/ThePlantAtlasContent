## 🧤 Care Instructions
Oriental Trema is a robust, fast-growing plant from tropical and subtropical climates that thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growth periods. Its adaptability makes it relatively low-maintenance once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to low fertilizer needs. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer can be applied every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer) to support its fast growth, but avoid over-fertilization.
