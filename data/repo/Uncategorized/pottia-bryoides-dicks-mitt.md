## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pottia moss thrives in temperate conditions with full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining substrate. It requires very little to no fertilization, preferring nutrient-poor environments typical of its native disturbed ground and rock habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low. Fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful. It thrives in nutrient-poor substrates characteristic of its native habitats.
