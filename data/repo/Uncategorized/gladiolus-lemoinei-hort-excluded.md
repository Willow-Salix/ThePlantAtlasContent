## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern and Eastern Africa (parents originating from South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Zimbabwe) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Grasslands and Savannas (characterized by warm, wet summers and dry, cooler winters) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade (requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal flowering) |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent and regular watering is essential during the active growing season (spring through summer), keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Reduce significantly or cease watering during the winter dormancy period. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gladiolus (from Latin, the diminutive of gladius, a sword) is a genus of perennial cormous flowering plants in the iris family (Iridaceae).

It is sometimes called the 'sword lily', but is usually called by its generic name (plural gladioli).
The genus occurs in Asia, Mediterranean Europe, South Africa, and tropical Africa. The center of diversity is in the Cape Floristic Region. The genera Acidanthera, Anomalesia, Homoglossum, and Oenostachys, formerly considered distinct, are now included in Gladiolus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gladiolus Lemoinei thrives in full sun with consistent moisture during its summer growth, mimicking its subtropical grassland origins. Ensure well-drained soil and regular fertilization from spring through summer to support its prolific blooms, followed by a dry dormancy in winter to prevent rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to rich soil fertility. Fertilize every 2-4 weeks with a balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., 5-10-5 or similar) during the active growing season, from sprout emergence through flowering.
