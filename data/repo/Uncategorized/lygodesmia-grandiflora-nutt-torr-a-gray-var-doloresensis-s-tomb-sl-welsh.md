## 🌱 Overview
Lygodesmia, called skeletonplant, is a genus of North American flowering plants in the tribe Cichorieae within the family Asteraceae.
The name derives from the Greek lygos, a pliant twig, and desme, a bundle, because of the fascicled twiggy or rush-like stems of the plants.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Dolores River Skeletonplant requires full sun and infrequent watering, thriving in conditions that mimic its native arid scrubland environment. Ensure excellent drainage and provide minimal fertilizer, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and drought.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy or shaly soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very diluted desert plant formula during the active growing season.
