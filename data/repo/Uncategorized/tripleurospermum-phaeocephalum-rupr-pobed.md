## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant flourishes in full sun conditions, typical of its native Central Asian steppes. It is adapted to moderate to low water availability, tolerating periods of dryness between waterings, and requires minimal fertilization. Provide well-draining soil to mimic its natural environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native soils are often lean to moderately fertile, so heavy fertilization is unnecessary. A light, balanced feed in spring may suffice.
