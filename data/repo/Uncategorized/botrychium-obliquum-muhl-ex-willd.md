## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and central North America, including eastern Canada and the eastern United States (from New England south to Florida, west to Missouri and Texas). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest and Woodland Edges |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to partial sun. Prefers dappled light or morning sun with afternoon shade, especially in warmer climates to prevent leaf scorch. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is preferred, but it tolerates periods of drier soil (mesic conditions). Water regularly when the top inch of soil feels dry, ensuring good drainage to prevent root rot, and reduce frequency in cooler months. |

## 🌱 Overview
Botrychium is a genus of ferns, seedless vascular plants in the family Ophioglossaceae. Botrychium species are known as moonworts. They are small, with fleshy roots, and reproduce by spores shed into the air. One part of the leaf, the trophophore, is sterile and fernlike; the other, the sporophore, is fertile and carries the clusters of sporangia or spore cases.  Some species only occasionally emerge above ground and gain most of their nourishment from an association with mycorrhizal fungi.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Oblique Grapefern, provide partial shade to partial sun, mimicking its native woodland edge habitat. Maintain consistent soil moisture, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings, and ensure well-draining, organically rich soil. A light feeding once in spring will support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization in spring with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer is sufficient. It thrives in moderately rich, organic soil typical of woodland floors, so over-fertilization should be avoided.
