## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical / Warm Temperate Wetlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial sun to bright indirect light is ideal. It can tolerate some morning direct sun but should be protected from intense midday or afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking its native habitat near water bodies and in wet sandy areas. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hedyotis (starviolet) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. Many species of this genus such as Hedyotis biflora, H. corymbosa and H. diffusa are well known medicinal plants. Hedyotis is native to tropical and subtropical Asia and to islands of the northwest Pacific. It comprises about 115 species. The type species for the genus is Hedyotis fruticosa.
Hedyotis was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in Species Plantarum. This generic name is derived from two Greek words, hedys, "sweet", and otos, "ear", in reference to the sweet-scented, ear-shaped leaves of some species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in consistently moist, well-drained soil under partial sun or bright indirect light, mimicking its native wetland-edge habitats in the Southeastern USA. Provide regular watering to prevent the soil from drying out and fertilize sparingly with a diluted solution during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding is generally sufficient. Use a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer), or incorporate a slow-release granular fertilizer at the start of spring.
