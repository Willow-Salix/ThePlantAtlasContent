## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Mexican Flame Flower thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-draining soil, mimicking its native habitat's distinct wet and dry seasons. Water moderately during its active growth, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and significantly reduce watering during winter dormancy. It benefits from low to moderate fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied once or twice during the active growing season is sufficient. Avoid over-fertilization.
