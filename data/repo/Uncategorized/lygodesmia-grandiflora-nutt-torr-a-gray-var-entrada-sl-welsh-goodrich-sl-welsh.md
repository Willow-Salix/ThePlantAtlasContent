## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, poor soils, mimicking its arid native habitat. Water sparingly, only when the soil is completely dry, as it is highly drought-tolerant and sensitive to overwatering. No significant fertilization is required for healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; it thrives in nutrient-poor, well-draining soils.
