## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hawthorn thrives in full to partial sun, typical of its native open woodlands. It requires regular watering to maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during dry spells in its humid subtropical climate. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced slow-release product in spring to support healthy growth and fruiting.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertility; apply a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring, especially for young or establishing plants, or amend soil with compost.
