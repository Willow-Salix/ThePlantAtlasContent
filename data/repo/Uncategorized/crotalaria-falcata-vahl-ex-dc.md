## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South America (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Grassland/Savanna |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun exposure, mimicking its native open grassland habitats where it receives direct sunlight for most of the day. Can tolerate partial shade but may have reduced vigor. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular watering during its active growing season, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. It is adapted to periods of both ample rain and drought, so it is somewhat tolerant of dry spells once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Crotalaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae (subfamily Faboideae) commonly known as rattlepods. The genus includes over 700 species of herbaceous plants and shrubs. Africa is the continent with the majority of Crotalaria species (approximately 400 species), which are mainly found in damp grassland, especially in floodplains, depressions and along edges of swamps and rivers, but also in deciduous bush land, roadsides and fields. Some species of Crotalaria are grown as ornamentals. The common name rattlepod or rattlebox is derived from the fact that the seeds become loose in the pod as they mature, and rattle when the pod is shaken. The name derives from the Ancient Greek κρόταλον, meaning "castanet", and is the same root as the name for the rattlesnakes (Crotalus).
Crotalaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Endoclita sericeus, Etiella zinckenella and Utetheisa ornatrix. The toxic alkaloids produced by some members of this genus are known to be incorporated by Utetheisia larvae and used to secure their defense from predators.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, Crotalaria falcata needs a location with full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its subtropical grassland origins. Water regularly during its active growth period, letting the soil dry slightly between applications, and provide light fertilization. It's a relatively low-maintenance plant once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen in the soil, so excessive nitrogen fertilization is generally not necessary.
