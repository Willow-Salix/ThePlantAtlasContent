## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (e.g., United States, Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in full sun exposure typical of open grasslands. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Adapted to dry conditions; water sparingly once established, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Squirrel-tail Fescue prefers full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native temperate grassland and arid scrubland origins. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, thriving on infrequent watering. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its adaptation to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Generally does not require significant fertilization, as it is adapted to less fertile soils found in its native habitats.
