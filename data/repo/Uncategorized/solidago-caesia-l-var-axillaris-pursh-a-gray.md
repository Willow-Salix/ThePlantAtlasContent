## 🧤 Care Instructions
Blue-stemmed Goldenrod thrives in the partial to full shade of a temperate deciduous forest, requiring consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimic its native understory environment by providing regular watering and enriching the soil with organic matter rather than heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from rich, organic soil but does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient.
