## 🌱 Overview
Cuscuta (), commonly known as dodder or amarbel, is a genus of over 201 species of yellow, orange, or red (rarely green) parasitic plants. Formerly treated as the only genus in the family Cuscutaceae, it now is accepted as belonging in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae, on the basis of the work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world, with the greatest species diversity in subtropical and tropical regions; the genus becomes rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern Europe.
Folk names include strangle tare, strangleweed, scaldweed, beggarweed, lady's laces, fireweed, wizard's net, devil's guts, devil's hair, devil's ringlet, goldthread, hailweed, hairweed, hellbine, love vine, pull-down, angel hair, and witch's hair.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a parasitic plant native to the chaparral regions of California, Chaparral Dodder thrives by attaching to drought-tolerant host plants in sunny environments. Its care involves providing a suitable host, as it draws all its water and nutrients from the host, negating the need for direct watering or fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No direct fertilization needed; nutrients are obtained from the host plant, adapted to moderately fertile chaparral soils.
