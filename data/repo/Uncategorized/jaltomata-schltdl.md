| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Montane Forests, Cloud Forests, and disturbed areas within these biomes. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to bright indirect light, often growing as an understory plant or at forest edges. Avoid intense, direct afternoon sun. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To mimic its native montane forest environment, Jaltomata requires consistent moisture, well-drained soil, and bright, indirect light. Moderate fertilization during the growing season will support its health. Ensure protection from harsh direct sun and waterlogging.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
