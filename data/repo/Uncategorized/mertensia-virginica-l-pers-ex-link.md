## 🧤 Care Instructions
Virginia Bluebells are spring ephemerals that flourish in partial to full shade with consistently moist, well-draining, and organically rich soil during their active spring growth. They enter dormancy in summer, at which point watering should be reduced until the following spring.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in rich, organic soil. An annual top-dressing of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is beneficial.
