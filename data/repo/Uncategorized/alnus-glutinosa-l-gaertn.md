## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Most of Europe, southwest Asia, and northern Africa, particularly along rivers, streams, and in wet woodlands. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Riparian Zones and Deciduous Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating various light conditions often found at the edges of water bodies. |
| **💧 Water** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions and tolerates waterlogged environments due to its native habitat along waterways. |

## 🌱 Overview
Alnus glutinosa, the common alder, black alder, European alder, European black alder, or just alder, is a species of tree in the family Betulaceae, native to most of Europe, southwest Asia and northern Africa. It thrives in wet locations where its association with the bacterium Frankia alni enables it to grow in poor quality soils. It is a medium-sized, short-lived tree growing to a height of up to 30 metres (98 feet). It has short-stalked rounded leaves and separate male and female flowers in the form of catkins. The small, rounded fruits are cone-like and the seeds are dispersed by wind and water.
The common alder provides food and shelter for wildlife, with a number of insects, lichens and fungi being completely dependent on the tree. It is a pioneer species, colonising vacant land and forming mixed forests as other trees appear in its wake. Eventually common alder dies out of woodlands because the seedlings need more light than is available on the forest floor. Its more usual habitat is forest edges, swamps and riverside corridors. The timber has been used in underwater foundations and for manufacture of paper and fibreboard, for smoking foods, for joinery, turnery and carving. Products of the tree have been used in ethnobotany, providing folk remedies for various ailments, and research has shown that extracts of the seeds are active against pathogenic bacteria.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The European alder is a robust tree native to temperate European wetlands and riparian zones. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it generally needs little to no supplemental fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, it enriches the soil and generally requires minimal to no supplemental fertilization, especially not nitrogen.
