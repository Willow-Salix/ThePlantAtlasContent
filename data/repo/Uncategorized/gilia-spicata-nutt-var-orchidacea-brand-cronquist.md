## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (specifically eastern Oregon, southern Idaho, northern Nevada, and northwestern Utah) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-arid Shrubland/Grassland (e.g., Sagebrush Steppe, High Desert) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, unshaded desert and steppe environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. This plant is drought-tolerant, adapted to low rainfall patterns with occasional deeper saturation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This variant of Spiked Gilia thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, mirroring its native arid environments. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering only after the soil has thoroughly dried. Minimal fertilization is needed to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Its native soils are often lean and well-drained. A light, balanced fertilizer applied once in spring may be beneficial, but generally, it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions.
