| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically moist, shaded microclimates within deciduous or coniferous forests, often near streams or seeps). |
| **☀️ Light** | Extremely low light to deep shade; mimicking the forest floor, direct sun will scorch and kill the moss. |
| **💧 Water** | Maintain consistently moist substrate; never allow to dry out completely. Requires very high ambient humidity, often achieved with misting or terrarium environments. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in very low light conditions with consistently moist substrate and high humidity, replicating its native shaded, damp forest floor habitat. Avoid direct sunlight and over-fertilization, which can be harmful.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Mosses derive most necessary nutrients from water and ambient air; high nutrient levels can be detrimental.
