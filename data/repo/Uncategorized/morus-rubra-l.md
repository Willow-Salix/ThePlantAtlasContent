## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and central North America, ranging from Ontario and Vermont south to Florida, and west to South Dakota and central Texas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Best fruit production occurs with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight, but it tolerates some afternoon shade, especially in hotter regions. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to high. Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soils, reflecting its native habitat in bottomlands and along streams. Established trees show some drought tolerance but benefit from regular watering during prolonged dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Morus rubra, commonly known as the red mulberry, is a species of mulberry native to eastern and central North America. It is found from Ontario, Minnesota, and Vermont south to southern Florida, and west as far as southeastern South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and central Texas. There have been reports of isolated populations (very likely naturalized) in New Mexico, Idaho, and British Columbia.
Common in the United States, it is listed as an endangered species in Canada, and is susceptible to hybridization with the invasive white mulberry (M. alba), introduced from Asia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Red Mulberry thrives in the conditions of temperate deciduous forests, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is a hardy tree that becomes somewhat drought-tolerant once established and typically requires only minimal fertilization in good soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in naturally rich, organic forest soils. Supplemental fertilization is generally not heavily required, but a balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring for young or underperforming trees.
