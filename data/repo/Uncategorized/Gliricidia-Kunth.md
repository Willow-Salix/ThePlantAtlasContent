## 🧤 Care Instructions
Quickstick thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical dry forest environment, preferring full sun to partial shade and ample light. It requires regular watering during its active growing season but is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing significantly less water during dry periods. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, its fertilizer needs are generally low.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. Occasional balanced fertilizer can support vigorous growth, especially in nutrient-poor soils.
