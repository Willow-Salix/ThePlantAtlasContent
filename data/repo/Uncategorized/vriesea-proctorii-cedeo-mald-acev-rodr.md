## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Puerto Rico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light. Avoid direct harsh sun, especially during midday, as it can scorch leaves. Filtered light under a canopy is ideal. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the central cup (tank) filled with fresh, non-chlorinated water, changing it every few weeks to prevent stagnation. The potting medium (if used) should be kept consistently moist but not waterlogged. High humidity, reflective of its rainforest origin, is crucial and can be maintained with regular misting or a humidity tray. |

## 🌱 Overview
Vriesea is a genus of flowering plants in the botanical family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Tillandsioideae. The genus is named after the Dutch botanist and physician Willem Hendrik de Vriese (1806–1862). Its species are widespread over Mexico, Central America, South America and the West Indies.
The genus includes many "tank bromeliads", which store water in a reservoir (a "tank") formed by their tightly overlapping leaf bases. Containing some of the largest bromeliad species, these tropical plants hold a wide variety of insect fauna. In the wild, some frog species go through their whole life cycle in these bromeliad tanks. This genus is closely related to Guzmania. Both Guzmania and Vriesea have dry capsules that split open to release parachute like seeds similar to dandelions (Taraxacum sp.). Most Vriesea are epiphytes and grow on trees. Their roots function mainly as holdfasts with a more minor role in nutrient uptake. Nutrients are predominantly absorbed from the reservoirs made by the rosette of leaves.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Proctor's Vriesea thrives in conditions mimicking its humid, tropical rainforest home. Provide bright, indirect light, keep its central cup filled with fresh water, and ensure high ambient humidity. Fertilize sparingly with a very dilute solution to support its epiphytic nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires very light feeding, as epiphytes in their natural habitat derive nutrients from decaying organic matter and rain. Use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/8 strength) once every 1-2 months during the growing season, applied to the water in the cup or as a foliar spray.
