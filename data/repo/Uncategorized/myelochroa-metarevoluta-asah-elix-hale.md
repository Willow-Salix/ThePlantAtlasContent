## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | East Asia (e.g., Japan, Korea, China) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Moist Temperate to Subtropical Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect light to partial shade, mimicking light filtered through a forest canopy. Avoid direct, intense sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity is crucial. Regular misting or gentle watering (mimicking rainfall) is needed, allowing for drying periods between wettings to prevent rot. Do not allow to sit in standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Myelochroa is a genus of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. They are commonly known as axil-bristle lichens. It was created in 1987 to contain species formerly placed in genus Parmelina that had a yellow-orange medulla due to the presence of secalonic acids. Characteristics of the genus include tightly attached thalli with narrow lobes, cilia on the axils, and a rhizinate black lower surface. Chemical characteristics are the production of zeorin and related triterpenoids in the medulla. Myelochroa contains about 30 species, most of which grow on bark. The genus has centres of distribution in Asia and North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in humid conditions with indirect light, similar to its native forest habitat. Provide regular misting to maintain high humidity and allow for brief drying cycles. Absolutely no chemical fertilizers should be used, as they can harm the delicate organism.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizers are required or recommended. Lichens absorb nutrients from the air and rain; chemical fertilizers can be detrimental.
