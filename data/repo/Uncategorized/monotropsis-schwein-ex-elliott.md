## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America (southeastern United States and parts of Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Deep shade, thriving under dense forest canopy with minimal direct light. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil, replicating the well-drained but damp conditions of an undisturbed forest floor. |

## 🌱 Overview
Monotropsis is a small genus of just two flowering plants in the family Ericaceae, Monotropsis odorata and Monotropsis reynoldsiae. They are native to the southeastern United States.
Like all members of the subfamily called the monotropes, the species in Monotropsis do not contain chlorophyll. They are myco-heterotrophs, getting its food through parasitism upon fungi rather than photosynthesis. These fungi form a mycorrhiza with nearby tree species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pygmy Pipes is an achlorophyllous mycoheterotrophic plant that cannot be cultivated outside its specific native habitat. It requires the deep shade and consistently moist, undisturbed soil of temperate deciduous forests, along with its specific fungal partners and their host trees, making it impossible to grow conventionally.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed; this plant is mycoheterotrophic and relies entirely on specific fungal associations (mycorrhizal fungi) for all its nutrients, making conventional fertilization useless and potentially harmful.
