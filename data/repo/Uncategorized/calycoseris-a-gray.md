## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah) and Northwestern Mexico (e.g., Baja California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring intense and direct light exposure for most of the day, consistent with open desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. These plants are highly drought-tolerant, adapted to long periods without rain. |

## 🌱 Overview
Calycoseris is a small genus of two species of annual desert wildflowers in the family Asteraceae, native to western North America in the southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico. They are characterized by the tack-shaped gland hairs on their upper stems and bracts, the trait which gives them the common name tackstem. The two species of tackstem are the yellow tackstem, Calycoseris parryi and the white tackstem, Calycoseris wrightii.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tackstem thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its native desert habitat. It requires very infrequent watering, preferring the soil to dry out thoroughly between applications, and has minimal fertilizer needs. Mimicking these harsh, dry, and sunny conditions is key to its successful cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs, as native desert soils are typically poor in organic matter and nutrients. Minimal to no fertilization is generally required.
