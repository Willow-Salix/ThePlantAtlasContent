## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in moist, rich, well-drained soil, mimicking its native temperate woodland habitat. It requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods, and can tolerate both partial shade and full sun, with some afternoon shade being beneficial in hotter regions. Ensure good soil fertility for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in rich, organic soil; an annual application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring can benefit plants in poorer soils.
