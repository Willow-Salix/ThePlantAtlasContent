## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and well-draining, often nutrient-poor soils characteristic of arid regions. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between applications, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Minimal fertilization is needed for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring if growth appears weak.
