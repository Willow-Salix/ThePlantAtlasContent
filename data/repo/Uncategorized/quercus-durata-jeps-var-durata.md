## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (specifically North Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada foothills) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Oak Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open woodlands and chaparral. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during hot, dry summers. Requires more moisture during cooler, wet season equivalent. |

## 🌱 Overview
Quercus durata, commonly known as leather oak, is a species of oak in the white oak group (subgenus Quercus, section Quercus). The common name "leather oak" is derived from the leathery texture on the lop of its leaves.
It is endemic to California, common in the Coast Ranges and the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. It is found nearly exclusively on serpentine soil.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Leather Oak thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean chaparral habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering, especially during summer dormancy. Fertilization is rarely needed for mature plants.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. These plants are adapted to nutrient-poor soils; over-fertilization can be detrimental. If necessary, a light application of a slow-release, balanced fertilizer in late winter/early spring is sufficient for young plants.
