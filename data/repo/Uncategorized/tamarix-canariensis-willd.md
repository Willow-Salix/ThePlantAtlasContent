| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Canary Islands (Spain) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) to thrive and maintain its characteristic growth habit. |
| **💧 Water** | Highly drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Young plants require more consistent moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
The genus Tamarix (tamarisk, salt cedar, taray) is composed of about 50–60 species of flowering plants in the family Tamaricaceae, native to drier areas of Eurasia and Africa. The generic name originated in Latin and may refer to the Tamaris River in Hispania Tarraconensis (Spain).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Canary Island Tamarisk is a resilient plant perfectly suited for arid and semi-arid conditions. Provide it with full sun and well-draining soil, and water sparingly once it's established to mimic its native environment. It is low-maintenance regarding nutrients, requiring minimal to no fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Generally does not require regular fertilization, especially if grown in typical garden soil. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be beneficial in very poor soils, but avoid over-fertilizing.
