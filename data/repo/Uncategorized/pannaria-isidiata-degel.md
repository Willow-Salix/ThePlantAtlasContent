## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in humid warm-temperate to subtropical regions across various continents, including North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, southeastern USA), Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Warm-Temperate to Subtropical Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires deep shade to very low, indirect light. Direct sunlight is detrimental, especially when the lichen is dry. |
| **💧 Water** | Thrives in consistently high humidity with frequent wetting from rainfall or mist. It absorbs moisture directly from the environment and needs to dry slightly between periods of wetness, avoiding prolonged desiccation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pannaria is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Pannariaceae. These lichens form leaf-like, scaly, or crusty patches that typically arrange themselves in loose rosettes on tree bark in humid forests. Most species partner with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, though some contain green algae instead. The genus was established in 1828 and now includes about 80 recognized species found worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen requires a consistently humid environment with deep shade and good air circulation. It thrives on frequent wetting and subsequent gentle drying, absorbing moisture and nutrients directly from the air and precipitation without the need for traditional watering or fertilization. Protection from direct sun and pollutants is crucial for its survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require fertilization. This lichen is sensitive to high nutrient levels and air pollution, deriving all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere and substrate.
