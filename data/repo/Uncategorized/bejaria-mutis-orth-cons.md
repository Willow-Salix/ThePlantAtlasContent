## 🧤 Care Instructions
Flyweed thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical montane cloud forest and páramo environments, requiring consistently moist, acidic, well-drained soil and high humidity. Provide bright, indirect to partial sunlight, and fertilize sparingly with an acidic formulation to encourage healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with an acidic, slow-release or diluted liquid fertilizer, particularly during the growing season. Sensitive to high salt buildup.
