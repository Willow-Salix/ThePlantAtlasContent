## 🧤 Care Instructions
This annual grass, native to the humid subtropical Southeastern U.S., prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist soil. It is relatively undemanding regarding fertilization, thriving with low to moderate nutrient levels during its active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a general-purpose balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season, as it often colonizes disturbed or moderately fertile soils.
