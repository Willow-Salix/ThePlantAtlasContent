## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern California, USA (specifically Shasta County and surrounding areas in the Klamath Mountains and Cascade Range foothills) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (warm, dry summers; mild, wet winters), found in woodland, chaparral, and forest openings at moderate elevations. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; tolerates full sun but may appreciate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water moderately during active growth, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires less water during cooler, dormant periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ageratina, commonly known as snakeroot, is a genus of over 300 species of perennials and rounded shrubs in the family Asteraceae.
These plants grow mainly in the warmer regions of the Americas and West Indies. Over 150 species are native to Mexico. Some flourish in the cooler areas of the eastern United States. Two Mexican species have become a pest in parts of Australia and Taiwan. Ageratina used to belong to the genus Eupatorium, but it has been reclassified.
The genus name Ageratina means "like Ageratum" and consists of Ageratum and -ina, the feminine form of the Latin adjectival suffix -inus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Shasta snakeroot thrives in a Mediterranean-like environment with full sun to partial shade and excellent drainage. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between applications. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, fertilization should be kept to a minimum.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to nutrient-poor soils like serpentine. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, or none if the soil is naturally fertile.
