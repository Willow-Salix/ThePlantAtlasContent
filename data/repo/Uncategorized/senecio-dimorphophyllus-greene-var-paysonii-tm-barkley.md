## 🧤 Care Instructions
Payson's Ragwort thrives in cool, high-altitude conditions with strong sunlight and excellent drainage. Ensure consistent moisture during its brief growing season, while avoiding waterlogging, and provide minimal fertilization to mimic its native alpine environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is typically needed. If growth appears weak, a very diluted, balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer can be applied once early in the growing season to mimic its naturally lean, rocky soils.
