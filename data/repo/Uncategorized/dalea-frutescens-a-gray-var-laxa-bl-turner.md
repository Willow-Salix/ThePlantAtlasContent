## 🌱 Overview
Dalea  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as prairie clover or indigo bush. Its name honors English apothecary Samuel Dale (1659–1739). They are native to the Western hemisphere, where they are distributed from Canada to Argentina.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Black Dalea var. laxa is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub perfectly suited for arid landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, demanding minimal watering once established due to its native desert climate adaptations. Avoid excessive fertilization, as it is naturally adapted to lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of arid regions and generally does not require fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
