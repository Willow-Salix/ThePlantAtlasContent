## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (specifically the Rocky Mountains and Intermountain West, including Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane / Subalpine (open, rocky slopes, meadows, and forest clearings with distinct seasons, cold winters, and moderate, often dry summers) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to light partial shade; thrives in high sun exposure common to its native open habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to low, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings; highly drought-tolerant once established and intolerant of excessive moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Replicate its native montane habitat by providing full sun and exceptionally well-drained, lean soil. Water sparingly once established, ensuring the soil dries completely between waterings, as it is highly intolerant of wet feet.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; prefers lean to average, well-drained soils, as excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
