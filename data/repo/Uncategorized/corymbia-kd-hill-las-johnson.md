## 🌱 Overview
Corymbia, commonly known as bloodwoods, is a genus of about one hundred species of tree that, along with Eucalyptus, Angophora and several smaller groups, are referred to as eucalypts. Until 1990, corymbias were included in the genus Eucalyptus and there is still considerable disagreement among botanists as to whether separating them is valid. As of January 2020, Corymbia is an accepted name at the Australian Plant Census.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Corymbia species thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking their native open woodlands and savannas. They tolerate drought once established, requiring moderate watering with dry periods between sessions. Minimal fertilization with a low-phosphorus product is best.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer specifically formulated for Australian native plants sparingly, if at all.
