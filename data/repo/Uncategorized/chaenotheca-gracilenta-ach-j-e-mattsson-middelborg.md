## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern Hemisphere, widely distributed across temperate and boreal forest regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate and Boreal Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. In its natural habitat, it often grows on well-lit surfaces within the forest, tolerating full sun in cooler, high-latitude areas, but generally prefers dappled or filtered light. |
| **💧 Water** | High ambient humidity is crucial. Lichens absorb moisture from the air and precipitation. Mimic regular rainfall or misting, allowing for periods of drying out slightly between wetting to prevent fungal issues. Avoid prolonged desiccation or waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chaenotheca is a genus of lichenized fungi within the family Coniocybaceae. The sexual reproduction structures are a mass of loose ascospores that are enclosed by a cup shaped exciple sitting on top of a tiny stalk, having the appearance of a dressmaker's pin (called a mazaedium), hence the common name pin lichen. Genus members are also commonly called needle lichens. Photobiont partners for Chaenotheca include members of the algae genera Symbiochloris, Trebouxia, Trentepohlia, and Tritostichococcus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Chaenotheca gracilenta thrives in the stable, moderately humid environments of temperate and boreal forests. Provide bright, indirect to partial sun and ensure consistently high ambient humidity, allowing it to absorb moisture from mist or rain. No fertilization is needed, as it naturally acquires nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens derive necessary nutrients from the air (dust, aerosols) and their substrate (decaying wood, bark). Additional fertilization is not required and can be detrimental.
