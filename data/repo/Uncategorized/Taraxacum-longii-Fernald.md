## 🌱 Overview
Taraxacum () is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, which consists of species commonly known as dandelions. The scientific and hobby study of the genus is known as taraxacology. The genus has a near-cosmopolitan distribution, absent only from tropical and polar areas. Two of the most common species worldwide, T. officinale (the common dandelion) and T. erythrospermum (the red-seeded dandelion), are European species introduced into North America, where they are non-native. Dandelions thrive in temperate regions and can be found in yards, gardens, sides of roads, among crops, and in many other habitats.
Like other members of the family Asteraceae, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is called a floret. In part due to their abundance, along with being a generalist species, dandelions are one of the most vital early spring nectar sources for a wide host of pollinators. Many Taraxacum species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Taraxacum longii Fernald thrives in temperate climates, preferring full to partial sun exposure and moderate watering where the soil can dry slightly between sessions. This resilient plant has low fertilizer needs, adapting well to average or even poor soil conditions, making it relatively low maintenance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; generally not required as it thrives in average to poor soils. May benefit from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer in very poor soils, but typically not necessary.
