## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of North America, Europe, and Asia, particularly in open woodlands, heathlands, and bogs. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Boreal Forest and Heathland |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers moderate to high indirect light or partial sun; tolerates some direct morning sun. Avoid intense, prolonged direct afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent humidity and regular moisture, typically from rainfall or mist. Allow the substrate to dry slightly between watering to prevent rot, but do not allow prolonged desiccation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations.
Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).
Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.
Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dunes, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.
Larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes continuella, feed on Cladonia species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cup lichen thrives in open, airy environments with moderate to high light and consistent humidity. Avoid overwatering and waterlogged conditions, allowing the substrate to dry briefly between moistening. Fertilizers are generally detrimental and should be avoided.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require and can be harmed by traditional fertilizers. Obtains nutrients from air and substrate; provide only trace minerals if necessary, but generally none.
