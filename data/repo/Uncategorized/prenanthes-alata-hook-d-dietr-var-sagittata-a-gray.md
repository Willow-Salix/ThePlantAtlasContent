## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest and Subalpine Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to dappled sun. Can tolerate full sun in very moist, cool climates, but prefers some protection from intense afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil. Requires regular watering to prevent drying out, especially in warmer or drier conditions, mimicking its native habitat along streambanks and wet clearings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Prenanthes is a genus of plant in the family Asteraceae, often referred to as rattlesnake root.
Molecular analysis in 2009 revealed that the genus as traditionally envisioned was polyphyletic, meaning that it is a conglomeration of species not closely related to one another. The genus formerly included species now placed in Aetheorhiza, Askellia, Brickellia, Chondrilla, Crepidiastrum, Crepis, Emilia, Erythroseris, Faberia, Hololeion, Hypochaeris, Ixeris, Lactuca, Lapsanastrum, Launaea, Lygodesmia, Nabalus, Notoseris, Paraprenanthes, Parasenecio, Picrosia, Sonchella, Sonchus, Soroseris, Stephanomeria, Trixis, and Youngia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in cool, moist environments typical of its native temperate forests and subalpine meadows. Provide consistently moist, well-draining soil and partial shade for optimal growth. It generally requires minimal fertilization, benefiting most from organically rich soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from organically rich soil; an annual top-dressing of compost or a light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, as it typically grows in nutrient-cycling forest environments.
