| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers at least 6 hours of direct sun daily to promote abundant flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Water regularly and deeply during the active growing season (spring/summer), allowing the topsoil to dry out between waterings. Reduce watering significantly and allow the plant to go dormant in fall/winter, mimicking its native wet and dry seasons. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide plenty of sunlight, mimicking its open grassland habitat. Water consistently during its growing season, then allow for a dry, dormant period to replicate its native climate cycles. Fertilize sparingly while actively growing to support its moderate nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed lightly with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growth period; no fertilizer during dormancy.
