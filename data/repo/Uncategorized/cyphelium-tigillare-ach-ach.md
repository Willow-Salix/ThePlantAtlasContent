## 🧤 Care Instructions
Soot Lichen thrives in bright indirect to partial sun conditions, replicating its natural habitat on sun-exposed deadwood in temperate and boreal forests. It requires high ambient humidity and occasional misting for moisture absorption, rather than traditional watering. No specific fertilization is needed for its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required, as lichens obtain necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and their substrate.
