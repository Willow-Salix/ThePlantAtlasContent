## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-arid Grassland and Desert Scrub |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun; requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Exposure to intense sun is crucial for health and flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. During active growth (spring/summer), water every 2-4 weeks, reducing significantly to almost none during dormancy (fall/winter). |

## 🌱 Overview
Opuntia, commonly called the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family Cactaceae, many known for their flavorful fruit and showy flowers. Cacti are native to the Americas, and are well adapted to arid climates; however, they are still vulnerable to alterations in precipitation and temperature driven by climate change. The plant has been introduced to Australia, southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.
Prickly pear alone is also used to refer to the fruit, but may also be used for the plant itself; in addition, other names given to the plant and its specific parts include tuna (fruit), sabra, sabbar, nopal (pads, plural nopales, from the Nahuatl word nōpalli), nostle (fruit) from the Nahuatl word nōchtli, and paddle cactus. The genus is named for the Ancient Greek city of Opus. The fruit and leaves are edible. The most common culinary species is the "Barbary fig" (Opuntia ficus-indica).
In places where they have been introduced outside their native range, some species in the genus Opuntia behave as aggressive invasive species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Grassland Pricklypear thrives in conditions mimicking its semi-arid native habitat, requiring abundant full sun and minimal watering to prevent root rot. It prefers well-draining soil and benefits from very light, infrequent fertilization during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; apply a balanced, diluted cactus or succulent fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer). Avoid fertilizing in fall and winter.
