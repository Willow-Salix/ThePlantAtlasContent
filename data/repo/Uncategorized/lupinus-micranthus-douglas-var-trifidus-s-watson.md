## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in full sun and well-draining soil, Small-flowered Lupine requires moderate watering during its active spring growth, tolerating dry conditions once established. Being a nitrogen-fixing legume, it needs little to no supplemental fertilizer, especially nitrogen, to flourish.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, as lupines are legumes that fix nitrogen in the soil. Excess nitrogen can hinder flowering.
