## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mimic its native dry, open, and rocky environment by providing ample light and allowing the substrate to dry out between infrequent waterings. This moss requires minimal nutrients, thriving on neglect rather than rich care, and dislikes prolonged moisture.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required, as mosses have low nutrient demands and are adapted to nutrient-poor environments.
