# Bracted Allocarya
### *Allocarya bracteata Howell*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (primarily California and southwestern Oregon) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Vernal Pool Habitat |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as its native habitat is open and exposed. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely specific. Requires abundant water, often standing water, during its active growth phase (winter/spring). Must experience a prolonged, completely dry period during summer dormancy to mimic its native vernal pool cycle. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant requires a distinct wet-dry cycle, needing saturated soil or standing water during its growth period (winter/spring) and then complete dryness for dormancy in summer. Provide full sun exposure and avoid heavy fertilization, as it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native vernal pool soils are typically low in nutrients, and the plant is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.
