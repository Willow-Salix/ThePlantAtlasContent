## 🌱 Overview
Solanum is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants, which include three food crops of high economic importance: the potato, the tomato and the eggplant (aubergine, brinjal). It is the largest genus in the nightshade family Solanaceae, comprising around 1,500 species. It also contains the so-called horse nettles (unrelated to the genus of true nettles, Urtica), as well as numerous plants cultivated for their ornamental flowers and fruit.
Solanum species show a wide range of growth habits, such as annuals and perennials, vines, subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees. Many formerly independent genera like Lycopersicon (the tomatoes) and Cyphomandra are now included in Solanum as subgenera or sections. Thus, the genus today contains roughly 1,500–2,000 species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This South American native thrives in a humid subtropical environment, preferring full sun to partial shade for optimal flowering. Provide consistent moisture during its growing season, ensuring well-draining soil, and feed regularly with a balanced fertilizer to support its vigorous vining habit.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring through summer) to encourage lush foliage and prolific blooming.
