## 🧤 Care Instructions
This annual plant thrives with full sun exposure and requires abundant water during its winter-spring growing period to emulate its native vernal pool environment. A subsequent dry summer dormancy is crucial. Utilize low to moderate fertilization during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, primarily during the active growth phase. Over-fertilizing can be detrimental.
