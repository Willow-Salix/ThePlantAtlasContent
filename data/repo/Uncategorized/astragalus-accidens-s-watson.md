## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Rogue River Milkvetch thrives in full sun and well-draining, even rocky, soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering, particularly during its summer dormancy. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it needs little to no fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. May benefit from a very light application of a low-phosphorus, low-potassium fertilizer in extremely poor soils, or no fertilizer at all.
