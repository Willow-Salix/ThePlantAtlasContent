## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical coastal plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistent moisture and good drainage, mimicking its native environment. Provide light, balanced fertilizer during active growth and ensure warm temperatures, as it is not tolerant of cold.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization, using a balanced slow-release formula, especially during active growth, as coastal sandy soils are often nutrient-poor.
