## 🌱 Overview
Apocynum, commonly known as dogbane or Indian hemp, is a small genus of the flowering plant family Apocynaceae. Its name comes from Ancient Greek ἀπόκυνον, from ἀπο- apo- "away" and κύων kyōn "dog", referring to dogbane (Cionura erecta), which was used to poison dogs. The genus is native to North America, temperate Asia, and southeastern Europe.
Apocynum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the queen butterfly and the mouse moth.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full to partial sun, mirroring its native open habitats in temperate regions. It requires moderate watering, preferring consistently moist but well-drained soil, though it can withstand periods of drought. Minimal fertilization is generally needed, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typically not a heavy feeder. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly if soil nutrients are poor or growth is lacking.
