## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South America (Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, parts of Brazil) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to low; water deeply when the soil is completely dry, allowing it to dry out significantly between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Achnatherum is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It includes 20 species of needlegrass native to temperate Eurasia and North Africa. Several needlegrass species have been switched between Achnatherum and genus Stipa; taxonomy between the two closely related genera is still uncertain. In 2019 Peterson et al. reorganized the genera in tribe Stipeae based on molecular DNA studies, and placed the species from the Americas into other genera.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pappose Needlegrass thrives in open, sunny locations with well-draining soil, mimicking its native temperate grassland environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs infrequent watering once established, along with very low fertilizer application.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically requires minimal fertilization, perhaps a light, balanced granular application in early spring if soil nutrients are poor.
