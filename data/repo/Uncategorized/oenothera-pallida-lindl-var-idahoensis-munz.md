## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mirroring its arid scrubland origins. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, along with little to no fertilizer. Mimic its dry, sunny, and nutrient-poor natural environment for optimal growth and prolific flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
