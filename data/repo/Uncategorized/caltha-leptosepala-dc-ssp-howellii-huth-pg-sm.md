| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including mountainous regions from Alaska south through the Pacific Northwest to California, and east to the Rocky Mountains. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Wetlands, Wet Meadows, and Riparian Zones. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun in cooler climates or at higher elevations, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in warmer areas. |

## 🌱 Overview
Caltha is a genus of rhizomatous perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae ("buttercup family"), to which ten species have been assigned. They occur in moist environments in temperate and cold regions of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Their leaves are generally heart-shaped or kidney-shaped, or are characteristically diplophyllous (the auricles of the leaf blades form distinctly inflexed appendages). Flowers are star shaped and mostly yellow to white. True petals and nectaries are missing but the five or more sepals are distinctly colored. As usual in the buttercup family there is a circle of stamens around (two to twenty-five) free carpels.
