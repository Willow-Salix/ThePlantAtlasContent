## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native glade and woodland habitats. It requires moderate watering to maintain soil moisture and benefits from light, occasional fertilization rather than heavy feeding for optimal health.

Low to moderate. A light, balanced fertilizer or compost application in spring is generally sufficient. Avoid over-fertilizing.
