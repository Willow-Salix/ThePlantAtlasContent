## 🌱 Overview
Celtis occidentalis, commonly known as the common hackberry, is a large deciduous tree native to North America. It is also known as the nettletree, beaverwood, northern hackberry, and American hackberry. It is a moderately long-lived hardwood, with a light-colored wood that is yellowish gray to light brown with yellow streaks.
The common hackberry is easily distinguished from elms and some other hackberries by its cork-like bark with wart-like protuberances. The leaves are distinctly asymmetrical and coarse-textured.  It produces small fruits that turn orange-red to dark purple in the autumn, often staying on the trees for several months.  The common hackberry is easily confused with the sugarberry (Celtis laevigata); these two are most easily distinguished by their range and habitat. The common hackberry also has wider leaves that are coarser above than the sugarberry.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Common Hackberry is a resilient North American native tree that thrives in full sun and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, becoming quite drought-tolerant once established. It requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for various landscapes. Ensure adequate space for its mature size and root system.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; generally does not require regular fertilization in average to rich soils. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied if soil is poor or growth is stunted.
