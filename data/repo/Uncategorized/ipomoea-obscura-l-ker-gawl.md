## 🌱 Overview
Ipomoea () is the largest genus in the plant family Convolvulaceae, with over 600 species. It is a large and diverse group, with common names including morning glory, water convolvulus or water spinach, sweet potato, bindweed, moonflower, etc. The genus occurs throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and comprises annual and perennial herbaceous plants, lianas, shrubs, and small trees; most of the species are twining climbing plants.
Their most widespread common name is morning glory, but some species in related genera bear that same common name and some Ipomoea species are known by different common names. Those formerly separated in Calonyction (Greek καλός kalós "good" and νύξ, νυκτός núx, nuktós, "night") are called moonflowers. The name Ipomoea is derived from the Ancient Greek ἴψ, meaning 'woodworm', and ὅμοιος (hómoios), meaning "resembling". It refers to their twining habit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable morning-glory thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. Provide light fertilization during its growing period to support its vigorous growth and prolific flowering in well-draining soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced or slightly higher phosphorus fertilizer during the growing season to encourage flowering, as it adapts to average to poor soils
