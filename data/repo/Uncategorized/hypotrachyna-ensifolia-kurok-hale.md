## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in high humidity and bright indirect light, mimicking its native montane rainforest habitat. Ensure consistent moisture through misting or a humid environment, and avoid direct sun. No traditional fertilization is needed, as it absorbs nutrients from the air and water.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Lichens derive nutrients from the air and rainwater, making traditional fertilization unnecessary and potentially harmful.
