## 🧤 Care Instructions
This thistle prefers temperate mountain conditions, requiring ample sunlight and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Ensure good drainage and provide moderate watering, especially during its active growth. An annual application of organic matter or a balanced fertilizer will support its vigor.
