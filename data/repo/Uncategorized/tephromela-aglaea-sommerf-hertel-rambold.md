## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of Europe and North America, including mountainous and coastal areas |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate to Boreal, specifically on exposed siliceous rocks within Montane or Coastal environments |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires high sun exposure and direct light, mimicking its natural habitat on exposed rock faces. |
| **💧 Water** | Needs regular atmospheric moisture from rain, dew, or mist, but tolerates periods of desiccation. Avoid prolonged saturation or standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Tephromela is a genus of lichens in the family Tephromelataceae. There are about 50 species in this widespread genus. The genus was established in 1929 by the French lichenologist Maurice Choisy, who separated these species from the broader genus Lecanora based on their distinctive straight asexual spores and dark violet spore-bearing layers. These rock and bark-dwelling lichens are characterized by their white to pale grey crusty growth and black disc-shaped reproductive structures with purple-tinted interiors.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tephromela aglaea thrives in conditions replicating its exposed, rocky native habitats. Provide ample direct sunlight and ensure consistent atmospheric moisture through misting or high humidity, while allowing for dry periods. This lichen requires no fertilization and prefers nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low; lichens derive nutrients from the air and rain, and do not require traditional fertilization. Fertilizers can be harmful.
