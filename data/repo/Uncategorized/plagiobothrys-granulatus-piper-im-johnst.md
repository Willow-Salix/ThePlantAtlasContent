## 🧤 Care Instructions
This annual plant thrives in full sun and requires abundant water during its active growing season from winter to spring, mimicking its native vernal pool habitat. Allow the soil to dry out completely during summer dormancy. Fertilizer needs are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to less nutrient-rich environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced, diluted fertilizer may be beneficial during peak growth, but often not strictly necessary.
