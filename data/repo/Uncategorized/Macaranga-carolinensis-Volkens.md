## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Micronesia (Caroline Islands, Marshall Islands, Mariana Islands, Palau, Yap) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest / Tropical Island Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial direct sun. As a pioneer species in its native habitat, it thrives in open areas or forest edges receiving ample light. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water frequently, especially during warm periods, ensuring good drainage to mimic its high rainfall environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Macaranga is a large genus of Old World tropical trees of the family Euphorbiaceae and the only genus in the subtribe Macaranginae (tribe Acalypheae). Native to Africa, Australasia, Asia and various islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the genus comprises over 300 different species. It was first described as a genus in 1806, based on specimens collected on the Island of Mauritius. Many species, such as Macaranga gigantea have uncommonly large leaves, and many are peltate.
Macaranga are noted for being pioneer species. Macaranga species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Endoclita malabaricus. Macaranga species often form symbioses with ant (Formicidae) species (particularly Crematogaster ants of the subgenus Decacrema) because they have hollow stems that can serve as nesting space and occasionally provide nectar. The trees benefit because the ants attack herbivorous insects and either drive them away or feed on them.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Caroline Macaranga requires conditions replicating its tropical island origin, including bright indirect to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular fertilization during growth supports its vigorous nature. High humidity is also beneficial for this tropical species.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Its native soils are often rich in organic matter but can experience nutrient leaching from heavy rains.
