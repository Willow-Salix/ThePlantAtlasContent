## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia, Alabama) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Shrubland / Pine Barrens |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun (Full sun exposure for at least 6+ hours daily), reflecting its native open habitat in pine flatwoods and sandhills. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Its adaptation to sandy soils suggests good drainage is crucial, and it can tolerate periods of drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Asimina is a genus of small trees or shrubs described as a genus in 1763. Asimina is the only temperate genus in the tropical and subtropical flowering plant family Annonaceae. Asimina have large, simple leaves and large fruit. It is native to eastern North America and collectively referred to as pawpaw. The genus includes the widespread common pawpaw Asimina triloba, which bears the largest edible fruit indigenous to the United States. Pawpaws are native to 26 states of the U.S. and to Ontario in Canada. The common pawpaw is a patch-forming (clonal) understory tree found in well-drained, deep, fertile bottomland and hilly upland habitat. Pawpaws are in the same plant family (Annonaceae) as the custard apple, cherimoya, sweetsop, soursop, and ylang-ylang;  the genus is the only member of that family not confined to the tropics. Fossils date to the Cretaceous.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lloyd's St. John's Wort thrives in full sun and well-draining sandy soils, typical of its native southeastern US pine barrens. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and requires minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. Overall, it is a relatively low-maintenance plant suited for dry, sunny locations.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, infrequent feeding. Native to often nutrient-poor, sandy soils, it does not require heavy fertilization.
