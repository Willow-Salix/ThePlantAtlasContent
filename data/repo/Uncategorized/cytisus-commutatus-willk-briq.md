## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Iberian Peninsula (Spain, Portugal) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Atlantic Montane Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring full sun for optimal flowering and growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during dry periods, ensuring the soil dries slightly between waterings. Tolerant of some drought once established, but dislikes waterlogged conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cytisus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae, native to open sites (typically scrub and heathland) in Europe, western Asia and North Africa. It belongs to the subfamily Faboideae, and is one of several genera in the tribe Genisteae which are commonly called brooms. They are shrubs producing masses of brightly coloured, pea-like flowers, often highly fragrant. Members of the segregate genera Calicotome, Chamaecytisus, and Lembotropis are sometimes included in Cytisus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Portuguese Broom thrives in full sun to partial shade, mimicking its native open, montane scrubland habitat. It requires regular watering during dry spells, but good drainage is crucial to prevent root rot. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it has low fertilizer needs, thriving in poor to moderately fertile, acidic soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes its own nitrogen; therefore, high-nitrogen fertilizers should be avoided. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is optional on very poor soils.
