## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mojave Spineflower thrives in dry, hot, and sunny conditions, mirroring its native desert environment. Provide full sun and water very sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Fertilization is generally not required for this drought-adapted plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Its native desert soils are typically poor in nutrients, so rich soil or frequent feeding is unnecessary.
