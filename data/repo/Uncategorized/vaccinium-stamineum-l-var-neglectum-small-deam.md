## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Deerberry thrives in well-drained, acidic soil under partial to full sun conditions, typical of temperate woodlands. It requires moderate to low watering, preferring the soil to dry out between sessions, and has very low fertilizer needs. This makes it a relatively low-maintenance plant suited for its native environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Prefers lean, acidic soils; if needed, use a slow-release, acid-forming fertilizer very sparingly in early spring.
