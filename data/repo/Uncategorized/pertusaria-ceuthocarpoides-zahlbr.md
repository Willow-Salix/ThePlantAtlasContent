## 🌱 Overview
Pertusaria is a large genus of warty crustose lichens in the Pertusariaceae family. The fruiting bodies are usually modified apothecia that immersed in warts on the main body (thallus) with small holes for the spores to emerge, similar to ostioles, or are fully above and lecanorine (spore bearing discs surrounded by a ring of tissue similar to the tissue of the thallus.  Members of the genus are commonly called wart lichens.
The widespread genus contains over 500 species.
Classification in the large genus relies heavily on thallus chemistry to distinguish and classify species, some of which differ only in the presence or absence of a single secondary chemical. Lichexanthone, norlichexanthone, and their chlorinated derivatives are common in this genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pertusaria ceuthocarpoides is a lichen thriving in temperate forest conditions. It requires moderate, filtered light and high atmospheric humidity with regular moisture from rain or dew. It obtains all necessary nutrients from its environment, making traditional fertilization unnecessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required; nutrients are absorbed from airborne particles, rainwater, and the host substrate.
