## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Bog Goldenrod, replicate its native wetland conditions by providing full to partial sun and ensuring the soil remains consistently wet or waterlogged. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, so fertilizer should be applied sparingly, if at all.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; bog soils are typically nutrient-poor, so minimal or no fertilization is needed, and too much may harm the plant.
