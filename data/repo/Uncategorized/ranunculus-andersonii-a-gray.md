## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (Intermountain West, including Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Oregon, and California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Steppe / Subalpine Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun exposure. Thrives in open, unshaded areas or light shade found in sparse woodlands and sagebrush scrub. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth in spring, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Requires dry conditions during summer dormancy, mimicking natural snowmelt and spring rains followed by summer drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ranunculus  is a large genus of about 1750 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Members of the genus are known as buttercups, spearworts and water crowfoots.
The genus is distributed worldwide, primarily in temperate and montane regions. The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, which has extremely tough and tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much taller meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris. In ornamental  gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.
Buttercups usually flower in the spring, but flowers may be found throughout the summer, especially where the plants are growing as opportunistic colonizers, as in the case of garden weeds.
The water crowfoots (Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium), which grow in still or running water, are sometimes treated in a separate genus Batrachium (from Greek βάτραχος bátrakhos, "frog"). They have two different leaf types, thread-like leaves underwater and broader floating leaves. In some species, such as R. aquatilis, a third, intermediate leaf type occurs.
Ranunculus species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Hebrew character and small angle shades. Some species are popular ornamental flowers in horticulture, with many cultivars selected for large and brightly coloured flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Anderson's Buttercup, a native of the western US, prefers full to partial sun and thrives with moderate spring watering. It needs well-drained soil and drier conditions during its summer dormancy, typically requiring low to moderate fertilization. Mimic its natural environment of seasonal moisture followed by drought.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in early spring if soil is poor, but generally does not require heavy feeding.
