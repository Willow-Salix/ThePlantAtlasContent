| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (specifically inner North Coast Ranges, inner South Coast Ranges, and western Sierra Nevada foothills) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating full sun best where summers are not excessively hot or with adequate moisture during active growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular watering during its active growing season (late winter through spring). It needs a dry dormancy period in summer to prevent rot and mimic its native dry summer climate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Triteleia laxa (previously Brodiaea laxa) is a triplet lily known by several common names, including Ithuriel's spear, common triteleia and grassnut. It is native to California where it is a common wildflower, and it is occasionally found in southwestern Oregon. It bears a tall, naked stem topped with a spray of smaller stalks, each ending in a purple or blue flower. The flower is tubular, opening into a sharply six-pointed star. The plant grows from a corm which is edible and similar in taste and use as the potato. The most used common name for the species, Ithuriel's spear, is a reference to the angel Ithuriel from Milton's Paradise Lost.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean climate, requiring moist conditions during its winter/spring growth cycle and a completely dry, dormant period throughout the summer. Plant in full sun to partial shade in well-draining soil, and apply fertilizer sparingly during its active growing phase.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring during active growth is sufficient; often thrives with minimal supplemental feeding.
