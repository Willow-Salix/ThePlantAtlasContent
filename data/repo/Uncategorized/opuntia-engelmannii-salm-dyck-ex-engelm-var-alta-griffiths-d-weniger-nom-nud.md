## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid and Semi-Arid Desert, Chihuahuan Desert, Sonoran Desert, Desert Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun is essential, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. These plants thrive in intense, unobstructed light, typical of desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low watering needs. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during dormant periods. Overwatering is a common cause of rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Opuntia engelmannii is a prickly pear common across the south-central and Southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It goes by a variety of common names, including desert prickly pear, discus prickly pear, Engelmann's prickly pear in the US, and nopal, abrojo, joconostle, and vela de coyote in Mexico.
The nomenclatural history of this species is somewhat complicated due to the varieties, as well as its habit of hybridizing with Opuntia phaeacantha. It differs from Opuntia phaeacantha by being green year round instead of turning reddish purple during winter or dry seasons, as well as having yellow flowers with red centers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Engelmann's Prickly Pear requires ample direct sunlight and minimal watering, mimicking its native desert habitat. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, with infrequent fertilization. Ensure protection from excessive moisture and provide plenty of warmth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, using a low-nitrogen cactus or succulent fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer). Desert soils are typically lean.
