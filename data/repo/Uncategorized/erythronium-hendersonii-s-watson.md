## 🌱 Overview
Erythronium, the fawn lily, trout lily, dog's-tooth violet or adder's tongue, is a genus of Eurasian and North American plants in the lily family, most closely related to tulips. The name Erythronium derives from Ancient Greek ἐρυθρός (eruthrós) "red" in Greek, referring to the red flowers of E. dens-canis. Of all the established species, most live in North America; only six species are found in Europe and Asia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This spring ephemeral thrives in partial sun to dappled shade during its active growth in cool, moist spring conditions. Ensure consistently moist soil during this period, followed by a dry dormancy in summer to mimic its native Mediterranean habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers humus-rich, well-drained soil. A light application of balanced organic fertilizer or compost can be applied in early spring, but heavy feeding is not necessary.
