## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This North American native thrives in open, sunny locations with well-drained soil and moderate moisture. It is a low-maintenance plant that requires minimal fertilization and exhibits good drought tolerance once established in conditions mimicking its natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically no fertilizer is needed in average garden soils. If soil is very poor, a light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial.
