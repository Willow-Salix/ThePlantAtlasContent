## 🌱 Overview
Scutellaria is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. They are known commonly as skullcaps. The generic name is derived from the Latin scutella, meaning "a small dish, tray or platter", or "little dish", referring to the shape of the calyx. The common name alludes to the resemblance of the same structure to "miniature medieval helmets". The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution, with species occurring nearly worldwide, mainly in temperate regions.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant Mexican Skullcap thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its semi-arid native habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and use fertilizer very lightly to mimic its natural, less nutrient-rich environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of balanced fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient, or none if planted in good garden soil.
