## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Northeastern USA), Europe (e.g., UK, Scandinavia), and Northern Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Coastal Dune/Beach Ecosystems (Cool Temperate to Arctic/Boreal) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure is essential, as it naturally grows in open, unsheltered coastal environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires well-drained soil and can tolerate periods of dryness, reflecting its sandy coastal habitat. Regular watering is needed but ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Honckenya peploides, the sea sandwort (UK) or seaside sandplant (Canada), is the only species in the genus Honckenya of the plant family Caryophyllaceae. Other common names include sea chickweed, sea pimpernal, sea-beach sandwort, and sea purslane. The scientific name is often spelled "Honkenya", and is named after the German botanist Gerhard August Honckeny (or Honkeny). This plant has a circumboreal distribution.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Seaside Sandplant thrives in full sun and extremely well-drained, sandy soil, mirroring its native coastal dune habitat. While it appreciates regular moisture, it tolerates some dry periods and has very low fertilizer needs, adapting well to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils. Occasional light fertilization, if any, is sufficient.
