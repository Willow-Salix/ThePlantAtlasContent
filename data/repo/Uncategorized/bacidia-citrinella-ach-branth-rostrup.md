## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to partial sun, thriving in the filtered light conditions typical of a forest understory, often on shaded bark or rocks. |
| **💧 Water** | High atmospheric humidity and regular moisture from rain, dew, or mist are essential, as lichens absorb water directly from their environment and are highly sensitive to desiccation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bacidia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. These lichens are characterised by their crustose growth form, distinctive club-shaped reproductive structures called apothecia that contain long, needle-like spores, and their symbiotic partnership with green algae. Bacidia species typically grow on various substrates including tree bark, rock surfaces, and occasionally soil, and are distinguished from related genera by their specific spore characteristics and internal structures.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in stable, cool, and humid environments with clean air, typical of temperate and boreal forests. It requires low to partial light and moisture from ambient humidity or regular misting, rather than root watering, and does not need traditional fertilization. Ensuring a suitable substrate like tree bark or rock is also important for its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; lichens are largely self-sufficient, deriving necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate. Traditional fertilizers are generally detrimental and should be avoided.
