## 🌱 Overview
Cuscuta (), commonly known as dodder or amarbel, is a genus of over 201 species of yellow, orange, or red (rarely green) parasitic plants. Formerly treated as the only genus in the family Cuscutaceae, it now is accepted as belonging in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae, on the basis of the work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world, with the greatest species diversity in subtropical and tropical regions; the genus becomes rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern Europe.
Folk names include strangle tare, strangleweed, scaldweed, beggarweed, lady's laces, fireweed, wizard's net, devil's guts, devil's hair, devil's ringlet, goldthread, hailweed, hairweed, hellbine, love vine, pull-down, angel hair, and witch's hair.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Flax Dodder is a parasitic plant that obtains all its nutrients and water from a host, primarily flax. Cultivation focuses on maintaining a healthy host plant under full to partial sun exposure with consistent moisture. Direct care or fertilization of the dodder itself is not applicable.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No direct fertilizer is required for the dodder itself, as its nutritional needs are entirely met by parasitizing a healthy host plant.
