| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northeastern North America (specifically Quebec, Newfoundland, Labrador, Greenland) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic/Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers open, exposed conditions, reflecting its native treeless environment. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet, well-drained soil; high water needs, especially during active growth, often found near bogs or moist shores. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This dwarf willow thrives in cool temperatures with full sun exposure and consistently moist, well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor Arctic/Alpine tundra, it requires minimal to no fertilization, focusing instead on consistent moisture and cold hardiness.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to very low; adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, or peaty soils. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
