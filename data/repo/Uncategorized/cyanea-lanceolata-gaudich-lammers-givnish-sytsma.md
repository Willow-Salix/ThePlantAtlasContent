## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lanceleaf Cyanea requires conditions similar to its native Hawaiian wet forest habitat: bright indirect light, consistently moist well-draining soil, and high humidity. Fertilize sparingly during the growing season to support its growth without overwhelming it.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half or quarter strength, during the growing season (spring to fall). Mimics nutrient cycling from decaying organic matter.
