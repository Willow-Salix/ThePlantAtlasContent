## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native arid and high desert habitats. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to completely dry out between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or gravelly soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, using a very dilute, balanced fertilizer during the growing season.
