## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Great Basin region of Western United States (primarily Nevada and Utah) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Temperate Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open sagebrush communities. |
| **💧 Water** | Low; drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially once established, mimicking desert rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Paiute beardtongue is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant native to the arid Great Basin. It thrives in full sun and excellent drainage, preferring lean soils with minimal watering once established. Avoid overwatering and rich, heavy soils to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, as over-fertilization can reduce flowering and overall plant vigor.
