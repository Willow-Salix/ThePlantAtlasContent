## 🧤 Care Instructions
Phymosia thrives in sunny, well-draining conditions mimicking its native dry forest and scrubland habitats. Provide consistent watering during its growing season, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and reduce water significantly in winter. Light fertilization supports healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring, or a diluted liquid feed monthly during the active growing season. Avoid over-fertilization.
