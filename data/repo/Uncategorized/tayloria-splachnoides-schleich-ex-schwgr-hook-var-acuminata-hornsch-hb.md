## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine moss thrives in cool, highly humid environments with consistently moist substrate and very low, indirect light. Avoid direct sun and ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging while maintaining damp conditions. Fertilization is generally not required and should be minimal.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none; mosses have minimal nutrient needs and can be harmed by high concentrations of fertilizer. Use a highly diluted, specialized bryophyte fertilizer sparingly if at all.
