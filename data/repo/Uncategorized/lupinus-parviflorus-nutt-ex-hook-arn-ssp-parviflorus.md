## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lodgepole Lupine thrives in full sun and moderate moisture, typical of its native temperate montane habitats. It prefers lean, well-drained soils and requires little to no fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it a low-maintenance choice for appropriate climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers which can inhibit flowering. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils.
