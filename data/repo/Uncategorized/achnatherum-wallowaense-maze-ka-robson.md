## 🌱 Overview
Achnatherum is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It includes 20 species of needlegrass native to temperate Eurasia and North Africa. Several needlegrass species have been switched between Achnatherum and genus Stipa; taxonomy between the two closely related genera is still uncertain. In 2019 Peterson et al. reorganized the genera in tribe Stipeae based on molecular DNA studies, and placed the species from the Americas into other genera.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wallowa needlegrass thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, characteristic of its native montane grassland habitat. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization. This hardy perennial is best suited for dry, sunny garden spots.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; a light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring if desired, but often not necessary in adequately rich soil.
