## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern Oregon and northwestern California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (wet winters/springs, dry summers) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun exposure is ideal, mirroring its habitat in open meadows and grassy slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Needs consistent moisture during its active growth period in spring, followed by a dry dormancy period through summer and fall. Overwatering during dormancy can lead to rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Brodiaea , also known by the common name cluster-lilies, is a monocot genus of flowering plants.
One school of thought places the genus in the family Themidaceae, while another school of thought places it in the subfamily Brodiaeoideae of the family Asparagaceae.  The USDA Plants Database still classifies the genus Brodiaea in the family Liliaceae.
Brodiaea species occur along the Pacific Coast region of North America, from British Columbia throughout California into the Baja California Peninsula. They are especially common in northern California.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Henderson's Brodiaea thrives in full to partial sun with a distinct watering cycle, requiring consistent moisture during spring growth and a completely dry dormancy in summer. Due to its adaptation to poor soils, fertilizer should be used sparingly or avoided altogether.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is required, as this plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, including serpentine soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
