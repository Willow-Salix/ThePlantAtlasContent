## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Peru and Chile |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to semi-arid scrublands, rocky slopes, and open fields |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) as they thrive in open, exposed environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent but deep watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, reflecting their adaptation to dry seasons. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gilia, originating from arid to semi-arid regions of Peru and Chile, requires full sun and well-draining soil. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and use fertilizer sparingly. This strategy mimics their natural habitat's open, dry conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer. Native soils are often poor to moderately fertile, so excessive fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental.
