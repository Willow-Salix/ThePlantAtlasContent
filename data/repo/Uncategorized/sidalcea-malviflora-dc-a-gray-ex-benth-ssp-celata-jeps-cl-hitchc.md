## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, primarily California (USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (Chaparral, Grasslands, Oak Woodlands) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives with ample direct sunlight for most of the day, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, especially during its active growing season in spring. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring less water in summer when dormant or semi-dormant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny to partly shaded locations and prefers well-draining soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, especially once established as it is drought-tolerant. Fertilizer needs are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to less fertile native soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native to soils that are not overly rich. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or it can often thrive in average garden soil without supplemental feeding.
