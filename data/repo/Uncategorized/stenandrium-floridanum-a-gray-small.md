## 🧤 Care Instructions
Florida Tweedisia thrives in subtropical environments, preferring partial sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. Mimic its native habitat by providing moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and use fertilizer sparingly. This ensures a healthy plant adapted to its natural wet and dry cycles.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the growing season, but it is not a heavy feeder and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils.
