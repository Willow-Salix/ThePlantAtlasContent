## 🌱 Overview
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stiff Goldenrod thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native prairie and open woodland habitats. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering only during prolonged dry spells. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it prefers average to lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; thrives in average to lean, well-draining soils, as it's accustomed to naturally fertile yet not overly rich prairie conditions.
