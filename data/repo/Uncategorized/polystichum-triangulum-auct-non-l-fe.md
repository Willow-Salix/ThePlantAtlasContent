## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Western Sword Fern thrives in cool, moist, and shady conditions, mimicking its native temperate forest floor habitat. Ensure consistently moist, well-draining soil and protect it from any direct afternoon sun exposure. Fertilize lightly with organic matter once a year for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder. Benefits from an annual application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or a top-dressing of organic compost in spring. Avoid heavy fertilization.
