| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Santa Cruz Islands |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a native of tropical rainforests, Soft Timonius thrives in high humidity and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide bright, indirect light and protect it from harsh direct sun, along with regular feeding during warmer months to support its lush growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding during its active growing season (spring and summer). Use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks.
