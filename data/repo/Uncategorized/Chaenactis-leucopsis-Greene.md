## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland environment, requiring full sun and excellent drainage. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization as it prefers lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; thrives in lean, poor soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
