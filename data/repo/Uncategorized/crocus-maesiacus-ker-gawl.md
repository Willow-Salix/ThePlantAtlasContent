## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe, including the Alps, Pyrenees, and Carpathians. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Alpine/Subalpine Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun during its active early spring growth for optimal blooming, often before deciduous trees fully leaf out. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to moist during active growth in early spring; allow soil to dry out between waterings. Keep largely dry during summer dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Crocus vernus (spring crocus, giant crocus) is a species of flowering plant in the family Iridaceae, native to the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the Balkans. Its cultivars and those of Crocus flavus (Dutch crocus) are used as ornamental plants. The Dutch crocuses are larger than the other cultivated crocus species (e.g., Crocus chrysanthus).  Depending on the year, Crocus vernus starts flowering about the same time or up to 2 weeks after Crocus chrysanthus (snow crocus) starts flowering.  Height: 4–6 inches (10–15 cm).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This spring-blooming bulb thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moist, well-drained soil during its active growth in early spring. After blooming, allow foliage to die back naturally and keep the soil relatively dry during its summer dormancy to ensure successful re-blooming next year. Minimal fertilization is needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced bulb fertilizer in early spring as new growth emerges is sufficient, especially in lean soils.
