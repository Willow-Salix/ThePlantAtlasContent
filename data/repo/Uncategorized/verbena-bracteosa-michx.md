## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring moderate watering during active growth but tolerating periods of drought. Minimal fertilization is needed, making it a low-maintenance choice for open, naturalized garden settings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it naturally grows in disturbed or less fertile soils. Excessive fertilizer can lead to leggy growth.
