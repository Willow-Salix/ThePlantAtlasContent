## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Indian Subcontinent (e.g., India, Pakistan), Afghanistan, parts of Iran, extending into some arid regions of North Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Semi-Arid Deserts (e.g., Thar Desert), dry thorn forests. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with its native open, exposed desert and scrubland habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires very minimal water once established, mimicking its adaptation to low rainfall environments. |

## 🌱 Overview
Jujube (UK ; US  or ), sometimes jujuba, scientific name Ziziphus jujuba, and also called red date, Chinese date, and Chinese jujube, is a species in the genus Ziziphus in the buckthorn family Rhamnaceae. It is often confused with the closely related Indian jujube, Z. mauritiana. The Chinese jujube tolerates a diverse range of climates, from temperate to tropical. Its origin is thought to be in southwest Asia, but it has been widely dispersed through cultivation, and is today cultivated in gardens as a shrub as well as in agriculture as a food crop. They are eaten freshly harvested as well as dried and candied.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ziziphus nummularia is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun. It requires minimal watering once established and can tolerate poor soil conditions, reflecting its origins in arid and semi-arid scrublands and deserts. Fertilization is generally not necessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy, or rocky soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, or use a balanced, slow-release formula during active growth, as rich soils are not typical of its native environment.
