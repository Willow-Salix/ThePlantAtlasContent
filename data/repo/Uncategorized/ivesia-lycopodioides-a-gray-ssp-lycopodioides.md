## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and requires well-drained, rocky soil, mimicking its native high-elevation habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and avoid heavy fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring, or may not require any regular fertilization.
