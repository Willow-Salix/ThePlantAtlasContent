## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal California, USA (parent species) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) for best flowering and health. |
| **💧 Water** | Low. Highly drought-tolerant once established; water infrequently and deeply, primarily during its active growing season (cooler months) and avoid regular summer watering once mature. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ceanothus is a genus of about 50–60 species of nitrogen-fixing shrubs and small trees in the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae). Common names for members of this genus are buckbrush, California lilac, soap bush, or just ceanothus. "Ceanothus" comes from Ancient Greek: κεάνωθος (keánōthos), which was applied by Theophrastus (371–287 BC) to an Old World plant believed to be Cirsium arvense.
The genus is native to North America with the highest diversity on the western coast. Some species (e.g., C. americanus) are restricted to the eastern United States and southeast Canada, and others (e.g., C. caeruleus) extend as far south as Guatemala. Most are shrubs 0.5–3 metres (1.6–9.8 ft) tall, but C. arboreus and C. thyrsiflorus, both native to California, can be small multi-trunked trees up to 6–7 metres (20–23 ft) tall.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid Ceanothus thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its Mediterranean shrubland origins. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent deep watering and minimal fertilization, particularly avoiding high nitrogen feeds.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils; avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers, which can be detrimental.
