## 🌱 Overview
Bacidia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. These lichens are characterised by their crustose growth form, distinctive club-shaped reproductive structures called apothecia that contain long, needle-like spores, and their symbiotic partnership with green algae. Bacidia species typically grow on various substrates including tree bark, rock surfaces, and occasionally soil, and are distinguished from related genera by their specific spore characteristics and internal structures.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This oceanic lichen thrives in high humidity and bright indirect light to partial shade. Mimicking its native temperate oceanic climate, ensure consistent moisture through misting without prolonged saturation. Traditional fertilizers are detrimental; it acquires nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers; obtains necessary nutrients from the air and substrate. Fertilizers can be harmful.
