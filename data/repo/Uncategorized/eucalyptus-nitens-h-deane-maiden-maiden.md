## 🌱 Overview
Eucalyptus nitens, commonly known as shining gum or silvertop, is a species of tall tree native to Victoria and eastern New South Wales. It has smooth greyish bark, sometimes with thin, rough bark near the base, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven or nine, white flowers and cup-shaped, barrel-shaped or cylindrical fruit. It grows in wet forests and rainforest margins on fertile soils in cool, high-rainfall areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To cultivate Shining Gum, ensure it receives full sun exposure and maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, particularly when young. As it thrives in naturally low-nutrient conditions, fertilizer should be applied sparingly, if at all. Provide good drainage to prevent waterlogging.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to relatively poor soils; heavy fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental. If needed, use a low-phosphorus, balanced fertilizer sparingly for young trees.
