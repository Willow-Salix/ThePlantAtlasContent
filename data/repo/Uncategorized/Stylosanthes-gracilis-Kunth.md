## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tropical Stylo thrives in full sun within tropical and subtropical climates, adapting well to moderate watering during its growing season and showing high drought tolerance. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it requires minimal fertilization. This makes it a resilient and relatively low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Benefits from phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients, especially in nutrient-poor soils, but generally does not require heavy fertilization.
