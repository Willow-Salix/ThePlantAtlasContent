## 🧤 Care Instructions
Haresfoot Grass thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native tropical savanna environment. It requires moderate watering during its active growth period, with an ability to withstand dry spells. Minimal fertilization is typically sufficient for this resilient grass species.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to naturally occurring soil fertility in savanna environments. Over-fertilization is likely unnecessary.
