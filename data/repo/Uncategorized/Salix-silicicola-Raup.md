## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This subarctic willow thrives in consistently moist to wet soil and prefers full to partial sun exposure. Mimic its native wetland habitat by ensuring constant soil moisture and providing light to moderate fertilization during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season, particularly if soil is poor; minimal needs in rich soil
