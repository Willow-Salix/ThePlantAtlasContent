## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tropic Trypethelium Lichen thrives in warm, humid environments with filtered light, typical of tropical rainforests. It requires high atmospheric humidity and consistent moisture from misting or rain, absorbing all necessary nutrients directly from the air and water, thus needing no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None required. Lichens are self-sufficient, absorbing all necessary nutrients directly from the air and rainfall; artificial fertilizers can be detrimental.
