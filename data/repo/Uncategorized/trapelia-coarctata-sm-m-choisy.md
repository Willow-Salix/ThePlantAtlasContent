## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Zone (Saxicolous Habitat), often found on exposed siliceous rocks, walls, and acid bark in open woodlands, montane areas, and coastal regions. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers moderate to high sun exposure, commonly found on open, exposed rock surfaces. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular atmospheric moisture from rain, dew, or humidity, followed by periods of drying. Good air circulation is crucial to prevent prolonged dampness. |

## 🌱 Overview
Trapelia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Trapeliaceae. These lichens form tight, crusty patches on rocks and bark that may appear smooth at first but often crack into small plates over time. The genus was established by the French lichenologist Maurice Choisy in 1929 and contains more than 20 species found worldwide. Most species reproduce through small, disc-shaped fruiting bodies that range from pale pink-brown to nearly black, and many can be identified by specific chemical compounds they produce.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for this saxicolous lichen, provide moderate to high light conditions, mimicking its natural habitat on exposed rocks. Ensure it receives regular atmospheric moisture from rain or dew, followed by periods of dryness and good air circulation. Avoid any artificial fertilization as it is highly sensitive to external nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is needed. Lichens are highly sensitive to external nutrients and pollutants; artificial fertilization can be detrimental.
