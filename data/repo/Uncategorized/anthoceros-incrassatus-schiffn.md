## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hornwort thrives in consistently moist, humid, and shaded conditions reminiscent of its native tropical/subtropical forest floor. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging and rot, while maintaining high atmospheric humidity and constant substrate dampness. Fertilization needs are minimal due to its nature as a bryophyte.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; if used, a highly diluted liquid bryophyte-specific fertilizer once or twice a year is sufficient.
