## 🌱 Overview
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical lichen thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, typically found on rocks or tree bark. Provide regular hydration through misting or high ambient moisture, ensuring it dries completely between events to prevent fungal issues. Fertilization is not necessary and can be detrimental to its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No supplemental fertilizer needed. Lichens derive necessary nutrients from the air and substrate and are sensitive to added chemicals.
