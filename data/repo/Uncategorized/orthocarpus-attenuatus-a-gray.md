## 🌱 Overview
Orthocarpus, or owl's-clover,  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae (broomrapes). They are native to North America. A number of species formerly included in Orthocarpus have been transferred to the genus Castilleja, which includes the plants commonly known as Indian paintbrush. Plants of the genus are generally less than 30 centimetres (1 ft) in height.
Like their close relatives in genus Castilleja, Orthocarpus are root hemiparasites, capable of photosynthesis but extracting water and mineral nutrients through attachment to the roots of host plants.
Some animal species such as the Edith's checkerspot butterfly use these plants as hosts during ovipositing.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pointed Owl's Clover is an annual native to Western North America, preferring sunny locations with well-draining soil. It requires moderate watering during its active growth period from winter through spring, followed by reduced watering as it completes its life cycle. Fertilization should be light, as it is adapted to leaner soils and can draw nutrients from host plants.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be beneficial at the start of the growing season if soil is poor, but avoid over-fertilization due to its hemiparasitic nature.
