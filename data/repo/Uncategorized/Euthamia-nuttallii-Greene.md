## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Eastern United States (primarily Great Plains, Midwest, and parts of the Southeast) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie and Open Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) to partial sun (4-6 hours direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil. Regular watering is needed, especially during dry spells, though it can tolerate some drought once established, characteristic of temperate prairie rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Euthamia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. They are known as goldentops and grass-leaved goldenrods.
The species were formerly classed in genus Solidago. They were separated on the basis of morphological differences, such as the arrangement of the flower heads in the inflorescence and the glands on the leaves, and of DNA data. Authors have recognized 5 to 10 species. They are native to North America, but certain species are introduced in Europe and Asia.
These species are quite variable in appearance, the variation often influenced by environmental conditions. In general, they are rhizomatous perennial herbs or subshrubs growing erect stems 0.4–2 m (1 ft 4 in – 6 ft 7 in) tall. The stems are hairy to hairless and branching or unbranched. The leaves are alternately arranged along the stem. They are linear to lance-shaped, smooth-edged, hairy to hairless, and gland-dotted, if sometimes sparsely. The flower heads are solitary or borne in a dense or spreading array. The back of the head is layered in phyllaries which may be resinous. There are 7 to 22 yellow ray florets, sometimes more, and several yellow disc florets. The fruit is a rough-textured cypsela tipped with a pappus of white bristles.
Euthamia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora intermediella, which feeds exclusively on E. graminifolia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This goldenrod flourishes in full sun and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, typical of its native open grassland and woodland environments. It is a low-maintenance plant regarding nutrient needs, generally thriving with minimal fertilization. Provide ample light and consistent moisture for the best growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization; a light annual feeding in spring with a balanced fertilizer is sufficient if soil quality is very low.
