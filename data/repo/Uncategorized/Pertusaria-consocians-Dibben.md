## 🌱 Overview
Pertusaria is a large genus of warty crustose lichens in the Pertusariaceae family. The fruiting bodies are usually modified apothecia that immersed in warts on the main body (thallus) with small holes for the spores to emerge, similar to ostioles, or are fully above and lecanorine (spore bearing discs surrounded by a ring of tissue similar to the tissue of the thallus.  Members of the genus are commonly called wart lichens.
The widespread genus contains over 500 species.
Classification in the large genus relies heavily on thallus chemistry to distinguish and classify species, some of which differ only in the presence or absence of a single secondary chemical. Lichexanthone, norlichexanthone, and their chlorinated derivatives are common in this genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pertusaria consocians is a lichen that thrives in consistently humid, low-light environments, mirroring its native temperate forest understory. It requires clean air and moisture absorbed directly from its surroundings, meaning no traditional watering or fertilization is needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and precipitation; traditional fertilizers are detrimental.
