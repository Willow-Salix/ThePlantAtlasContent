## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy, nitrogen-fixing shrub thrives in cool, moist conditions, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it has low to moderate fertilizer needs. It's well-suited for cooler climates, riverbanks, or open, disturbed sites.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; as a nitrogen-fixer, it can improve soil fertility and typically does not require high nitrogen fertilization
