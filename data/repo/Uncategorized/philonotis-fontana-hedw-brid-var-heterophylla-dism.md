## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss requires a consistently wet environment with high humidity, mimicking its natural boggy or spring-fed habitats. Provide low to medium light, avoiding direct sun. Fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental to its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required. Mosses absorb nutrients from water and air; over-fertilization can be harmful.
