## 🧤 Care Instructions
Anthoceros reticulatus thrives in high humidity and consistently moist conditions, replicating its native tropical forest floor environment. Provide low to moderate indirect light and protect it from direct sun. Fertilization should be minimal, if at all, given its low nutrient demands.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; bryophytes obtain most nutrients from air and water. If fertilization is deemed necessary, use an extremely diluted (e.g., 1/8 to 1/4 strength) balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly.
