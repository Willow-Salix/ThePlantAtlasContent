## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mountainous regions of Temperate and Boreal Europe and North America (e.g., Alps, Fennoscandia, Rocky Mountains). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Montane zones. |
| **☀️ Light** | High exposure; thrives in direct sunlight on exposed rock surfaces, adapted to high UV radiation in alpine/montane environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Atmospheric moisture dependent; requires periods of saturation from rain, snowmelt, or dew, followed by periods of dryness. Does not require watering in a traditional sense. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a saxicolous lichen, Lecidella bullata thrives on exposed, siliceous rocks in cool, high-altitude environments with ample direct sunlight. Its primary moisture source is atmospheric (rain, snowmelt), allowing it to endure dry periods, and it requires no conventional fertilization, deriving nutrients from its surroundings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low; obtains necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rain) and minerals leached from the rock substrate. Traditional fertilizers are detrimental.
