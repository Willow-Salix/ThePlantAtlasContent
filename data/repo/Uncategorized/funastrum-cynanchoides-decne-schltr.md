## 🧤 Care Instructions
To mimic its native arid scrubland environment, Fringed Twinevine requires full sun and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing deep but infrequent watering with the soil completely drying between sessions. Fertilization should be minimal, applied sparingly during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; thrives in lean soils. A light application of a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich soil.
