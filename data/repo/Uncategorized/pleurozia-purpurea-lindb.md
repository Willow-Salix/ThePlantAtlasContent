## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |

| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Oceanic Bog/Heathland |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade; avoid direct, intense sun as it can dry out and scorch the delicate plant. |
| **💧 Water** | Substrate must be kept consistently moist to wet, never allowing it to dry out. Requires very high atmospheric humidity, often best achieved in a terrarium or bog garden setting. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pleurozia purpurea thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate oceanic bog habitat, requiring consistently moist, acidic substrate and very high humidity. Provide bright indirect light, protect from direct sun, and fertilize minimally due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low; adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic substrates. If necessary, use an extremely dilute (e.g., 1/10th strength) balanced liquid fertilizer once a year, or avoid entirely.
