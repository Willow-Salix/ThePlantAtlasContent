## 🌱 Overview
Laburnum, sometimes called golden chain or golden rain, is a genus of two species of small trees in the subfamily Faboideae of the pea family Fabaceae. The species are Laburnum anagyroides—common laburnum and Laburnum alpinum—alpine laburnum. They are native to the mountains of southern Europe from France to the Balkans.
Some botanists include a third species, Laburnum caramanicum, but this native of southeast Europe and Anatolia is usually treated in a distinct genus Podocytisus, more closely allied to the Genisteae (brooms).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Golden Chain Tree flourishes in temperate conditions, favoring full sun to light shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its European woodland origins. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it generally needs minimal fertilization. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, to support its health and vibrant floral display.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen, so supplemental fertilization is rarely necessary. If growth appears weak, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial.
