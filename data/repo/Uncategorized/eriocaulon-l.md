## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pipeworts thrive in consistently wet to waterlogged conditions with ample bright light. They are best suited for bog gardens or aquatic setups, requiring low to moderate fertilization to prevent nutrient overload.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization is generally sufficient, as many species are adapted to nutrient-poor wetland soils. Use a diluted, balanced fertilizer if needed.
