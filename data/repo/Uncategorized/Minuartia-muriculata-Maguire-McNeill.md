## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (California, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Arizona) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane / Alpine |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure, mimicking its open, high-altitude habitat where it is not shaded by dense canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the spring and early summer growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established, adapting to periodic moisture from snowmelt and sparse rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Minuartia is a genus of flowering plants commonly known as sandworts in the family Caryophyllaceae.
Minuartias are small annual or perennial plants which grow in otherwise inhospitable conditions such as on rocky ledges and in stony soil. Species are distributed in Eurasia and parts of Africa, including Europe, the Mediterranean region, northern and eastern Africa, the Caucasus, western and central Asia, Japan, and Far Eastern Russia.
Many Minuartia species were formerly classed in the genus Arenaria, and the obsolete genus Alsine. In 2014, the polyphyletic Minuartia sensu lato was recircumscribed, with many of the species transferred to other genera, including Cherleria, Eremogone, Facchinia, Mcneillia, Minuartiella, Mononeuria, Pseudocherleria, Rhodalsine, Sabulina, and Triplateia. Minuartia sensu stricto is characterized by the following features: leaves linear-setaceous; 5 acute sepals with 3, 5, or 9-veins; 5 white petals; 3 styles, forming 3-parted capsules.
The genus was named for Juan Minuart (1693–1768), a Spanish botanist and pharmacist.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Muricled Sandwort thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean, rocky soils, reflecting its native alpine habitat in the western U.S. Provide moderate water during its active growth period, allowing for dry spells, and avoid heavy fertilization to mimic its natural conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils found in its native montane environment and does not require regular fertilization.
