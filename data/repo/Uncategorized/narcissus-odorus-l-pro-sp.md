## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mimicking its Mediterranean origin, the Campernelle Jonquil thrives with a distinct seasonal care approach. It requires full sun and consistent moisture during its active growth and flowering in the cooler months, followed by a dry dormancy in summer with reduced watering to prevent rot. Ensure well-draining soil for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization is sufficient; apply a balanced bulb fertilizer in late winter or early spring as new growth emerges, and potentially again after flowering.
