## 🧤 Care Instructions
American vetch thrives in temperate climates with full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering, preferring consistently moist but well-drained soil, and has low fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. It's a hardy plant adaptable to various soil types and often found in open, disturbed areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally doesn't require additional nitrogen. If soil is very poor, a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer or compost application in spring may be beneficial.
