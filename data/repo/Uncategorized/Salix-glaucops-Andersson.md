## 🌱 Overview
Salix discolor, the American pussy willow or glaucous willow, is a species of willow native to North America, one of two species commonly called pussy willow.
It is native to the vast reaches of Alaska as well as the northern forests and wetlands of Canada (British Columbia east to Newfoundland), and is also found in the northern portions of the contiguous United States (Washington east to Maine, and south to Maryland).
It is a weak-wooded deciduous shrub or small tree growing to 6 m (20 ft) tall, with brown shoots. The leaves are oval, 3–14 cm long and 1–3.5 cm broad, green above and downy grey-white beneath.
The flowers are soft silky silvery catkins, borne in early spring before the new leaves appear, with the male and female catkins on different plants (dioecious); the male catkins mature yellow at pollen release.
The fruit is a small capsule 7–12 mm long containing numerous minute seeds embedded in cottony down.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Glaucous Willow, native to cold arctic and alpine regions, thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil. It is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, so minimal fertilization is needed. Providing adequate moisture and bright light will ensure optimal growth for this resilient plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. These plants are adapted to nutrient-poor soils; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient if growth appears weak, otherwise, it's often not necessary.
