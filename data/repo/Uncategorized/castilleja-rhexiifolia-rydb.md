## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Rocky Mountains and intermontane regions of the United States (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho) and Canada (e.g., British Columbia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Subalpine Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in high light exposure common in open mountain meadows and slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to consistent moisture. Soil should be moist but well-drained, mimicking conditions from snowmelt and regular rainfall in mountain environments. Avoid prolonged drought or waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hemiparasitic wildflower thrives in full sun and well-drained, consistently moist soil, typical of its native subalpine meadows. It critically requires host plants for nutrient uptake, making rich, fertilized soil undesirable for its successful cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. As a hemiparasitic plant, it obtains some nutrients and water by tapping into the roots of neighboring host plants (often grasses or forbs). Rich or heavily fertilized soils can be detrimental; it prefers lean, native-like soil.
