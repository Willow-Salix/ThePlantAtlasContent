## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (specifically central and southern regions) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (Chaparral and Woodlands) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers full sun exposure for optimal growth and flowering, reflecting its open habitat in its native range. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during its active growth and flowering season in spring. Tolerates drought conditions once established, aligning with its native dry summer climate; reduce water significantly after blooming. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clarkia is a genus within the flowering plant family Onagraceae.  Over 40 species are currently classified in Clarkia; almost all are native to western North America, though one species (Clarkia tenella) is native to South America.
Clarkias are typically annual herbs, growing either prostrate or erect to a height of less than 2 metres.  Their leaves are small and simple, from 1 to 10 cm in length depending on the species.  Their flowers have four sepals and four petals, usually white, pink, or red, and are often spotted or streaked. Their fruit are elongated, cylindrical pods, usually 4-grooved or 8-grooved, and when mature they hold many tiny, cubical seeds.
Several members of the genus are sometimes referred to by the common name "godetia", including Clarkia amoena, Clarkia affinis, and Clarkia lassenensis (the Lassen godetia).  This is because they were formerly classified in a genus called Godetia, which is no longer recognised since its members have been absorbed into the genus Clarkia.  Older sources may still use Godetia as a genus name.
The genus was named in honour of the explorer Captain William Clark. Unofficially, the genus is sometimes referred to as Yorkia, in honor of York, an African-American member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.
The Royal Navy had a warship called HMS Clarkia, a Flower-class corvette.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Redspot Clarkia thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native California Mediterranean habitat. Provide moderate water during its spring growth and bloom, then allow it to experience drier conditions, as it is adapted to summer drought. Fertilize minimally, as rich soils can inhibit blooming.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization is generally not needed and can sometimes inhibit flowering.
