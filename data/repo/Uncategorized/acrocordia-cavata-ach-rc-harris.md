## 🌱 Overview
Acrocordia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Monoblastiaceae. These lichens form thin, whitish to pale grey crusts on tree bark and rocks, appearing as scattered black dots where their tiny flask-shaped reproductive structures emerge from the surface. The genus includes nine species found in various parts of the world, typically growing in mildly alkaline environments on broad-leaved trees or damp, mineral-rich rock faces.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen thrives in a consistently humid environment with good air circulation and low, indirect light, mimicking its natural temperate forest habitat. Avoid direct sunlight and do not apply any fertilizers, as it is highly sensitive to nutrient changes and pollution, absorbing what it needs from the atmosphere.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None; lichens are highly sensitive to nutrient enrichment and pollutants, obtaining necessary nutrients from the air and precipitation.
