## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This sedge thrives in cool, moist conditions typical of subalpine wet meadows. Provide ample sunlight (full to partial) and ensure the soil remains consistently wet. Nutrient requirements are low, mimicking its natural, often nutrient-poor, boggy habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, adapted to nutrient-poor or moderately fertile wet soils
