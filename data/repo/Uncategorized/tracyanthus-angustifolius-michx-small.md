## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Narrow-leaf Tracyanthus, provide full to partial sun and maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting its humid subtropical coastal plain origin. It tolerates wet conditions but prefers good drainage; light fertilization may be beneficial in spring.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula in early spring is generally sufficient, or none if grown in naturally rich soil, as it's adapted to less nutrient-dense environments.
