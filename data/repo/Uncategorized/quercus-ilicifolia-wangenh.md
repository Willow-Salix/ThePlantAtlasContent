## 🌱 Overview
Quercus ilicifolia, commonly known as bear oak or scrub oak, is a small shrubby oak native to the Eastern United States and, less commonly, in southeastern Canada.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Bear Oak thrives in full sun and very well-drained, acidic, nutrient-poor soils, making it exceptionally drought-tolerant once established. It requires minimal watering and fertilization, reflecting its natural habitat on dry barrens and rocky slopes. This species is ideal for challenging garden spots where other plants might struggle.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Naturally grows in poor, acidic soils; excessive fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
