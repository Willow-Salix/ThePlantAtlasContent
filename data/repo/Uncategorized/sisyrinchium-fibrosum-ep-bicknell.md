## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, North and South Carolina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical, Temperate Wetlands and Bogs |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, bright locations, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil. Requires abundant water and should not be allowed to dry out, especially during active growth. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sisyrinchium is a large genus of annual to perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. Native to the New World, the species are known as blue-eyed grasses. Although they are not true grasses (Poaceae), they are monocots.
Several species in the eastern United States are threatened or endangered. This may be due to niche species emerging from their unique tendency toward rapid speciation which helps them adapt to specialized arenic (sandy) habitats.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wetland native requires consistently moist to wet soil and thrives in full to partial sun. Avoid allowing the soil to dry out, as it does not tolerate drought. It has low to moderate fertilizer needs, preferring less rich environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient for container plants; generally not a heavy feeder.
