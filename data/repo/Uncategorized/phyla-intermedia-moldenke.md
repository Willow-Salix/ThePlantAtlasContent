## 🌱 Overview
Phyla  is a genus of eustarid plants in the verbena family, Verbenaceae. The name is derived from the Greek word φυλή (phyle), meaning "tribe", and most likely refers to the tightly clustered flowers or the spreading, mat-like growth. Members of the genus are known generally as fogfruit or frogfruit. Species once classified in the genus Lippia may be known by the common name lippia. Some species, e.g. Aztec Sweet Herb (P. dulcis), are used in cooking.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid fogfruit thrives in full sun to partial shade and demands consistently moist soil, reflecting its native humid subtropical environment near water sources. It's not a heavy feeder, requiring low to moderate fertilization to support its adaptable and vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; it generally adapts well to varied soil fertility. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly once in spring if growth appears sluggish, but it often performs well without heavy feeding.
