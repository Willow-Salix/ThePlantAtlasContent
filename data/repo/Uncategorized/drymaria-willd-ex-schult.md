## 🧤 Care Instructions
Drymary thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright indirect light or partial shade. Maintain consistently moist soil, allowing the very top layer to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilize sparingly during its active growth period to support healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer), typically monthly or bi-monthly.
