## 🌱 Overview
Tradescantia () is a genus of 85 species of herbaceous perennial wildflowers in the family Commelinaceae, native to the Americas from southern Canada to northern Argentina, including the West Indies. Members of the genus are known by many common names, including inchplant, wandering jew, spiderwort, dayflower and trad.
Tradescantia grow 30–60 cm  tall (1–2 ft), and are commonly found individually or in clumps in wooded areas and open fields. They were introduced into Europe as ornamental plants in the 17th century and are now grown in many parts of the world. Some species have become naturalized in regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and on some oceanic islands.
The genus's many species are of interest to cytogenetics because of evolutionary changes in the structure and number of their chromosomes. They have also been used as bioindicators for the detection of environmental mutagens. Some species have become pests to cultivated crops and considered invasive.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This spiderwort prefers partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its native woodland habitat. It thrives with regular watering and benefits from occasional feeding during the active growing season. Protect from harsh direct sun to prevent leaf scorch.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Its native environment provides rich, humus-filled soil. Fertilize with a balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength once a month during the growing season (spring through summer).
