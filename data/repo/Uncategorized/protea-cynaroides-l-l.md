## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Cape Floral Region, South Africa |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (Fynbos biome) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during the dry summer months in its native climate. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Protea cynaroides, also called the king protea (from Afrikaans: koningsprotea, Xhosa: isiQwane sobukumkani), is a flowering plant. It is a distinctive member of Protea, having the largest flower head in the genus. The species is also known as giant protea, honeypot, or king sugar bush. It is widely distributed in the fynbos region of South Africa, that is, in the southwestern and southern parts of Western Cape. The king protea is the national flower of South Africa. 
Protea cynaroides is adapted to survive wildfires by its thick underground stem, which contains many dormant buds; these will produce the new growth after the fire.
The flower has a long vase life in flower arrangements, and makes for an excellent dried flower.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The King Protea demands full sun and well-draining, acidic, nutrient-poor soil, typical of its Fynbos origins. It thrives with infrequent deep watering and is highly sensitive to phosphorus, necessitating little to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely sensitive to phosphorus. Requires very little to no fertilizer. If necessary, use a specialized phosphorus-free or very low-phosphorus fertilizer for proteaceae, as native soils are nutrient-poor and acidic.
