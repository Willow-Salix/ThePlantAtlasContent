## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss requires conditions that mimic its native shaded, humid forest understory habitat. Ensure constant moisture for the substrate, maintain very high ambient humidity, and provide very low light levels. Fertilization is generally unnecessary and should be avoided.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; mosses have extremely low nutrient needs and can be harmed by excessive fertilization.
