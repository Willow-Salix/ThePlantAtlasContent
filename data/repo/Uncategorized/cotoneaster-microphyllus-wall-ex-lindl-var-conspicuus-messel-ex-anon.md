| **🌍 Origin** | Himalayan region (Nepal, Bhutan, India, China/Tibet) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Subalpine Scrubland and Rocky Slopes |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers full sun for optimal growth, flowering, and berry production. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, regular watering is needed for establishment. Once mature, it is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, thriving in well-drained soil. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cotoneaster  is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, native to the Palaearctic region (temperate Asia, Europe, north Africa), with a strong concentration of diversity in the genus in the mountains of southwestern China and the Himalayas. They are related to hawthorns (Crataegus), firethorns (Pyracantha), photinias (Photinia), and rowans (Sorbus).
Depending on the species definition used, between 70 and 300 different species of Cotoneaster are described, with many apomictic microspecies treated as species by some authors, but only as varieties by others.
The majority of species are shrubs from 0.5–5 m (1.6–16.4 ft) tall, varying from ground-hugging prostrate plants to erect shrubs; a few, notably C. frigidus, are small trees up to 15 m (49 ft) tall and 75 cm (30 in) trunk diameter. The prostrate species are mostly alpine plants growing at high altitudes (e.g. C. integrifolius, which grows at 3,000–4,000 m (9,800–13,100 ft) in the Himalayas), while the larger species occur in scrub and woodland gaps at lower altitudes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy Himalayan shrub flourishes in full sun and well-drained conditions, tolerating drought once established. It needs moderate watering during dry periods and generally minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance landscape plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It typically thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in early spring is sufficient, especially if growth appears weak.
