## 🌱 Overview
Ptelea is a genus of flowering plants in the citrus family, Rutaceae. The name, of Greek derivation, is the classical name of the elm tree. Carl Linnaeus used that word for this genus because of the resemblance of its fruit to that of the elm. Members of the genus are commonly known as hoptrees.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native dry woodlands. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and fertilize sparingly as it is well-suited to leaner conditions once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically adapts to average to poor soils. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient if needed.
