## 🌱 Overview
Sulcaria is a genus of three species of fruticose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. Sulcaria was circumscribed by lichenologist Jan Bystrek in 1971. These lichens form hair-like or rope-like structures that hang from or grow upright on tree bark, with branches that develop distinctive lengthwise grooves as they age. They reproduce through disc-shaped fruiting bodies that contain large, dark brown spores with two unequal cells.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light, mimicking its native boreal and subalpine habitats. Maintain high ambient moisture through misting and avoid any form of direct fertilization, as it absorbs nutrients from the air.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed. Lichens are sensitive to external nutrients and pollutants.
