## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and South America, including Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, The Guianas, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, and parts of the Caribbean (e.g., Trinidad & Tobago) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers bright, indirect light, mimicking its natural habitat as an understory or climbing plant in dense canopy. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch leaves. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture in the growing medium, but with excellent drainage, typical of a rainforest floor or epiphyte. Water when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry, ensuring it never dries out completely. High ambient humidity is also critical. |

## 🌱 Overview
Philodendron is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. As of September 2025, the Plants of the World Online accepted 625 species; other sources accept different numbers. Regardless of number of species, the genus is the second-largest member of the family Araceae, after genus Anthurium. Taxonomically, the genus Philodendron is still poorly known, with many undescribed species. Many are grown as ornamental and indoor plants. The name derives from the Greek words philo- 'love, affection' and dendron 'tree'. The generic name, Philodendron, is often used as the English name.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Lingulatum Philodendron flourishes in conditions that replicate its tropical rainforest origin, demanding bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. High humidity is essential for its well-being. Regular feeding during growth periods supports its lush foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding during its active growing season. Use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks, reflecting nutrient availability from decaying organic matter in its natural environment.
