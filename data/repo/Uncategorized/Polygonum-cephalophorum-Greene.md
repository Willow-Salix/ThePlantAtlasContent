## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Rocky Mountains region, including parts of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane and Subalpine Forest/Meadow (characterized by cool to cold temperatures, distinct seasons, and moderate to high precipitation, often as snow). |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial shade. In its natural habitat, it grows in open slopes, moist meadows, and forest edges, suggesting it thrives with good light exposure but can tolerate some afternoon shade, especially in warmer areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking its native habitat in moist meadows. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, but do not let the soil dry out completely between waterings. Moderate to frequent watering will be necessary, depending on temperature and light. |

## 🌱 Overview
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its montane and subalpine origins, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It has moderate fertility needs and is best suited for climates with distinct seasons, tolerating cool temperatures well.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilizer needs. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in spring, or a diluted liquid feed every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season, should be sufficient. Avoid over-fertilizing.
