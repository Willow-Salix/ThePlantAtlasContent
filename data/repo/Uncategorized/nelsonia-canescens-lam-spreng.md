## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical understory plant thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil and prefers partial to full shade, protected from direct harsh sunlight. Provide regular watering to maintain soil moisture and feed moderately during its growing season for optimal health, mimicking its humid, nutrient-cycling native environment.
