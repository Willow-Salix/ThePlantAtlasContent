## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawthorn thrives in temperate forest conditions, preferring full sun and well-drained soil. It requires moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions. Fertilization is generally light, supporting robust growth without excessive input.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can promote growth, but it's not a heavy feeder.
