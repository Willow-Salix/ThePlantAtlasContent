| **🌍 Origin** | Hispaniola (Dominican Republic, Haiti) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest / Subtropical Dry Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, adapting to bright indirect light conditions typical of a tropical understory or forest edge. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, well-draining soil; regular watering is essential, especially during dry periods, mimicking tropical rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chionanthus (), common name: fringetrees, is a genus of about 140 species of flowering plants in the family Oleaceae.

The genus has a wide distribution primarily in the tropics and subtropics, but with three species extending north into temperate regions, one (C. retusus) in eastern Asia and two (C. virginicus and C. henryae) in eastern North America. Most of the tropical species are evergreen, while the three temperate species are deciduous. Some botanists restrict Chionanthus to the deciduous, temperate species, treating the evergreen species in a separate genus Linociera, but apart from leaf persistence, there is no other consistent difference between them.
They are shrubs and small to medium-sized trees growing to 3–25 m tall. The leaves are opposite, simple. The flowers are produced in feathery panicles, with a corolla subdivided into four slender lobes; they are white, pale yellow, or tinged pink. The fruit is a drupe containing a single seed.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Dominican Fringetree, native to Hispaniola, thrives in warm tropical conditions with full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from regular watering and a balanced fertilizer during its growing season to mimic its natural humid, often nutrient-rich environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied during the active growing season, reflecting the nutrient cycling in tropical forest soils.
