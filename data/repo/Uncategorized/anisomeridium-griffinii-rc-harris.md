## 🌱 Overview
Anisomeridium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Monoblastiaceae. These lichens form thin, nearly invisible crusts that grow mostly embedded within the bark of trees or other surfaces. They are distinguished by their tiny flask-shaped fruiting bodies and distinctive spores that have internal cross-walls positioned closer to one end than the other.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As an epiphytic lichen native to humid subtropical forests, Anisomeridium griffinii requires consistently high humidity and low to medium indirect light. It does not need traditional watering or fertilization, relying on atmospheric moisture and nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; epiphytic lichens derive nutrients from the air and rain and are sensitive to chemical inputs.
