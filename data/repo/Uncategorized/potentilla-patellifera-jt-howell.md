| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane Coniferous Forest with Mediterranean influences |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; tolerant of intense sun at high elevations. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the growing season; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, especially during summer. |

## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full to partial sun within well-draining, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of montane pine forests. It requires moderate water during active growth but is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing very little to no supplemental fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, often serpentine soils and does not thrive with rich fertilization.
