## 🧤 Care Instructions
Common Yarrow is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It is very drought-tolerant once established and generally requires minimal fertilization. Avoid overwatering and rich soils to prevent leggy growth and promote robust flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in average to poor, well-draining soils and can become leggy with excessive nutrients, mimicking its adaptation to nutrient-sparse natural environments.
