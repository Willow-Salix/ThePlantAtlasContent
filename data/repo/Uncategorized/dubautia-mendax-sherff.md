## 🌱 Overview
Dubautia or na'ena'e is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. The genus was named after Joseph Eugène DuBaut (1796–1832), an officer in the French Navy who participated in Freycinet's expedition.
The entire genus is endemic to Hawaii. It contains more species than the other two genera in the silversword alliance, including cushion plants, shrubs, trees, and lianas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian hybrid thrives in bright light and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its montane habitat. Provide regular watering without waterlogging and apply a light, infrequent dose of fertilizer to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly, perhaps once or twice during the growing season, as native soils are often nutrient-poor.
