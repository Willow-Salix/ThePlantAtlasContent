| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, including Southern Europe (e.g., Italy, Greece) and North Africa |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring less water during dry summer periods, consistent with its adaptation to dry Mediterranean summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Helianthemum (), known as rock rose, sunrose, rushrose, or frostweed, is a genus of about 110 species of flowering plants in the family Cistaceae. They are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, especially in the Mediterranean.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Sun Rose thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its Mediterranean origins. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. Minimal fertilization is generally sufficient for healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor, well-drained soils; an annual light application of balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary.
