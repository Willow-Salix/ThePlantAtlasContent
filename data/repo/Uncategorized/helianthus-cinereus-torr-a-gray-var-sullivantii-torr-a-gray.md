## 🌱 Overview
Helianthus () is a genus comprising around 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the daisy family Asteraceae commonly known as sunflowers. Except for three South American species, the species of Helianthus are native to North America and Central America. The best-known species is the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus). This and other species, notably Jerusalem artichoke (H. tuberosus), are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions, as food crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants. The species H. annuus typically grows during the summer and into early fall, with the peak growth season being mid-summer.
Several perennial Helianthus species are grown in gardens, but have a tendency to spread rapidly and can become aggressive.  On the other hand, the whorled sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus, was listed as an endangered species in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule protecting it under the Endangered Species Act. The primary threats to this species are industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. They grow to 1.8 metres (6 feet) and are primarily found in woodlands, adjacent to creeks and moist, prairie-like areas.
The common sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine, cultivated there for several centuries.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sullivant's Sunflower, native to the temperate grasslands of the Central and Eastern United States, thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It is a low-maintenance plant, being quite drought-tolerant once established and requiring minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in average to poor soil and typically does not require significant fertilization. An annual application of compost or a light, balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil nutrients are very low.
