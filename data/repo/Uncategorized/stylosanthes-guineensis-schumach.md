## 🧤 Care Instructions
Guinea Stylo thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native tropical savanna environment. It needs regular watering during its active growth but is drought-tolerant once established. Minimal fertilization is generally required, though phosphorus can enhance its vigor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Supplementation with phosphorus and potassium can be beneficial, especially in nutrient-poor soils common in some savanna areas.
