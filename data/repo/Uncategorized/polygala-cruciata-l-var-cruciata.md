## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (Southeastern U.S. and parts of the Midwest, Ontario, Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate/Subtropical Wetlands and Open Pine Woodlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright direct to indirect light; tolerates full sun to partial shade, especially in open, moist areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil; requires frequent watering to prevent drying out, typical of bog and wetland plants, but good drainage is still important. |

## 🌱 Overview
A drumhead or drum skin is a membrane stretched over one or both of the open ends of a drum. The drumhead is struck with sticks, mallets, or hands, so that it vibrates and the sound resonates through the drum.
Additionally outside of percussion instruments, drumheads are also used on some string instruments, most notably the banjo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Drumheads thrive in consistently moist, acidic soil under bright light to partial shade conditions. Ensure frequent watering and good drainage, and provide only minimal fertilization, as they are adapted to naturally less nutrient-rich environments typical of their native wetlands and pinelands.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of a balanced, acid-loving fertilizer annually or biennially is sufficient, as they are adapted to naturally less fertile, acidic soils.
