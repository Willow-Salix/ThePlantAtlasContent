## 🌱 Overview
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, reflecting its origins in semi-arid grasslands. Provide infrequent, deep watering once established and apply minimal fertilizer to support its growth in lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced granular fertilizer once in spring is sufficient, as it is adapted to lean soils.
