## 🧤 Care Instructions
Velvet Tobacco thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, necessitating infrequent, deep watering. It prefers poor to lean soils and does not typically need fertilization, reflecting its adaptation to arid Australian conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers lean to poor soils; fertilizer is generally not required or should be applied very sparingly due to adaptation to low-nutrient environments.
