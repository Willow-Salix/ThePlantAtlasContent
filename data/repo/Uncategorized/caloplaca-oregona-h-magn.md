| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Oregon, Washington, British Columbia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Coniferous Forest (on exposed rocks and bark) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun (requiring high light exposure, typical of exposed rock faces or tree bark) |
| **💧 Water** | Relies on natural precipitation (rain, fog, dew) and ambient humidity for moisture. It needs periods of drying out between moisture events and does not require direct watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Caloplaca is a lichen genus comprising a number of distinct species. Members of the genus are commonly called firedot lichen, jewel lichen. gold lichens, "orange lichens", but they are not always orange, as in the case of C. albovariegata. The distribution of this lichen genus is worldwide, extending from Antarctica to the high Arctic. It includes a portion of northern North America and the Russian High Arctic. There are about thirty species of Caloplaca in the flora of the British Isles.
A new species of Caloplaca, C. obamae, the first species to be named in honor of Barack Obama, was discovered in 2007 on Santa Rosa Island in California and published in March 2009.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in high light conditions, mimicking its native habitat on exposed rocks or bark in temperate coniferous forests. It requires natural moisture from rain, fog, and humidity, along with crucial periods of desiccation. Avoid direct watering and all forms of conventional fertilization, as these are detrimental to its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens derive nutrients from the air and their substrate; traditional fertilizers are not only unnecessary but can be harmful.
