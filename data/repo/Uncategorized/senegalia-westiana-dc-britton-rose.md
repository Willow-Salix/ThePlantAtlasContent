## 🌱 Overview
Senegalia (from Senegal and Acacia senegal (L.) Willd.) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It belongs to the Mimosoid clade. Until 2005, its species were considered members of Acacia.
The genus was considered polyphyletic and required further division, with the genera Parasenegalia and Pseudosenegalia accepted soon after. 
Senegalia can be distinguished from other acacias by its spicate inflorescences and non-spinescent stipules.  
Plants in the genus are native to the tropical and subtropical areas of the world, occurring on the Australian, Asian, African and South and North American continents, as well as in Wallacea.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun, reflecting its native savanna environment. Water regularly during active growth, allowing soil to dry, and fertilize sparingly as it adapts to less fertile soils and fixes its own nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season, though it often thrives in average to poor soils due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.
