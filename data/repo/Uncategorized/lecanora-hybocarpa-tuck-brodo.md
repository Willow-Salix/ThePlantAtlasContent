| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America, Europe |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate and Boreal Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to dappled light. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High ambient humidity and consistent moisture are critical. Frequent misting or placement in a humid environment is necessary, allowing brief drying periods between wetting to prevent fungal issues. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Rim Lichen thrives in cool, humid conditions found in its native temperate and boreal forests. It requires partial to dappled light and high ambient moisture, best achieved through regular misting. No external fertilization is needed, as it is self-sufficient in nutrient acquisition.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens derive necessary nutrients from air, rain, and their substrate, and commercial fertilizers can be detrimental.
