## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires infrequent, deep watering, mimicking its native arid conditions. It has minimal fertilizer needs and prefers lean, well-draining soil to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal. An annual application of a very dilute, balanced fertilizer in spring or early summer is sufficient, or none at all if grown in appropriate lean desert soil.
