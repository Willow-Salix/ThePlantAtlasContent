## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |

| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (primarily California, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean and Arid Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure (full sun); accustomed to open, unshaded environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate; allow soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings, as it's adapted to dry summers and can tolerate drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Saltugilia is a genus of flowering plants in the phlox family, Polemoniaceae. They are known commonly as woodland gilias. There are four species. Two are endemic to California in the United States, and the distributions of the other two extend into Baja California in Mexico.
This genus was erected in the year 2000 to segregate three species from the genus Gilia on the basis of phylogenetic evidence. Analysis of DNA was used in the formation of the new taxon, and studies of other characteristics of the plants, such as morphological, palynological, and ecological traits, were considered.  Saltugilia was a section of genus Gilia. These three species were classified in the new genus Saltugilia, and the fourth was newly described to science in 2001.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Saltugilia thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean and arid shrubland habitat. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering, with soil allowed to dry completely between sessions. Fertilization should be kept low to mimic its natural, nutrient-poor growing conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically grows in nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils, so infrequent or no fertilization is generally needed.
