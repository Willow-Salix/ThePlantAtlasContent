## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate Eurasia, including Central Asia, Siberia, Mongolia, Northern China, and parts of Eastern Europe |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland (Steppe) and Subalpine Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is ideal, reflecting its open grassland and steppe habitat. Can tolerate some partial sun in very hot climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid waterlogging, as it prefers conditions mimicking arid to semi-arid rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Eurasian Junegrass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native temperate steppe and subalpine meadow environments. This hardy grass is highly drought-tolerant, needing minimal watering once established, and requires little to no fertilization. The key to its care is providing dry, open, and sunny conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced granular fertilizer in early spring can be applied if growth seems sluggish.
