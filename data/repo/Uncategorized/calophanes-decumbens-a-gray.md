# Calophanes decumbens A. Gray
### *Calophanes decumbens A. Gray*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mexico and parts of Central America (e.g., Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Tropical/Subtropical Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; thrives in bright, direct light conditions typical of open scrublands. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; allow soil to dry out completely between thorough waterings, especially during active growth. Reduce watering significantly during cooler or dormant periods. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant, native to arid tropical scrublands, requires bright light and is highly drought-tolerant, needing its soil to dry completely between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot and mimic its natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; apply a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season, as native soils are generally not rich.
