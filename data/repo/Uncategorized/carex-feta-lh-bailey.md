Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Greensheath Sedge thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native wetland environments. It is adaptable to full sun or partial shade conditions and has low to moderate nutrient requirements. Ensure the soil never dries out to promote healthy growth.
