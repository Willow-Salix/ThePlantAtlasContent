## 🧤 Care Instructions
Guamia thrives in conditions that mimic its native tropical rainforest, requiring high humidity, warm temperatures, and indirect light. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil and provide moderate fertilization during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, typically every 2-4 weeks. Reduce or cease fertilization during fall and winter months.
