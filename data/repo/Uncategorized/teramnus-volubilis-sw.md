## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical vine thrives in warm, humid environments with full sun to partial shade. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, allowing the top layer to dry slightly between waterings. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, fertilize sparingly with a balanced feed during its active growth phase.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen fertilization is generally not needed.
