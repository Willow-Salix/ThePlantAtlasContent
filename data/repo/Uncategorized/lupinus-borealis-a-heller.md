## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Boreal Lupine thrives in cool, sunny environments with well-drained soil, mimicking its montane origins. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and benefits from little to no supplemental fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and does not require supplemental nitrogen.
