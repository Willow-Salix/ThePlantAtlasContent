## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bailey's Ivesia thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soil, reflecting its native alpine habitat. Water moderately during its active growth period, ensuring the soil dries out between applications, and significantly reduce watering in winter. Fertilizer needs are minimal, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal. Adapted to lean, rocky soils; excessive fertilization can harm the plant. A very light, balanced application once per growing season, if at all, is sufficient.
