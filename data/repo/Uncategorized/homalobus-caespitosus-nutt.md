## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western and Central United States (e.g., Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, California, Nevada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie and Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open prairie and scrubland habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low; drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Mimic sporadic rainfall patterns of its native dry regions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Astragalus is a large genus of over 3,000 species of herbs and small shrubs, belonging to the legume family Fabaceae and the subfamily Faboideae. It is the largest genus of plants in terms of described species. The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Common names include milkvetch (most species), locoweed (in North America, some species) and goat's-thorn (A. gummifer, A. tragacantha). Some pale-flowered vetches (Vicia spp.) are similar in appearance, but they are more vine-like than Astragalus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient perennial thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soils. It requires minimal watering once established and generally needs no supplemental fertilizer due to its adaptation to arid prairie environments. Emulate its native dry, open conditions for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils and, as a legume, fixes its own nitrogen, making supplemental fertilization largely unnecessary.
