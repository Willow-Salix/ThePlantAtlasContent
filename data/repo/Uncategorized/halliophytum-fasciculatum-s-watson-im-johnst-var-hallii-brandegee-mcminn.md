## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern California, Southwestern United States |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. This plant thrives in open, unshaded locations, requiring direct sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily, consistent with its native exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering. Highly drought-tolerant once established, mimicking its native habitat's low rainfall and dry summers. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings; avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Tetracoccus is a plant genus under the family Picrodendraceae. Shrubby-spurge is a common name for plants in this genus. They are dioecious, often hairy shrubs.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hall's Phacelia is a resilient plant ideal for arid or low-water gardens, demanding full sun exposure. It requires infrequent watering, thriving on drought conditions once established, and has very low fertilizer needs. Its care strategy prioritizes mimicking its dry, sunny native environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, well-draining soils of chaparral and scrublands. Minimal or no fertilization is typically required, perhaps a very light, balanced application once a year if growth appears stunted.
