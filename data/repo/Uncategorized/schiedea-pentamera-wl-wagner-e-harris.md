## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Hairy Schiedea thrives in bright, sunny conditions and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Hawaiian montane dry shrubland habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing due to its adaptation to nutrient-scarce environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; native to nutrient-poor volcanic soils, so minimal fertilization is needed, if any, during the growing season.
