## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains, specifically Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico, Arizona) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat on open, high-altitude slopes and meadows with intense solar radiation. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Thrives in well-drained soil and tolerates drier conditions once established, mimicking its native habitat where moisture comes from snowmelt followed by periods of less rain. |

## 🌱 Overview
Oxytropis is a genus of plants in the legume family. It includes over 600 species native to subarctic to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. It is one of three genera of plants known as locoweeds, and are notorious for being toxic to grazing animals. The other locoweed genus is the closely related Astragalus. Most oxtropis species are native to Eurasia and North America, but several species are native to the Arctic. These are hairy perennial plants which produce raceme inflorescences of pink, purple, white, or yellow flowers which are generally pea-like but have distinctive sharply beaked keels. The stems are leafless, the leaves being all basal. The plant produces legume pods containing the seeds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soil, typical of its alpine and subalpine origins. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry out between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization. It prefers conditions that mimic high-altitude environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, and its native high-altitude soils are typically lean. Excessive fertilization can be harmful.
