## 🧤 Care Instructions
Eastern Silvery Aster thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires dry, well-drained, sandy soils, mirroring its native southeastern U.S. pine barren habitat. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization as it tolerates nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in poor, sandy soils and can be harmed by excessive nutrients. If desired, a very light, slow-release, balanced fertilizer can be applied in spring.
