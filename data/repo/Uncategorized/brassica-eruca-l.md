## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean region (Southern Europe, North Africa, Western Asia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Temperate Shrubland/Grassland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates to prevent bolting. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; prefers consistently moist, but not waterlogged, soil. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, mimicking natural rainfall patterns of mild, wet winters and dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rocket, eruca, or arugula (Eruca sativa) is an edible annual plant in the family Brassicaceae used as a leaf vegetable for its fresh, tart, bitter, and peppery flavour. Its other common names include salad rocket and garden rocket (in the UK, Australia, South Africa, Ireland, and New Zealand), as well as colewort, roquette, ruchetta, rucola, rucoli, and rugula. Native to the Mediterranean region, it is widely popular as a salad vegetable.
Some botanists consider it a subspecies of Eruca vesicaria. However, they are different in many morphological aspects, such as sepal persistence, silique shape, and habit. Most importantly, they do not hybridise freely with each other as there is partial reproductive isolation between them. The Plants of the World Online database has accepted Eruca sativa as a distinct species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Arugula thrives in conditions similar to its Mediterranean origins: full sun with some afternoon shade in intense heat, and consistently moist soil. Provide moderate nutrients to support its rapid leafy growth, and protect it from extreme heat to prolong its harvest.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding; benefits from fertile, well-draining soil. An all-purpose balanced fertilizer or a nitrogen-rich amendment can be applied every 2-4 weeks during active growth, especially in poorer soils.
