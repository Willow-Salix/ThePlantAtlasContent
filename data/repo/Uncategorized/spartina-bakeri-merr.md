## 🌱 Overview
Spartina is a genus of plants in the grass family, frequently found in coastal salt marshes. Species in this genus are commonly known as cordgrass or cord-grass, and are native to the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean in western and southern Europe, north-western and southern Africa, the Americas and the islands of the southern Atlantic Ocean; one or two species also occur on the western coast of North America and in freshwater habitats inland in the Americas. The highest species diversity is on the east coasts of North and South America, particularly Florida. They form large, often dense colonies, particularly on coastal salt marshes, and grow quickly. The species vary in size from 0.3–2 m tall. Many of the species will produce hybrids if they come into contact.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sand Cordgrass thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native coastal marsh and dune habitats. It is highly tolerant of brackish water and can withstand periods of inundation. While adaptable to various soil types, a moderate feeding schedule can promote robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; can thrive in nutrient-poor sandy soils but benefits from light, balanced fertilization, especially in very lean substrates.
