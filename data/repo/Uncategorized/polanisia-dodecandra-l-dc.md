## 🧤 Care Instructions
Redwhisker Clammyweed thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native prairie and open woodland environments. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and fertilize sparingly as it adapts well to less fertile conditions. It is a relatively low-maintenance plant once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, especially in poor soils. Its native disturbed and sandy soils suggest it does not require high nutrient levels.
