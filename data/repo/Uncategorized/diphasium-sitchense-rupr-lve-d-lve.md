## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America (primarily Pacific Northwest, Alaska, and eastern Canada), Greenland, Iceland, northern Europe, and parts of Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Coniferous Forest, Subalpine/Boreal Forest, and Tundra margins |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade, mimicking its native forest understory habitat. Avoid direct, harsh sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Good drainage is essential to prevent root rot, reflecting its preference for damp, well-draining forest floors. |

## 🌱 Overview
Diphasium is a genus of lycophytes in the family Lycopodiaceae. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), it is placed in the subfamily Lycopodioideae. Some sources do not recognize the genus, sinking it into Lycopodium, others include it in Diphasiastrum. Diphasium species are mostly native to the temperate southern hemisphere, but extend northwards into Central America and the Caribbean.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sitka Clubmoss thrives in cool, humid environments with partial to full shade, mimicking its native forest understory. Ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained, as it dislikes both drought and waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, if any, as it is not a heavy feeder.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Clubmosses generally do not require heavy feeding, thriving in nutrient-poor to moderately rich forest soils. A very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly, if at all.
