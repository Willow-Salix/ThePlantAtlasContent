## 🌱 Overview
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil, mimicking its native dry slopes. Water regularly during its spring growth period, then significantly reduce watering as it enters summer dormancy. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring will suffice if the soil is not already rich.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers moderately fertile to lean, well-draining soil; a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring is generally sufficient, avoiding excessive nitrogen.
