## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, western Texas) and northern Mexico, predominantly along stream banks, canyons, and in wet areas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Riparian (within arid and semi-arid regions), often found in montane or foothill environments. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it often grows along exposed stream banks or at the edges of woodlands where it receives ample light. |
| **💧 Water** | High. Thrives in consistently moist to wet soils, mimicking its native riparian habitat along perennial streams and springs. It should not be allowed to dry out completely, especially during warm periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Alnus oblongifolia (Arizona alder) is a large alder growing up to 72 feet (22 m), from the southwestern United States and northern Sonora, Mexico. It grows across Arizona into western New Mexico mountain ranges. In central Arizona its range extends across the transition zone to the White Mountains region of eastern Arizona–western New Mexico border.
Besides the range extension from central Arizona, elsewhere in New Mexico it occurs only in scattered mountain range locales. In southern Arizona south of the Mogollon Rim, also in two mountain regions, and in neighboring Sonora in regions at the north of the Sierra Madre Occidental cordillera near Arizona's southeast Madrean Sky Island ranges of sky islands. Isolated mountain locales also occur in a region of southwest Chihuahua and neighboring northwest Durango, part of the eastern Sierra Madre Occidentals.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Arizona Alder thrives in consistently moist to wet soil conditions and prefers full sun to partial shade, reflecting its native riparian habitat. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Ensure adequate water, especially in hot climates, for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As an alder, it forms a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules, allowing it to enrich the soil with nitrogen. Supplemental fertilization is generally not heavily required, but a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in very poor soils.
