## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Northern California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it typically grows in open fields and roadsides. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires regular watering during germination and initial growth; thereafter, water infrequently, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings, especially during hot, dry summers. Well-draining soil is crucial to prevent rot during wet winters. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Whitewhorl Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean climate. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering during dry spells. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally needs little to no supplemental fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil and thrives in poor to moderately fertile conditions. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
