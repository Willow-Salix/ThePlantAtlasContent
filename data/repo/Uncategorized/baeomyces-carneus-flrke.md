| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across cool temperate and boreal regions of Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate and Boreal Heathlands and Open Woodlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial Sun to Moderate Indirect Light. Thrives in open situations or clearings, often tolerating some direct morning sun but preferring protection from intense afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent high humidity and frequent moisture, mimicking regular rainfall and dew. The substrate should be kept consistently damp but well-drained; avoid prolonged dry periods or waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Baeomyces is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Baeomycetaceae. Members of Baeomyces are commonly called beret lichens. These lichens are radily recognised by their distinctive "matchstick" appearance, with small brown fruiting bodies held up on short stalks above a crusty base. They typically grow in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, bare soil, and mining sites, where they act as pioneer colonisers of acidic ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Cap Lichen, replicate its cool temperate to boreal habitat with consistent high humidity and moderate, indirect light. Maintain a consistently damp, acidic, and nutrient-poor substrate, ensuring good air circulation. Avoid any external fertilization, as it can harm the organism.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed. Lichens are highly sensitive to excess nutrients, deriving all necessary elements from air and precipitation. Artificially enriched environments can be detrimental.
