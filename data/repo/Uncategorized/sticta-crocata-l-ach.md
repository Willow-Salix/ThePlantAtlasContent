## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest), Europe (e.g., Atlantic coastlines), and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate Forests / Temperate Rainforests |
| **☀️ Light** | Low light to partial shade, avoiding direct sunlight. Prefers areas sheltered by tree canopies or in deep shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires very high atmospheric humidity (70-90%+) and consistent moisture from rain, mist, or dew. Highly sensitive to desiccation and cannot tolerate dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sticta is a genus of lichens in the family Peltigeraceae. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in tropical areas, and includes about 114 species. These lichens have a leafy appearance, and are colored brown or black. Sticta species with cyanobacteria as photobionts can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, and due to their relative abundance and high turnover, they contribute appreciably to the rainforest ecosystem. They are commonly called spotted felt lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sticta crocata is a lichen that thrives in highly humid, cool, and shaded environments, typical of temperate rainforests or oceanic climates. It requires consistent moisture from the air or frequent misting, avoiding any direct sun or dry conditions. Traditional plant fertilizers are harmful, as it obtains all nutrients from the atmosphere and substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizers are needed or recommended. Lichens derive all necessary nutrients from airborne particles, precipitation, and the substrate. They are sensitive to pollutants and nutrient excess.
