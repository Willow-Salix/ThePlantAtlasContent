## 🌱 Overview
Rhamphospermum arvense, (syns. Brassica arvensis and Sinapis arvensis) the charlock, sometimes also called field mustard, wild mustard, or charlock mustard, is an annual or winter annual plant in the family Brassicaceae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Charlock is a hardy annual that prefers full sun and moderate watering. It is highly adaptable to various soil types and typically requires minimal fertilization, reflecting its nature as a resilient field weed. Ensure good drainage and adequate sunlight for best results.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average garden soil and doesn't typically require heavy fertilization, but benefits from general-purpose nutrients in poorer soils.
