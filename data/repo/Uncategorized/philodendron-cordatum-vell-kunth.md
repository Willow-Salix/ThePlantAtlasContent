| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern Brazil (Atlantic Forest biome) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can scorch leaves, as it naturally grows in the understory or as a climbing epiphyte. |

## 🌱 Overview
Philodendron is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. As of September 2025, the Plants of the World Online accepted 625 species; other sources accept different numbers. Regardless of number of species, the genus is the second-largest member of the family Araceae, after genus Anthurium. Taxonomically, the genus Philodendron is still poorly known, with many undescribed species. Many are grown as ornamental and indoor plants. The name derives from the Greek words philo- 'love, affection' and dendron 'tree'. The generic name, Philodendron, is often used as the English name.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and high humidity, mimicking its tropical rainforest home. Keep the soil consistently moist but allow the top layer to dry out slightly between waterings, and feed lightly during the growing season to support its vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength, once a month. Tropical soils are often nutrient-poor for epiphytes.
