## 🧤 Care Instructions
Six-weeks Grama is a resilient grass thriving in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its arid native range. It requires infrequent watering, tolerating significant dry periods, and has very low fertilizer needs. This plant is ideal for xeric landscapes or areas with minimal supplemental irrigation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; native soils are often lean. A very light, balanced fertilizer might be applied once a year if growth appears stunted, but it generally thrives without supplemental feeding.
