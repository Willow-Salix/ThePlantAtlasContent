| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Bolivia, Peru, and other parts of subtropical South America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Montane Valleys and Dry Tropical Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6-8+ hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and fruit production, reflecting their open habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular and consistent watering, especially during flowering and fruiting. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot, mimicking their native wet and drier seasonal patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Capsicum () is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family Solanaceae, native to the Americas, cultivated worldwide for their edible fruit, which are generally known as "peppers" or "capsicum".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide Aji Peppers with abundant direct sunlight and consistently moist, well-draining soil, allowing slight drying between waterings. Fertilize regularly during the growing season with a balanced plant food, transitioning to a high-potassium formula for robust fruiting.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to heavy feeders. Thrive in nutrient-rich, well-draining soil. Fertilize every 2-4 weeks with a balanced fertilizer, switching to a high-potassium formula once fruits begin to set.
