## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Subarctic regions, including Greenland, Northern Canada, Alaska, Scandinavia, and Siberia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in open, exposed conditions common in its native habitat, accustomed to long daylight hours during the growing season. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil, especially during its short growing season, replicating conditions from melting snow and ice. Good drainage is crucial to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arctic native requires cool temperatures, full to partial sun exposure, and consistently moist yet well-drained soil. It is adapted to low nutrient levels, therefore requiring minimal to no fertilization, making it ideal for rock gardens or alpine settings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, or peaty soils of tundra environments. Fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
