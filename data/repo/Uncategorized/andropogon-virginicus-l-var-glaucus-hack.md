## 🧤 Care Instructions
This warm-season grass is exceptionally low-maintenance, thriving in full sun and poor soils. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and no significant fertilization. Mimicking its native open, dry habitats is key to its successful cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; thrives in poor, infertile soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental, so apply very sparingly if at all.
