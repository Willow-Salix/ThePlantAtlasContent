## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted shrub requires full sun and excellent drainage, thriving with minimal intervention once established. It is highly drought-tolerant, reflecting its arid native climate, and generally does not need fertilization. Plant in well-draining soil and water deeply but infrequently.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally not required. Thrives in lean soils; if growth is very poor, a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be used sparingly.
