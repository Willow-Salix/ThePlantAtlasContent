## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ginoria thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical moist forest. Provide bright indirect light, keep the soil consistently moist but well-drained, and fertilize moderately during the active growing period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced liquid fertilizer applied every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer) would mimic the nutrient cycling in its native environment.
