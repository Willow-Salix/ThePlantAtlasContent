## 🧤 Care Instructions
This crustose lichen thrives in cool, highly humid environments with low to moderate indirect light. It requires consistent moisture from the air and protection from direct sun and drought. Traditional fertilization should be avoided as it can be detrimental to its delicate symbiotic nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization is required. Lichens absorb nutrients directly from the atmosphere and their substrate. Artificial fertilizers can be harmful.
