## 🌱 Overview
Androsace, commonly known as rock jasmine, is a genus of flowering plants in the  family Primulaceae, second only to Primula in the number of species. It is predominantly Arctic–alpine, with many species in the Himalayas (where the genus originated), the mountains of central Asia, the Caucasus, and the southern and central European mountain systems, particularly the Alps and the Pyrenees.
Plants of this genus are sometimes known as rock jasmines or fairy candelabras, and are widely cultivated for their dense cushions covered in white or pink flowers. There are roughly 110 species.
These plants have small entire or toothed leaves which form a basal rosette.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide a location with full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained during its active growth period. This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its temperate to subalpine origins, preferring average soil fertility over rich, heavily fed environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average, well-draining soil without excessive nutrients, similar to its natural meadow habitat.
