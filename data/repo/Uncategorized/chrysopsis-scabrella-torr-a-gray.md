## 🌱 Overview
Chrysopsis (golden asters) are plants in the family Asteraceae native to the southern and eastern United States. All the species are found in Florida, although some are found in other states as well.
These are annual and perennial herbs bearing daisy-like flower heads with yellow disc florets and usually yellow ray florets. Some species formerly classified in this genus are now included in other genera: Heterotheca, Pityopsis, Stenotus, Ionactis, Aster, Eucephalus, Erigeron, Machaeranthera, Croptilon, Xanthisma, Oclemena, Bradburia, Oxypappus, Arnica, and Helichrysopsis.
Golden asters are often used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Schinia petulans (which feeds exclusively on C. subulata).

This resilient plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained sandy soils, mirroring its native coastal plain habitat. It requires moderate watering during establishment but is highly drought-tolerant once mature, needing minimal to no fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to lean to moderately fertile, sandy soils typical of its native environment. Excessive fertilization is not recommended.
