## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bitterbrush requires full sun exposure and extremely well-draining soil, thriving in conditions where other plants might struggle. Once established, it is remarkably drought-tolerant, needing minimal supplemental water and no regular fertilization. Overwatering is the most common cause of failure for this resilient plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; it thrives in poor, rocky, or sandy soils and is not a heavy feeder.
