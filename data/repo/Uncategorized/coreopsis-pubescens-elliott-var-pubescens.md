## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern and south-central United States |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grasslands and Open Woodlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open fields, prairies, and woodland clearings. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Its adaptation to dry, open areas suggests drought tolerance once established, requiring less frequent watering than many garden plants. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Star Tickseed thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native open habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, as it tolerates dry conditions once established. Fertilize sparingly in spring to avoid leggy growth and promote abundant flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native to prairies and open woodlands, it thrives in average to poor soils. A light, balanced fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if the soil is reasonably fertile, as over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth.
