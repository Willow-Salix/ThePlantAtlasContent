## 🧤 Care Instructions
This submerged aquatic plant thrives in temperate freshwater bodies with moderate to bright light. Ensure constant submergence in clear water and provide moderate nutrients without over-fertilizing to prevent algae.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate nutrient levels in the water column and substrate; excessive fertilization can lead to algal growth.
