## 🧤 Care Instructions
Native to the temperate deciduous forests of Eastern and Central North America, the Hybrid Hickory thrives in full sun and rich, well-draining soils. It requires moderate, consistent watering, especially when young, and benefits from organic matter to meet its nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate nutrient needs. A balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied, especially for young or struggling trees. Established trees benefit from organic matter (e.g., compost) in the soil.
