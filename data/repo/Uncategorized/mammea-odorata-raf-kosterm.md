## 🌱 Overview
Mammea is a flowering plant genus with about 70 species in the family Calophyllaceae. Its members are evergreen trees having edible fruits. The plants are dioecious, i.e. each individual plant produces either male or female flowers only. The calyx is fully fused initially, splitting into two or three valvate sepals. There are four to eight petals. Berries are formed, containing one to four seeds. The leaves are rigid, coriaceous and often have pellucid dots.
