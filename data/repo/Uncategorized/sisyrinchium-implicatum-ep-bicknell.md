## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Forests and Grasslands/Savannas |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Shade, especially appreciative of full sun in cooler parts of its range or partial shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is adapted to areas with regular rainfall but can tolerate brief dry periods once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sisyrinchium is a large genus of annual to perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. Native to the New World, the species are known as blue-eyed grasses. Although they are not true grasses (Poaceae), they are monocots.
Several species in the eastern United States are threatened or endangered. This may be due to niche species emerging from their unique tendency toward rapid speciation which helps them adapt to specialized arenic (sandy) habitats.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Blue-Eyed Grass thrives in the full sun to partial shade of its native southeastern U.S. pinelands and savannas. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from regular watering, especially during dry periods, while needing minimal fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is needed. If desired, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or amending the soil with compost, is sufficient.
