## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Manchurian Catalpa, adapted to temperate climates, requires full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Water regularly, especially when young, and fertilize sparingly in spring if soil nutrients are lacking. This hardy tree tolerates urban conditions and some drought once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in fertile, well-drained soils. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, particularly if soil is poor, reflecting the natural nutrient cycling in its native temperate forest environment.
