## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Santa Lucia Mountains, coastal California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Montane Coniferous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for best growth but tolerates some afternoon shade, particularly in hotter regions or when young. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during dry periods. While native to a dry-summer climate, it grows in canyons where moisture is more abundant; avoid prolonged drought. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Bristlecone Fir thrives in full sun to partial shade within a Mediterranean-type climate, preferring cool, moist winters and dry summers. Provide consistent moisture, especially during dry periods, ensuring well-draining soil, and offer light annual fertilization to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, or an annual top-dressing of compost, is usually sufficient.
