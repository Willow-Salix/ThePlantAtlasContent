## 🧤 Care Instructions
Desert Rue is an extremely hardy plant adapted to arid environments, demanding full sun and very little water. It thrives in poor, well-draining soil and should rarely be fertilized. Mimic its desert origins for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Native desert soils are typically nutrient-poor, so supplemental feeding should be rare and very light, if at all.
