## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Florida) and parts of northeastern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Open Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open, exposed areas, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerant of short dry spells once established, but prefers consistent moisture during active growth. |

## 🌱 Overview
Nuttallanthus is a genus of four species of herbaceous annuals and perennials that was traditionally placed in the foxglove family Scrophulariaceae. Due to new genetic research, it has now been placed in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. Three species of Nuttallanthus are native to North America and one to South America.  Nuttallanthus was until the 1980s included in a wider circumscription of the genus Linaria, a genus now considered restricted to the Old World.
The members of this genus are known in English as toadflax, a name shared with several other related genera. The scientific name honors Thomas Nuttall.
The North American species do not appear to form interspecific hybrids at all. The most common mode of reproduction is self-fertilization, with occasional fertilization by another plant of the same species.
Closely related genera include the Linaria (Eurasian toadflaxes), Antirrhinum (snapdragons) and Cymbalaria (ivy-leaved toadflaxes).
Linaria floridanus / Nuttalanthus floridana, common name Apalachicola toadflax or Florida toadflax, is a species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Texas toadflax thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers average to lean soils. It requires moderate watering, tolerating some drought once established, and benefits from well-draining conditions. Avoid excessive fertilization to promote a more compact and floriferous plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to average to lean soils; excessive fertilization is generally not needed and can lead to leggy growth. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if the soil is poor.
