## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cypress thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil, despite its native tolerance for poor drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and should be fertilized minimally, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. This plant is adapted to extremely nutrient-poor, acidic soils and does not require rich amendments.
