## 🌱 Overview
Erythronium, the fawn lily, trout lily, dog's-tooth violet or adder's tongue, is a genus of Eurasian and North American plants in the lily family, most closely related to tulips. The name Erythronium derives from Ancient Greek ἐρυθρός (eruthrós) "red" in Greek, referring to the red flowers of E. dens-canis. Of all the established species, most live in North America; only six species are found in Europe and Asia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This ephemeral spring bloomer requires partial shade to dappled sun and consistently moist, humus-rich soil during its active period in late winter and early spring. It becomes dormant as summer arrives, needing dry conditions and full shade to thrive until the next growing season.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Rich, well-draining soil high in organic matter. Light feeding with a balanced organic fertilizer in early spring is sufficient.
