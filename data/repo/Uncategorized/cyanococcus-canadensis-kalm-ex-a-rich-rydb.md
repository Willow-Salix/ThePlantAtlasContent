## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Canada (from Newfoundland to British Columbia) and the northern United States (south to West Virginia and Minnesota) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Boreal Forest, Bog, and Wetland environments |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for optimal fruit production. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist, well-drained, acidic soil. Mimics its native bog and woodland habitats, avoid drying out completely but do not allow to become waterlogged. |

## 🌱 Overview
Blueberries are a widely distributed and widespread group of perennial flowering plants with blue or purple berries. They are classified in the section Cyanococcus within the genus Vaccinium. Commercial blueberries—both wild (lowbush) and cultivated (highbush)—are all native to North America. The highbush varieties were introduced into Europe during the 1930s.
Blueberries are usually prostrate shrubs that can vary in size from 10 centimeters (4 inches) to 4 meters (13 feet) in height. In the commercial production of blueberries, the species with small, pea-size berries growing on low-level bushes is known as "lowbush blueberries" (synonymous with "wild"), while the species with larger berries growing on taller, cultivated bushes is known as "highbush blueberries". Canada is the leading producer of lowbush blueberries, while the United States produces some 29% of the world's supply of highbush blueberries.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This North American native thrives in cool, temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained acidic soil. Ensure steady moisture, especially during the growing season, and use a light, acid-specific fertilizer only as needed to mimic its natural boggy or woodland habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with an acid-forming fertilizer specifically formulated for blueberries; avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. May not require much if planted in naturally rich, acidic soil.
