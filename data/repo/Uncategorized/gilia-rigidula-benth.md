## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Oklahoma) and northern Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland, Semi-Arid Grassland, Desert margins |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun exposure (at least 6-8 hours daily). Thrives in bright, direct light conditions typical of open plains and desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Highly drought-tolerant; water sparingly and infrequently. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic natural arid rainfall patterns. Overwatering can be detrimental. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stiffleaf Gilia is a resilient plant that thrives in dry, sunny environments. Provide full sun exposure and water very sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. It prefers well-draining, nutrient-poor soil and requires minimal fertilization, reflecting its arid native habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. This plant is adapted to poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils and does not require rich nutrient levels. A light, balanced fertilizer once in spring, if at all, is sufficient.
