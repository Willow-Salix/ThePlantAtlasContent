## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native thrives in full sun within a Mediterranean climate, requiring well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant once established, needing moderate water during its growing season and very little during dry summers. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, fertilizer requirements are minimal, with a preference for low-nitrogen formulations if any are used.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. A light, balanced fertilizer or compost can be applied sparingly if soil is very poor.
