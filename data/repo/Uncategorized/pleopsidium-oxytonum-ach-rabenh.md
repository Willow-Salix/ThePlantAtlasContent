## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in temperate to arctic regions across North America, Europe, and Asia, particularly in mountainous areas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra to Temperate Montane, characterized by exposed, rocky environments. |
| **☀️ Light** | High to full sun exposure, as it thrives on open, unshaded rock surfaces. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies entirely on atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, snowmelt); tolerates prolonged dry periods and rehydrates when moisture is available. Does not require conventional watering. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This saxicolous lichen thrives in harsh, exposed conditions typical of its native alpine or montane rocky habitats. It requires high light and experiences cycles of wetting and drying, absorbing moisture directly from the atmosphere. It does not require conventional watering or fertilization, obtaining nutrients from airborne dust and its substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None required; obtains trace nutrients from airborne dust and the substrate.
