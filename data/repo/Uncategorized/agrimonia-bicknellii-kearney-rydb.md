## 🌱 Overview
Agrimonia (from the Greek ἀργεμώνη), commonly known as agrimony, is a genus of 12–15 species of perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the family Rosaceae, native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with one species also in Africa. The species grow to between 0.5–2 m (1.6–6.6 ft) tall, with interrupted pinnate leaves, and tiny yellow flowers borne on a single (usually unbranched) spike.
Agrimonia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including grizzled skipper (recorded on A. eupatoria) and large grizzled skipper.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate woodland plant thrives in partial to full sun with moderate, consistent moisture. It requires minimal fertilization and adapts well to average soil conditions. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, mimicking its native habitat in open woods and clearings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not a heavy feeder, can benefit from a light application of balanced fertilizer once a year in spring if soil is poor.
