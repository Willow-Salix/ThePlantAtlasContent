## 🌱 Overview
Eugenia is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family Myrtaceae. It has a worldwide, although highly uneven, distribution in tropical and subtropical regions. The bulk of the approximately 1,100 species occur in the New World tropics, especially in the eastern Brazil's northern Andes, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Forest (coastal forests). Other centers of diversity include New Caledonia and Madagascar. Many species in the Old World have received a new classification into the genus Syzygium.
All species are woody evergreen trees and shrubs. Several are grown as ornamental plants for their attractive glossy foliage, and a few produce edible fruit that are eaten fresh or used in jams and jellies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Padron's Stopper thrives in conditions mimicking its native Cuban tropical moist forest habitat, preferring bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide moderate fertilization during active growth to support its development. Avoid waterlogging to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer. Reduce or withhold during dormancy.
