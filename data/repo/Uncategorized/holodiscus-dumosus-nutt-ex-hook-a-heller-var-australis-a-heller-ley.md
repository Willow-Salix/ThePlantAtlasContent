## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient shrub thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native semi-arid montane habitat. Water sparingly once established, allowing for dry periods between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization to prevent leggy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; native to lean, rocky soils. Requires minimal to no fertilization; a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring if growth is poor.
