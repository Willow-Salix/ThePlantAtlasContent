## 🌱 Overview
Heliconia is a genus of flowering plants in the monotypic family Heliconiaceae. Most of the 194 known species are native to the tropical Americas, but a few are indigenous to certain islands of the western Pacific and Maluku in Indonesia. Many species of Heliconia are found in the tropical forests of these regions. Most species are listed as either vulnerable or data deficient by the IUCN Red List of threatened species. Several species are widely cultivated as ornamentals, and a few are naturalized in Florida, Gambia, and Thailand.
Common names for the genus include lobster-claws, toucan beak, wild plantain, or false bird-of-paradise; the last term refers to their close similarity to the bird-of-paradise flowers in the genus Strelitzia. Collectively, these plants are also simply referred to as "heliconias".
Heliconia originated in the Late Eocene (39 Ma) and are the oldest known clade of hummingbird-pollinated plants.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a plant native to tropical rainforests, Heliconia deflexa thrives in consistently moist, well-drained soil and high humidity. It requires bright, indirect light, sheltered from harsh direct sun. Regular fertilization during its active growth period will support its vigorous development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to High. Fertilize regularly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength, every 2-4 weeks.
