| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring direct and intense sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely infrequent; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during the dormant winter months. Highly susceptible to rot from overwatering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Echinocactus is a genus of cacti in the subfamily Cactoideae. The generic name derives from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echînos), meaning "spiny," and cactus.  It and Ferocactus are the two genera of barrel cactus.  Members of the genus usually have heavy spination and relatively small flowers.  The fruits are copiously woolly, and this is one major distinction between Echinocactus and Ferocactus.  Propagation is by seed.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mimic its arid desert origin by providing abundant full sun and ensuring extremely infrequent watering to prevent root rot. Use a very well-draining soil mix and allow it to dry out entirely between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, if any, to reflect its nutrient-poor native environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; a dilute, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer), or none at all if regularly repotted.
