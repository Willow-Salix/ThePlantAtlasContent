## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Florida Bully is a hardy subtropical plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native scrubland habitat. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering only during prolonged dry spells. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer may be beneficial, but avoid over-fertilization.
