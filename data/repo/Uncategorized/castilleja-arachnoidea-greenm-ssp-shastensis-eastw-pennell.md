## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern California, USA (specifically around Mount Shasta and the southern Cascade Range) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane/Subalpine, characterized by rocky slopes, open forests, cold snowy winters, and relatively dry summers. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), typical of its open, high-altitude native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth (spring to early summer), ensuring excellent drainage; tolerant of drier conditions once established, especially during the summer months. Avoid waterlogging at all costs. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Shasta Indian Paintbrush thrives in full sun and extremely well-draining, lean soil, mimicking its native montane habitat. It requires moderate water during its growing season but tolerates drought once established, making drainage paramount. Fertilization should be avoided or kept to an absolute minimum.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant is adapted to lean, often rocky and infertile soils, and excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
