## 🧤 Care Instructions
Oettinger's Trillium requires a shaded location reminiscent of its native redwood forest understory, with consistently moist, well-drained, and organically rich soil. Mimicking its cool, humid native climate will ensure successful growth, avoiding harsh direct sun and prolonged drought.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers rich, organic soil. Amend with compost annually; a light application of a balanced slow-release organic fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial.
