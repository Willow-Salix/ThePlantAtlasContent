# No widely recognized common name
### *Cornucopiae hyemalis Walter*

![No widely recognized common name](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Alopecurus_myosuroides1.jpg)

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (specifically regions covered by Thomas Walter's 'Flora Caroliniana', primarily South Carolina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in open fields, woodlands, and disturbed areas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. As a native grass from open areas, it requires ample light, ideally 6+ hours of direct sun per day. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate. Prefers consistently moist soil but can tolerate short periods of drought once established, reflecting the seasonal rainfall patterns of its native habitat. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Alopecurus, or foxtail grass, is a common and widespread genus of plants in the grass family. It is common across temperate and subtropical parts of Eurasia, northern Africa, and the Americas, as well as naturalized in Australia and on various islands.
Foxtails can be annual or perennial. They grow in tufts. They have flat leaves and blunt ligules (a small flap at the junction of leaf and stem). Their inflorescence is a dense panicle (a branching head without terminal flower) with 1-flowered spikelets. A few, particularly A. myosuroides, are considered weeds, others are very decorative and are used in bouquets of dried flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This obscure native grass from the Southeastern U.S. is adapted to humid subtropical conditions. Provide it with full to partial sun exposure and maintain moderately moist soil. It is a low-maintenance plant requiring minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in average soil fertility without heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, if needed for poor soil, would be sufficient.
