## 🌱 Overview
Digitaria is a genus of plants in the grass family native to tropical and warm temperate regions but can occur in tropical, subtropical, and cooler temperate regions as well. Common names include crabgrass, finger-grass, and fonio. They are slender monocotyledonous annual and perennial lawn, pasture, and forage plants; some are often considered lawn pests. Digitus is the Latin word for "finger", and they are distinguished by the long, finger-like inflorescences they produce.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This subtropical grass thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils characteristic of its native Florida and Caribbean pine flatwoods. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and generally needs little to no supplemental fertilization due to its adaptation to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils typical of its native habitat.
