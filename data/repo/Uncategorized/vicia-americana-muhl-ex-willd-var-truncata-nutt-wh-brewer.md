## 🧤 Care Instructions
This vetch prefers sunny to partly shaded locations and well-draining soil. Water moderately, ensuring the soil dries out slightly between applications, as it is adapted to temperate climates with varying moisture. Minimal to no fertilization is required due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is needed, as Vicia americana is a nitrogen-fixing legume that enriches the soil with its own nitrogen.
