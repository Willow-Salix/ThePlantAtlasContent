## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal, including mountainous regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane Temperate to Subarctic (Alpine/Subalpine Rock Outcrops) |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light. Mimic its native habitat by avoiding direct, intense sunlight which can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture. Keep the growing medium (rock or substrate) damp but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Regular misting is highly beneficial to maintain high ambient humidity. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hymenostylium scabrum thrives in cool, humid conditions with indirect light, replicating its natural montane rock habitat. Maintain consistent moisture for its substrate and high ambient humidity through frequent misting, while ensuring excellent drainage. Fertilization needs are minimal to none for this calcicolous moss.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Mosses are not heavy feeders and can thrive with the natural minerals in water or substrate. If used, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly once or twice a year is sufficient.
