## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Rocky Mountain and Great Basin regions (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Utah). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane Shrubland/Grassland and Open Coniferous Forest, characterized by dry summers and cold, snowy winters. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open areas, meadows, and forest clearings. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic natural dry periods and prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Silvery Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, showing strong drought tolerance once established. It requires minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities, preferring leaner soil conditions. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root issues, especially in its native arid-adapted environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers, which can inhibit flowering; if necessary, a very light application of a phosphorus-potassium dominant formula.
