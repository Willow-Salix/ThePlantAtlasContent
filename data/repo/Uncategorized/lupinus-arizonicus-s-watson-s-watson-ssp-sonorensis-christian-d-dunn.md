| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to very low; highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sonora lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Sonoran Desert habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it generally needs little to no fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a low-nitrogen or balanced formula only if soil is exceptionally poor.
