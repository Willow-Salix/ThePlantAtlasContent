## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Puerto Rico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Wetland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, requiring high light exposure typical of open wetland environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently wet to saturated soil, mimicking its native boggy and marshy habitats; can tolerate shallow standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical wetland sedge thrives in consistently saturated soil, ideally with some standing water, and requires full to partial sun. Provide moderate fertilizer during active growth to support its nutrient needs in a wetland-like environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced aquatic or general-purpose fertilizer during the growing season, reflecting the organic richness of wetland soils.
