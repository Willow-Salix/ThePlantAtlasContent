## 🧤 Care Instructions
This annual herb thrives in full sun, requiring consistent moisture during its active growth in winter and spring. As it matures, it adapts to drier conditions, naturally completing its lifecycle before summer's heat. Minimal fertilization is typically needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced fertilizer may be applied once during the growing season, but often not strictly necessary for this annual herb in suitable soil.
