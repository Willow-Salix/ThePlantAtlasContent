| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in open, sunny locations or the edges of woodlands where it receives ample light. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, consistent moisture during the active growing season (spring to early summer), but it requires well-drained soil to prevent rot, especially during dormant periods or prolonged wet spells. Tolerant of drier conditions once established. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Wood Lily thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained, organically rich soil, mimicking its prairie and open woodland origins. It requires moderate, consistent moisture during its growing season but dislikes soggy conditions, particularly in winter. Provide low to moderate fertilization to support its robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from naturally rich, organic soils typical of prairies. An annual application of compost or a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial in less fertile soils.
