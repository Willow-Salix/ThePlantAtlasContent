## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, particularly montane and subalpine regions of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges (e.g., Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, California, Oregon, Washington, northward into British Columbia and Alaska). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. As it grows in open meadows, it requires substantial light exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil. Native to wet meadows and stream banks, it demands regular and ample watering, ensuring the soil never dries out completely but also drains well. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arnica  is a genus of perennial, herbaceous plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). The genus name Arnica may be derived from the Greek arni, "lamb", in reference to the plants' soft, hairy leaves. Arnica is also known by the names mountain tobacco and, confusingly, leopard's bane and wolfsbane—two names that it shares with the entirely unrelated genus Aconitum.
This circumboreal and montane (subalpine) genus occurs mostly in the temperate regions of western North America, with a few species native to the Arctic regions of northern Eurasia and North America.
Arnica species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Bucculatrix arnicella.
Arnica was previously classified in the tribe Senecioneae because it has a flower or pappus of fine bristles.
Arnica is the basis of a homeopathic remedy promoted for aiding bruise recovery.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in cool, moist conditions characteristic of its native montane meadows. Provide full to partial sun and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its natural habitat near stream banks. It prefers moderately fertile soil, with minimal need for heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Benefits from average to moderately rich garden soil; a light application of balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient if soil is poor.
