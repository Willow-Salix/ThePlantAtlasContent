## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires infrequent watering, typical of its arid scrubland origins. Provide well-draining soil and fertilize sparingly during the growing season to ensure optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted, balanced cactus fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer) to reflect nutrient-poor native soils.
