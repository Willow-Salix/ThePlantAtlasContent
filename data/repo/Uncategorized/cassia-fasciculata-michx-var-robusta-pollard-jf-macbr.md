## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and Central United States, parts of Canada (North America) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie and Open Woodlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open field and prairie habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; allow the soil surface to dry between waterings. Established plants are tolerant of some drought but prefer consistent moisture during their active growing season. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chamaecrista fasciculata, the partridge pea, is a species of legume native to most of the eastern United States.  It is an annual which grows to approximately 0.5 meters (1 ft 8 in) tall.  It has bright yellow flowers from early summer until first frost, with flowers through the entire flowering season if rainfall is sufficient.
The flowers are hermaphroditic, although a fraction of plants, less than 5%, do not produce sufficient pollen to reproduce as males. This phenomenon has been studied in a variety of plants as a possible evolutionary step towards dioecy, in which male and female flowers occur on separate plants. C. fasciculata is pollinated only by bees.
The flowers have yellow anthers that produce reproductive pollen, and purple anthers that produce food pollen, but no nectar. Long-tongued bees such as bumblebees, honey bees, long-horned bees, and leafcutting bees pollinate the flowers. There are extrafloral nectaries on the leaf stems, which attract a different set of insects: sweat bees, flies, wasps, and ants.
It thrives in areas that have been burned recently before declining in number in the following years. It is a pioneer species, growing densely in depleted sites that cannot support other plants. It is considered an excellent choice for planting in disturbed areas, as it will quickly cover an area, preventing erosion, while still allowing other plants to become established.  It is also grown as an ornamental or for honey production.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Partridge Pea thrives in full sun exposure, mimicking its native open field and prairie environments. It requires moderate, consistent watering, though established plants exhibit good drought tolerance. Fertilization needs are low, especially if grown in moderately fertile soil, as it can fix its own nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a legume, it can fix atmospheric nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen fertilizer is generally not necessary.
