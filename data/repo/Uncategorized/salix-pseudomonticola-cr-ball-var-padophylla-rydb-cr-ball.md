## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The False Mountain Willow thrives in perpetually wet conditions, ideally in full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native montane riparian habitats. Provide abundant, consistent watering and moderate feeding during the growing season to ensure robust health and growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season, especially in nutrient-poor soils. Organic matter enrichment is also beneficial.
