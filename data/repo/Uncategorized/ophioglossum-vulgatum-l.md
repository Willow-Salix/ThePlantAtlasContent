## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe (e.g., United Kingdom, France, Germany), North America (e.g., eastern United States, Canada), and parts of Asia (e.g., China, Japan), with scattered populations in Africa and Australia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests, Temperate Grasslands, specifically found in damp, open woodlands, meadows, fens, and marsh edges. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to full shade. This plant thrives in indirect or dappled light, mimicking the understory of its native woodlands; direct, intense sunlight will scorch its delicate fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture. Keep the soil continuously damp but not waterlogged, reflecting its preference for moist, boggy, or riverside habitats. Allow the very top layer of soil to just begin to dry before re-watering. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Southern Adder's-tongue requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and prefers partial to full shade, mirroring its damp, wooded native habitat. Avoid direct sun exposure and overwatering, and provide light, infrequent fertilization during its active growth period for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Being a fern from often nutrient-rich but not excessively fertile damp soils, a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the active growing season (spring to early summer). Incorporating organic matter into the soil provides a slow-release nutrient source.
