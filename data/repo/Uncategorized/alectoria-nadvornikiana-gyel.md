## 🧤 Care Instructions
Alectoria Nadvornikiana thrives in a cool, highly humid environment with indirect light, mimicking its native montane forest habitat. Providing consistent atmospheric moisture through misting and ensuring very clean air are paramount for its health. Avoid direct sun and all conventional fertilizers as they can be harmful to this sensitive organism.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No conventional fertilizer needed; this lichen is sensitive to nutrient enrichment and air pollution. It obtains necessary trace nutrients naturally from the air and rain.
