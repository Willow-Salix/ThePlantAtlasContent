## 🧤 Care Instructions
Furcraea thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native tropical and subtropical highland environments. It is highly drought-tolerant, necessitating infrequent watering where the soil fully dries between applications. Fertilize sparingly only during the active growing season to support robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring and summer). Over-fertilization should be avoided, as they are adapted to nutrient-poor soils.
