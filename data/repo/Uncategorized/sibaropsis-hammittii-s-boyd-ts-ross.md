## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Grassland with Vernal Pools |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. As an annual growing in open grassland and vernal pool environments, it requires direct sunlight during its active growth phase. |
| **💧 Water** | Abundant water during its active growing season (late winter to late spring), mimicking the inundation of vernal pools. Allow the soil to dry out significantly or completely during the summer months as it completes its annual life cycle. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hammitt's claycress requires a distinct seasonal care strategy, needing full sun and plentiful water from late winter through late spring to simulate its native vernal pool habitat. It thrives in clay-rich soils that experience seasonal inundation followed by a complete dry period, reflecting its annual growth cycle.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native vernal pool soils are often nutrient-poor. A light application of balanced fertilizer during its active growth phase may be beneficial, but heavy feeding is likely unnecessary.
