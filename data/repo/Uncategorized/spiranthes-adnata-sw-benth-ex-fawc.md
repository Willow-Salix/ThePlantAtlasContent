## 🧤 Care Instructions
This terrestrial orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical forest floor origins: consistent moisture, high humidity, and dappled sunlight. Provide bright, indirect light and keep the soil evenly moist but well-drained, fertilizing lightly during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder. Apply a diluted balanced orchid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/2 strength) every 2-4 weeks during the growing season.
