## 🧤 Care Instructions
This crustose lichen requires a humid, tropical rainforest-like environment with low to medium indirect light. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and rain, making high ambient humidity crucial and traditional watering or fertilization methods unnecessary. Protection from direct sun and dry conditions is vital for its survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; this lichen obtains essential nutrients from atmospheric sources and rainwater. Traditional soil-based fertilization is not applicable.
