## 🌱 Overview
Heimia is a genus of flowering plants in the loosestrife family, Lythraceae. It contains two or three species of closely related shrubs commonly known as sun opener or shrubby yellowcrest. They are native to the Americas, from northern Argentina north to the southernmost United States (southern Texas). The leaves are 2–5 cm long and 1 cm broad, entire, and variably arranged alternate, opposite or whorled on the stems. All species produce five-petaled yellow flowers. The plants have a history of medicinal use in a variety of American cultures. Several pharmacologically active alkaloids have been detected in the plants. The generic names honours German physician Ernst Ludwig Heim (1747–1834).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Heimia thrives in sunny, well-draining conditions, mimicking its semi-arid native environment. Water sparingly, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, and fertilize lightly during the growing season. Ensure protection from excessive moisture and poorly draining soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season, or a diluted liquid feed every few weeks. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
