| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across parts of North America (e.g., Alaska, California, Texas), Europe (e.g., Portugal, Sweden), and Asia (e.g., Russia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Rocky outcrops in Temperate to Semi-Arid regions, often in somewhat shaded microhabitats. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers indirect light to partial shade. Avoid prolonged direct sun exposure, especially in hotter climates, as its natural habitat often involves some shading. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lecanora pergibbosa is a crustose lichen found on siliceous rocks in temperate to semi-arid climates, favoring indirect light and high humidity. It requires no supplemental fertilization, acquiring nutrients naturally from its environment, and thrives with occasional moisture followed by dry periods.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients directly from the air, rainwater, and the substrate they grow on.
