## 🧤 Care Instructions
Launaea species are resilient, drought-tolerant plants accustomed to arid and semi-arid environments. They thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal watering and low to moderate fertilization. Their care should mimic their native dry, sunny habitats to ensure healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilization needs; a diluted, balanced fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season is sufficient, or even less in poor soils.
