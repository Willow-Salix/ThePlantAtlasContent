## 🧤 Care Instructions
Motherwort is a resilient plant that prefers temperate climates, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and benefits from minimal fertilization. Its adaptability to average soil conditions makes it relatively low-maintenance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer. Motherwort adapts well to average to poor soils and typically does not require heavy feeding. An annual light application of a balanced fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient if desired.
