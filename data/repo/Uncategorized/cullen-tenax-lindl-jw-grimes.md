## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cullen tenax, originating from the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia, demands full sun and excellent drainage. It is extremely drought-tolerant, necessitating infrequent watering where the soil completely dries out between sessions. Fertilization should be minimal, aligning with its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to poor to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
