## 🌱 Overview
Solanum umbelliferum is a species of nightshade known commonly as bluewitch nightshade,  or bluewitch. It can be found in chaparral habitat and low-elevation oak woodlands in California and parts of Baja California and Arizona. It is a small perennial herb or subshrub with dark gray-green oval-shaped leaves on hairy green stems that grow to a maximum height of one meter. It has bright purple or blue frilly flowers with thick yellow anthers at the center. The flowers close into spherical buds overnight. It bears small round green fruits which turn purple when ripe and resemble tiny eggplants.
It is a tough shrub which can grow in rocky and clay soils and springs up in areas recovering from wildfires or other disturbances. Like most other members of genus Solanum, S. umbelliferum contains toxic alkaloids.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires minimal watering once established, reflecting its Mediterranean climate origins. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it adapts well to leaner soils, making it an easy-care choice for appropriate climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; thrives in nutrient-poor soils. A light application of balanced fertilizer annually in spring is sufficient, or none at all if soil is healthy.
