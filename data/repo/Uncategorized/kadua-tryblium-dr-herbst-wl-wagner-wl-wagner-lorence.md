## 🌱 Overview
Kadua is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It comprises 29 species, all restricted to Polynesia. Twenty-two of these are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. Some of the species are common at high elevation. Others are single-island endemics or very rare, and a few are probably extinct. Kadua affinis is widely distributed in Hawaii and is polymorphic. The type species for the genus is Kadua acuminata.
Kadua was formerly included in a broadly defined and polyphyletic Hedyotis, which encompassed, in addition to Kadua, species now placed in Oldenlandia, Oldenlandiopsis, Houstonia, and other genera. Hedyotis is now circumscribed more narrowly.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Kadua tryblium thrives in conditions similar to its native Hawaiian tropical wet forests. Provide bright indirect light, consistently moist soil, and high humidity. Fertilize sparingly during warmer months to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
