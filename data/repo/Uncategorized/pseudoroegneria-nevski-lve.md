### *Pseudoroegneria (Nevski) Ã . LÃ¶ve*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (e.g., USA, Canada) and temperate parts of Eurasia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Semi-Arid Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed grasslands. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. This plant is highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to semi-arid conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Wheatgrass is the freshly sprouted first leaves of the common wheat plant (Triticum aestivum), used as a food, drink, or dietary supplement. Wheatgrass is served freeze dried or fresh, and so it differs from wheat malt, which is convectively dried. Wheatgrass is allowed to grow longer and taller than wheat malt.
Like most plants, wheatgrass contains chlorophyll, amino acids, minerals, vitamins and enzymes. Claims about the health benefits of wheatgrass range from providing supplemental nutrition to having unique curative properties, but these claims have not been scientifically proven.
Wheatgrass juice is often available at juice bars, and some people grow and juice their own in their homes. It is available fresh as produce, in tablets, frozen juice, and powder. Wheatgrass is also sold commercially as a spray, cream, gel, massage lotion, and liquid herbal supplement. Because it is extracted from wheatgrass sprouts (that is, before the wheat seed or "berry" begins to form), wheatgrass juice is gluten free, but some dietitians recommend that those with celiac disease avoid it due to the risk of cross-contamination.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria) thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, adapting well to temperate grassland and semi-arid steppe conditions. Provide well-drained soil, moderate to infrequent watering, and minimal fertilization once established, allowing for dry periods between waterings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; light fertilization in early spring is sufficient if desired to promote growth, otherwise generally not critical, as it is adapted to lean grassland soils.
