| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States, specifically thermal spring areas in states like Wyoming (e.g., Yellowstone National Park) and adjacent intermountain regions. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Geothermal Spring Habitats |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, as it typically grows in open, exposed areas near thermal features. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil conditions, reflecting its adaptation to areas with continuous water supply from thermal springs. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dichanthelium is genus of flowering plants of the grass family, Poaceae. They are known commonly as rosette grasses and panicgrasses.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This specialized grass requires an environment mimicking its native thermal spring habitats, including full to partial sun exposure. Maintain consistently moist to wet soil, crucial for its survival in geothermally influenced, water-rich conditions. Apply a mild, balanced fertilizer sparingly to support healthy growth without over-enriching the soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate nutrient needs; a balanced, mild fertilizer can be used sparingly, as its natural habitats may have specific, rather than uniformly rich, soil compositions.
