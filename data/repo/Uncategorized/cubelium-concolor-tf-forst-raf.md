| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to full shade, mimicking its understory habitat; avoid direct, intense afternoon sun. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hybanthus (green-violet) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Violaceae. This genus name is Greek for "humpback flower", referring to the drooping pedicels of plants that are part of this genus. The genus is grossly polyphyletic and may contain up to nine different genera, of which Pombalia Vand., Cubelium Raf. and Pigea DC. have been previously recognised.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Green Violet thrives in conditions similar to its native temperate deciduous forest understory. Provide consistent partial to full shade and maintain evenly moist, rich soil. Fertilize moderately during its active growth period to encourage healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to regular fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer) to support its growth in naturally rich soils.
