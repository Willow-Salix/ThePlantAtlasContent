## 🌱 Overview
Rubus odoratus, the purple-flowered raspberry, flowering raspberry, or Virginia raspberry, is a species of Rubus, native to eastern North America, from Nova Scotia west to Ontario and Wisconsin, and south along the Appalachian Mountains as far as Georgia and Alabama.
Rubus odoratus is a shrub growing to 3 metres (10 ft) tall, with perennial, not biennial, stems (unlike many other species in the genus). Also, unlike most other related species this plant does not have thorns.  The leaves are palmately lobed with five (rarely three or seven) lobes, up to 25 cm (10 in) long and broad, superficially resembling maple leaves. The flowers are 3–5 cm (1.2–2.0 in) in diameter, with five magenta or occasionally white petals; they are produced from early spring to early fall. The red edible fruit matures in late summer to early autumn, and resembles a large, flat raspberry with many drupelets, and is rather fuzzy to the touch and tongue.
This species is occasionally referred to as thimbleberry, a name more commonly associated with fellow North American species Rubus parviflorus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Purple-flowering Raspberry thrives in moist, well-drained, rich soil, preferring partial shade but tolerating full sun with consistent moisture. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, and amend the soil with organic matter to mimic its native woodland environment. Minimal fertilization is needed if soil is rich.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Prefers rich, organic soil. Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure annually. A balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil fertility is low.
