## 🧤 Care Instructions
Alpine bentgrass requires cool temperatures, full sun, and consistently moist, very well-drained, lean soils. It is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, therefore minimal fertilization is necessary, and good drainage is paramount to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, lean alpine soils; over-fertilization can be harmful.
