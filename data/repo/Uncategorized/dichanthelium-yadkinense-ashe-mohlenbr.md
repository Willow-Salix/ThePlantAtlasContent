## 🧤 Care Instructions
This panicgrass thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native habitat in humid temperate woods and bogs. Fertilizer needs are low to moderate. It is best to maintain regular watering to support its moisture-loving nature.
