## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including parts of the USA (e.g., Idaho, Washington, Oregon) and Canada (e.g., British Columbia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Moist Woodlands and Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial sun to partial shade; can tolerate full sun in consistently moist, cooler environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, but well-drained soil. Mimic its native habitat by not allowing the soil to dry out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ranunculus  is a large genus of about 1750 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Members of the genus are known as buttercups, spearworts and water crowfoots.
The genus is distributed worldwide, primarily in temperate and montane regions. The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, which has extremely tough and tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much taller meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris. In ornamental  gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.
Buttercups usually flower in the spring, but flowers may be found throughout the summer, especially where the plants are growing as opportunistic colonizers, as in the case of garden weeds.
The water crowfoots (Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium), which grow in still or running water, are sometimes treated in a separate genus Batrachium (from Greek βάτραχος bátrakhos, "frog"). They have two different leaf types, thread-like leaves underwater and broader floating leaves. In some species, such as R. aquatilis, a third, intermediate leaf type occurs.
Ranunculus species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Hebrew character and small angle shades. Some species are popular ornamental flowers in horticulture, with many cultivars selected for large and brightly coloured flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Idaho Buttercup thrives in consistently moist, well-drained soil under partial sun to partial shade conditions, mimicking its native temperate woodland and meadow habitats. It requires consistent moisture and generally minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance native plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; thrives in average to lean soil and typically does not require heavy fertilization, perhaps a light, balanced feed if growth is poor.
