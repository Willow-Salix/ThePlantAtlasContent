## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwest Western Australia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean with seasonally wet, nutrient-poor heathlands and sandy areas |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring several hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist during the active growing season (cooler, wetter months) using distilled, rainwater, or RO water. Reduce watering significantly during its summer dormancy period. |

## 🌱 Overview
Drosera, which is  commonly known as the sundews, is one of the largest genera of carnivorous plants, with at least 194 species. These members of the family Droseraceae lure, capture, and digest insects using stalked mucilaginous glands covering their leaf surfaces. The insects are used to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which the plants grow. Various species, which vary greatly in size and form, are native to every continent except Antarctica.
Charles Darwin performed much of the early research into Drosera, engaging in a long series of experiments with Drosera rotundifolia, which were the first to confirm carnivory in plants.  In an 1860 letter, Darwin wrote, "...at the present moment, I care more about Drosera than the origin of all the species in the world".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This pygmy sundew thrives in conditions mimicking its native Southwest Australian habitat: full sun and consistently moist, nutrient-poor soil during its growing season. Avoid traditional fertilizers, as it captures insects for nutrients. Reduce watering significantly during its summer dormancy period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional soil fertilization. This carnivorous plant obtains all necessary nutrients from trapped insects; fertilizing the roots can be detrimental.
