## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert plant requires full sun exposure and is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering with well-draining soil. It thrives in lean conditions, so fertilizer needs are minimal to none, mimicking its arid native habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; thrives in poor, nutrient-deficient soils. Fertilization is generally not required or can be done very sparingly with a diluted, balanced fertilizer if growth seems stunted.
