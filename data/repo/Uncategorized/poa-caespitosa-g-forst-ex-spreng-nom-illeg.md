| **🌍 Origin** | Australia, New Zealand |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers open, exposed locations characteristic of grasslands. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Allow soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerates periods of drought once established, reflecting adaptation to variable grassland rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Tussock grasses (also known as bunch grasses or hummock grasses) are a group of grass species in the family Poaceae.  They usually grow as singular plants in clumps, tufts, hummocks, or bunches, rather than forming a sod or lawn, in meadows, grasslands, and prairies. As perennial plants, most species live more than one season.  Tussock grasses are often found as forage in pastures and ornamental grasses in gardens.
Many species have long roots that may reach two meters (6+1⁄2 feet) or more into the soil, which can aid slope stabilization, erosion control, and soil porosity for precipitation absorption. Also, their roots can reach moisture more deeply than other grasses and annual plants during seasonal or climatic droughts. The plants provide habitat and food for insects (including Lepidoptera), birds, small animals and larger herbivores, and support beneficial soil mycorrhiza. The leaves supply material, such as for basket weaving, for indigenous peoples and contemporary artists.
Tussock and bunch grasses occur in almost any habitat where other grasses are found, including: grasslands, savannas and prairies, wetlands and estuaries, riparian zones, shrublands and scrublands, woodlands and forests, montane and alpine zones, tundra and dunes, and deserts.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tussock Grass is a robust plant that thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate watering, becoming drought-tolerant once established. It is low-maintenance regarding soil fertility, making it an adaptable choice for various garden and landscape conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally thrives in average to poor soils without heavy fertilization. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if desired.
