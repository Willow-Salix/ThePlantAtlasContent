## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade to bright indirect light, mimicking its native temperate rocky outcrops. It requires consistent moisture, either through regular misting or keeping its substrate damp, but absolutely needs excellent drainage to prevent rot. Fertilizer is generally unnecessary, as it has minimal nutrient requirements.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; mosses thrive on low nutrients and absorb from water/air.
