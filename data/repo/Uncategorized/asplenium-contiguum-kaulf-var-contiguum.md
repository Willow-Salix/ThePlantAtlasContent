## 🌱 Overview
Asplenium is a genus of about 700 species of ferns, often treated as the only genus in the family Aspleniaceae, though other authors consider Hymenasplenium separate, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, a different chromosome count, and structural differences in the rhizomes. The type species for the genus is Asplenium marinum.
The most common vernacular name is spleenworts, applied to the more "typical" species. A. nidus and several similar species are called bird's-nest ferns, the Camptosorus group is known as walking ferns, and distinct names are applied to some other particularly well-known species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Forest Spleenwort, provide a consistently moist, humid environment with indirect, low to medium light, replicating its native tropical rainforest conditions. Water frequently to keep the substrate moist but well-drained, and apply a diluted fertilizer sparingly during active growth to support healthy fronds.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer), as ferns in their native habitat derive nutrients from decaying organic matter.
