## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Alaska (USA), Yukon Territory (Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subarctic |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright light conditions, mimicking open alpine environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot, common in well-drained rocky tundra soils. |

## 🌱 Overview
Minuartia is a genus of flowering plants commonly known as sandworts in the family Caryophyllaceae.
Minuartias are small annual or perennial plants which grow in otherwise inhospitable conditions such as on rocky ledges and in stony soil. Species are distributed in Eurasia and parts of Africa, including Europe, the Mediterranean region, northern and eastern Africa, the Caucasus, western and central Asia, Japan, and Far Eastern Russia.
Many Minuartia species were formerly classed in the genus Arenaria, and the obsolete genus Alsine. In 2014, the polyphyletic Minuartia sensu lato was recircumscribed, with many of the species transferred to other genera, including Cherleria, Eremogone, Facchinia, Mcneillia, Minuartiella, Mononeuria, Pseudocherleria, Rhodalsine, Sabulina, and Triplateia. Minuartia sensu stricto is characterized by the following features: leaves linear-setaceous; 5 acute sepals with 3, 5, or 9-veins; 5 white petals; 3 styles, forming 3-parted capsules.
The genus was named for Juan Minuart (1693–1768), a Spanish botanist and pharmacist.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To cultivate Yukon Stitchwort, provide full sun and ensure highly well-drained soil to emulate its native alpine tundra habitat. Water moderately, allowing the substrate to dry out between applications, and keep fertilization to a minimum to avoid nutrient burn.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Native alpine soils are typically lean, so infrequent or no fertilization is usually best, especially if potted in a rich substrate.
