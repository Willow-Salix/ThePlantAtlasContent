| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (natural hybrid found in Florida and Georgia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Wetland/Bog |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to encourage vigorous growth and good pitcher coloration. |
| **💧 Water** | Maintain consistently moist to wet conditions; pots should sit in 1-2 inches of standing water at all times. Use only distilled water, rainwater, or reverse osmosis water due to sensitivity to minerals. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pitcher plants are  carnivorous plants that have modified leaves known as pitfall traps—prey-trapping mechanisms featuring a deep cavity filled with digestive liquid. The traps of what are considered to be "true" pitcher plants are formed by specialized leaves. The plants attract and drown the prey with nectar.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sarracenia ×gilpinii, a subtropical bog plant, demands abundant full sun and consistently wet, mineral-free soil. Ensure its pot always sits in standing distilled or rainwater to mimic its native wetland habitat. Avoid fertilizing, as the plant catches its own prey for nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed; these carnivorous plants obtain nutrients by catching insects. Fertilizing can burn their roots and harm the plant.
