## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado), specifically the Colorado Plateau region. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, unshaded desert/scrubland habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Very infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking the sporadic rainfall patterns of its native arid climate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wetherill's Cryptantha thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland environment. Provide full sun exposure and water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between applications. Fertilization is generally not required for this drought-adapted plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; these plants are adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils and do not require rich fertilization.
