## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mountainous and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe (e.g., Alps) and North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra to Temperate Montane |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers bright, indirect light to full sun, especially in cooler, high-altitude conditions on exposed rocks. Requires good air circulation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires intermittent moisture from rain, dew, or high atmospheric humidity, followed by periods of complete drying. Avoid constant wetness; good drainage and air circulation are essential. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rinodina is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 265 species. It is hypothesized that a few saxicolous species common to dry regions of western North America, southern Europe, North Africa and central Asia may date back 240 million years to the Middle Triassic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rinodina lichen thrives in cool, well-ventilated conditions typical of alpine and montane environments. Provide bright light and intermittent moisture, ensuring periods of dryness between waterings. Avoid any form of fertilization, as these organisms are adapted to nutrient-poor substrates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilization required. Lichens are highly efficient at acquiring nutrients from the air and their substrate (rocks); added nutrients can be detrimental.
