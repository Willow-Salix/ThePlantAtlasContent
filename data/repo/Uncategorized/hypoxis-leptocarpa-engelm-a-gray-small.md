| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical, found in open, moist habitats such as savannas, pine flatwoods, marshes, and ditches |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun (at least 6 hours direct sun) to partial shade. Full sun is optimal for vigorous growth and flowering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hypoxis  is a  genus of flowering plants of the family Hypoxidaceae. The genus has an "almost cosmopolitan" distribution, occurring in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Australia. Europe lacks native species. Most species are in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in southern Africa. Common names for the genus include star-grass, star lily, yellow stars, African potato, and stars. The genus is the largest of the Hypoxidaceae and has its centre of variation in South Africa, where it occurs in open undisturbed grasslands. The name Hypoxis was taken over by Linnaeus in 1759 from a name coined by Paul Reneaulme in 1611 for a superficially similar species of Gagea and meaning "a little sour", referring to the taste of that plant's leaves.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Slender-flower Star Grass thrives in full sun to partial shade, needing consistently moist but well-drained soil to emulate its native humid subtropical wetland margins. Regular watering and a light feeding during its growth period will support healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer application during its active growing season, particularly if grown in nutrient-poor soils. Avoid over-fertilization.
