## 🌱 Overview
Acleisanthes is a genus of flowering plants in the Bougainvillea family, Nyctaginaceae. There are currently 16 species. The generic name is derived from the Greek words ακλειοτος (akleistos), meaning "not closed", and ανθος (anthos), meaning "flower". Plants of this genus are known commonly as trumpets due to the elongated, open-ended shape of their flowers. These are arid-adapted perennials with thick taproots which are usually compact and low to the ground or slightly ascending. An individual plant may have cleistogamous (unopening and self-pollinating) flowers as well as opening flowers which are usually nocturnal as a water-saving adaptation and are pollinated by night-flying or crepuscular insects such as hawkmoths. Flowers are usually white, sometimes yellow. These plants are native to the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts of Mexico and the United States.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in its native arid desert conditions, requiring full sun exposure and minimal water. Provide infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications, and avoid over-fertilization as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to lean desert soils and generally does not require significant fertilization. If needed, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring.
