## 🧤 Care Instructions
This mountain goldenrod prefers full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native open forest and clearing habitats in the Appalachian Mountains. Provide consistent moisture through moderate watering, ensuring good drainage, and apply fertilizer sparingly as it adapts well to average soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; it is adapted to average to poor soil conditions found in its natural habitat and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient if growth is poor.
