## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in bright, open conditions and requires consistently moist, yet exceptionally well-drained soil, mimicking its native rocky, meltwater-fed environments. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, mineral-rich substrates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Native soils are typically lean and mineral-rich, so over-fertilization can be detrimental. A very dilute, balanced fertilizer might be applied once in spring for potted specimens, but is often unnecessary.
