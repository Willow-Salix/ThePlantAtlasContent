## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mexico, Central America, south to Ecuador and Bolivia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Warm Temperate Montane Forests (e.g., Pine-Oak Forests, Cloud Forests) |
| **☀️ Light** | Thrives in full sun to partial shade, mimicking its native habitat in forest clearings and open woodlands. Prefers bright, indirect light in hotter climates to prevent leaf scorch. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular watering during its active growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry out slightly between waterings. Its native rocky slopes indicate a need for excellent drainage; reduce watering frequency during any dormant period. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This montane legume thrives in bright conditions, from full sun to partial shade, and prefers regular watering during its growth cycle with excellent drainage. A light, balanced fertilizer supports its health, but excessive nitrogen is unnecessary due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a light to moderate application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen is generally not needed.
