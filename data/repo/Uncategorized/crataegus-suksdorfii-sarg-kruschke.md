## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Pacific Northwest, including British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Northern California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Woodland/Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it can be found in open woodlands and forest edges, suggesting it tolerates direct sunlight but can handle some dappled shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, especially when young. Native to areas with wet winters and drier summers, established plants are somewhat drought-tolerant but appreciate consistent moisture during prolonged dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Suksdorf's Hawthorn, originating from the temperate woodlands of the Pacific Northwest, requires full sun to partial shade and moderate, consistent watering. It is relatively adaptable once established and benefits from minimal fertilization in early spring. Allow soil to dry slightly between waterings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to fertile woodland soils. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in early spring should be sufficient, particularly if soil fertility is low.
