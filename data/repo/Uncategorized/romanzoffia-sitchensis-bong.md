There are 5 species which are native to western North America from California north to Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sitka mistmaiden thrives in cool, moist, shaded conditions reminiscent of its Pacific Northwest origins. Provide consistently moist soil with good drainage, protecting it from harsh sun. A light annual feeding will support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied sparingly once a year in spring should suffice, as its native rocky habitats are not typically nutrient-rich.
