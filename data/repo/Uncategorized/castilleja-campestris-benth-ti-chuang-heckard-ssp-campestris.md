## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (Central Valley and surrounding foothills) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Vernal Pool (seasonal wetlands within a Mediterranean climate) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily); thrives in open, unshaded environments. |
| **💧 Water** | High moisture during the growing season (winter to late spring), mimicking seasonal inundation; followed by a complete dry dormancy period during summer and early fall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant requires full sun and a strict seasonal watering regime: consistently wet to flooded during its winter/spring growing period, followed by complete summer dormancy with no water. It is hemiparasitic, needing host plants to thrive, and prefers lean, unfertilized soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; prefers lean, often clay-based soils typical of vernal pools. As a hemiparasite, it obtains nutrients from host plants.
