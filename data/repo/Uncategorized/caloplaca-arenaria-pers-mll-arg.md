## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions on sandy or rocky substrates. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and precipitation, making traditional watering and fertilization unnecessary. Ensure good air circulation and intermittent natural wetting for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Obtains all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and rainwater.
