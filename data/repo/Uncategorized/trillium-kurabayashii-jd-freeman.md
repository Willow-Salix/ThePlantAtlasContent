## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern California and southwestern Oregon, United States |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically, redwood forests and mixed evergreen forests) |
| **☀️ Light** | Part-shade to full shade; protection from direct afternoon sun is crucial, as it naturally grows under a dense forest canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, but well-draining, soil during its active growing season in spring. Reduce watering significantly as the plant enters dormancy in late summer or fall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Trillium (trillium, wakerobin, toadshade, tri flower, birthroot, birthwort, and sometimes "wood lily") is a genus of about fifty flowering plant species in the family Melanthiaceae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This woodland perennial needs a cool, shady location with rich, consistently moist, and well-draining soil to mimic its native forest floor habitat. Protect it from intense sunlight and allow for a natural summer dormancy with reduced watering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in naturally rich, humus-filled soil. Amend annually with leaf mold or compost; a light application of a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer in early spring is beneficial.
