| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light or partial shade. Avoid direct, intense midday sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **💧 Water** | Frequent watering during the active growing season, allowing the potting medium to dry slightly between waterings. High humidity (60-80%) is essential, often achieved with misting or a humidity tray. |

## 🌱 Overview
Epidendrum , abbreviated Epi in the horticultural trade, is a large neotropical genus of the orchid family. With more than 1,500 species,  some authors describe it as a mega-genus. The genus name (from Greek επί, epi and δένδρον, dendron, "upon trees") refers to its epiphytic growth habit.
When Carl Linnaeus named this genus in 1763, he included in this genus all the epiphytic orchids known to him. Although few of these orchids are still included in the genus Epidendrum, some species of Epidendrum are nevertheless not epiphytic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical and subtropical moist forests, requiring bright, indirect light, high humidity, and consistent moisture. Ensure excellent drainage and provide regular, dilute fertilization during its active growth period to support its vigorous nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed weekly to bi-weekly with a weak, balanced orchid-specific fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 to 1/2 strength) during the growing season. Reduce or cease fertilization during dormancy.
