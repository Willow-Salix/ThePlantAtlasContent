## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical humid forest habitat. Provide consistently high humidity and low to medium indirect light, ensuring it never fully dries out for prolonged periods. Avoid using any traditional fertilizers, as it relies on atmospheric nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. As a lichen, it absorbs nutrients directly from the atmosphere and rainwater; typical plant fertilizers would be detrimental.
