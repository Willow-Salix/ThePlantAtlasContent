## 🧤 Care Instructions
Silver Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained, even poor, soils, reflecting its native montane and semi-arid origins. It is drought-tolerant once established and should be watered infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires little to no fertilizer, particularly avoiding high-nitrogen formulations.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers which can inhibit flowering.
