## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hairy Bugseed thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils, mimicking its native arid grassland habitat. It requires infrequent watering, tolerating drought, and has minimal fertilizer needs for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; native to often nutrient-poor, sandy soils, so apply a balanced, dilute fertilizer sparingly, if at all, during the growing season.
