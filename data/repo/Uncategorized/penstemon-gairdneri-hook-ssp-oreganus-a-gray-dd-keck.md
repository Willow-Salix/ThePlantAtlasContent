## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Pacific Northwest (eastern Oregon and southeastern Washington, USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Steppe / Semi-Arid Temperate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and flowering). |
| **💧 Water** | Low to Moderate; drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during the dry summer months. |

## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Penstemon subspecies thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate steppe environment of the Pacific Northwest. It requires full sun exposure and well-draining soil, tolerating drought once established due to its adaptation to semi-arid climates. Minimal fertilization is needed for its best health, promoting robust growth without encouraging excessive, weak foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. This plant thrives in lean to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization. If desired, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring.
