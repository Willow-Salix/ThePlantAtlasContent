## 🌱 Overview
Hesperis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Most are native to Eurasia, with several endemic to Greece and Turkey. Many plants of this genus bear showy, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and white. One of the more widely known species is the common garden flower Hesperis matronalis.
The genus name Hesperis was probably given because the scent of the flowers becomes more conspicuous towards evening (Hespera is the Greek word for evening).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rockcress thrives in eastern North America's temperate woodlands and clearings. Provide full sun to partial shade and moderate, consistent watering with good drainage. It is not a heavy feeder and generally requires minimal fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced slow-release granular fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or omit if soil is naturally rich.
