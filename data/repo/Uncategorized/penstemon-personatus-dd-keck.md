## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Closethroat Beardtongue thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires excellent drainage to mimic its native Mediterranean chaparral habitat. Water moderately during its spring growth and bloom, then significantly reduce watering as it enters summer dormancy, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically does not require fertilizer as it is adapted to lean soils. If growth is poor, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial. Avoid rich soils and high nitrogen.
