## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Dry Forest and Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), as it thrives in open, exposed areas in its native range. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its native wet and dry seasons. More frequent watering is needed during establishment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Schinus is a genus of flowering trees and tall shrubs in the sumac family, Anacardiaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as pepper trees. The Peruvian pepper tree (Schinus molle) is the source of the spice known as pink peppercorn.
The species of Schinus are native to South America, ranging from Peru and northeastern Brazil to southern South America. Some species (e.g. Schinus terebinthifolia) have become an invasive species outside their natural habitats. Schinus polygama, although less well known, is also potentially weedy in mesic areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Brazilian Peppertree is a robust plant native to subtropical South America, adapted to sunny, open conditions and capable of withstanding drought. Provide it with full sun and water deeply but infrequently once established. Minimal fertilization is required as it tolerates average to poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. This plant thrives in average to poor soils in its native habitat and typically does not require regular fertilization. Fertilize sparingly only if nutrient deficiency is observed.
