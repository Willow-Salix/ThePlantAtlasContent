## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. It is highly drought-tolerant and prefers lean soil, thus needing minimal to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. Native desert soils are typically lean, so rich soil or frequent feeding can be detrimental. If necessary, use a very dilute, low-phosphorus fertilizer sparingly.
