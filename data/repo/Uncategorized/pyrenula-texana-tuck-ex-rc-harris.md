## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen thrives in a humid subtropical environment, necessitating consistently high humidity and indirect light. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere and rainfall, thus not requiring traditional watering or fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally does not require supplemental fertilizer, as it obtains necessary nutrients from airborne particles, rainwater, and the substrate it grows on.
