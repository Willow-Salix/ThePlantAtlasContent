## 🌱 Overview
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This annual plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid scrubland and chaparral habitats. It requires infrequent to moderate watering during its growing cycle, allowing the soil to dry completely between applications, and prefers minimal fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; generally thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once at the start of the growing season if soil is very deficient.
