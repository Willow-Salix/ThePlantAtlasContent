## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, California, Utah) and Northern Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Grassland and Desert Scrub |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open habitat in desert and grassland environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Deep but infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, mimicking its native habitat where water is scarce but sometimes intense; highly drought-tolerant once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Setaria is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family. The name is derived from the Latin word seta, meaning "bristle" or "hair", which refers to the bristly spikelets.
The genus includes over 100 species distributed in many tropical and temperate regions around the world, and members are commonly known as foxtail or bristle grasses.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Streambed bristlegrass thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring deep, infrequent watering to mimic its native arid streambed environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal fertilization once established, making it a low-maintenance plant suitable for xeriscaping.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; these plants are adapted to nutrient-poor soils of arid regions and typically do not require regular fertilization. A very light, balanced fertilizer in spring might be beneficial only in extremely poor soils.
