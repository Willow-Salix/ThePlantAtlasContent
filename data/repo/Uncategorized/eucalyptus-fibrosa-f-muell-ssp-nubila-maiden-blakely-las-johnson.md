## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Queensland, Australia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun exposure (at least 6-8 hours direct sun daily) to thrive, mimicking its open woodland habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to periods of lower rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Eucalypt thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, tolerating dry conditions once mature. Water moderately and fertilize sparingly with a low-phosphorus product to mimic its native subtropical woodland environment, ensuring robust growth without nutrient imbalance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer required. If necessary, use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer specifically formulated for Australian native plants, as they are adapted to nutrient-poor soils.
