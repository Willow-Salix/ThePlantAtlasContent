## 🌱 Overview
Rock tripe is the common name for various lichens of the genus Umbilicaria that grow on rocks. They are widely distributed, including on bare rock in Antarctica, and throughout northern parts of North America such as New England and the Rocky Mountains. They are edible when properly prepared; soaking extensively and boiling with changes of water removes the bitterness and purgative properties. They have been used as a famine food in extreme cases when other food sources were unavailable, as by early American northern explorers.
Umbilicaria esculenta is commonly used as a food in Asian cuisine and a restorative medicine in traditional Chinese medicine.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions, mimicking its native rock habitats. It requires infrequent rehydration, allowing complete drying between waterings, and does not need traditional fertilization as it absorbs nutrients from the air.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None required; lichens absorb nutrients from the air and water, not from soil.
