| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Basin (Southern Europe, North Africa, Western Asia) |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dittrichia thrives in full sun exposure and well-draining, even poor, soil. Mimic its Mediterranean origins by providing ample sunlight and allowing the soil to dry out between infrequent waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Minimal fertilization is needed for this resilient plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Dittrichia thrives in nutrient-poor soils; avoid over-fertilizing. A single, light application of a balanced fertilizer in spring is optional if growth appears stunted.
