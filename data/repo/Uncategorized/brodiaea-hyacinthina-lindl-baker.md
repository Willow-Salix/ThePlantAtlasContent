## 🌱 Overview
Brodiaea , also known by the common name cluster-lilies, is a monocot genus of flowering plants.
One school of thought places the genus in the family Themidaceae, while another school of thought places it in the subfamily Brodiaeoideae of the family Asparagaceae.  The USDA Plants Database still classifies the genus Brodiaea in the family Liliaceae.
Brodiaea species occur along the Pacific Coast region of North America, from British Columbia throughout California into the Baja California Peninsula. They are especially common in northern California.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives with a distinct seasonal watering pattern: moderate moisture during its active growth in spring, followed by a dry dormancy period in summer. Ensure well-drained soil and ample sunlight for optimal flowering, mimicking its native grassland and woodland habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once or twice during active growth, but generally not a heavy feeder.
