## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and boreal regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada), Europe (e.g., Fennoscandia, Russia), and Greenland. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Boreal Forest (subalpine zones). |
| **☀️ Light** | High exposure to bright, often direct sunlight, typical of open rocky habitats, but with tolerance for some partial shade. Requires good air circulation. |
| **💧 Water** | Absorbs moisture directly from air, fog, and precipitation. Requires frequent periods of high humidity and occasional wetting (e.g., misting or rainfall), followed by dry periods to prevent rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Haematomma is a genus of crustose lichens established by Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo in 1852. It is the sole genus in the Haematommataceae, a family circumscribed by Josef Hafellner in 1984. Commonly called bloodstain lichens, the species assigned to this genus are widely distributed in tropical and temperate areas.
The genus name Haematomma means "bloody eye", a reference to the color of the lichen's apothecia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen from cold, exposed alpine and arctic environments thrives with bright, often direct light and high air humidity or frequent misting to provide moisture. It does not require soil or traditional fertilization, as it absorbs nutrients directly from the air and substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required. Lichens are sensitive to nutrient imbalances and airborne pollutants; external fertilization is generally harmful.
