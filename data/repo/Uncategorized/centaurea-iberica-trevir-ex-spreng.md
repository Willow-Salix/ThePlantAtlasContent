## 🧤 Care Instructions
Iberian knapweed is a robust plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean and semi-arid regions. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering to avoid root rot. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to less fertile conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to low fertilization; adapted to poor to average, well-draining soils. Over-fertilization is generally not recommended.
