## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate and boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere, including regions like the Pacific Northwest of North America and Northern Europe. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate/Boreal Forest (characterized by cool temperatures, high humidity, and stable, sheltered conditions). |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to partial indirect light, sheltered from direct sun. It thrives in the dim understory or on shaded sides of trees in dense forests. |
| **💧 Water** | High ambient humidity is crucial. Regular misting or placement in a humid environment (terrarium-like) would be beneficial. It absorbs moisture from the air and surface, not requiring traditional soil watering. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen requires a cool, humid, and stable environment with low indirect light. Provide high ambient humidity through misting, and avoid direct sunlight. No fertilization is necessary, as it obtains nutrients from its environment and decaying substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is needed. Lichens are highly sensitive to excess nutrients, which can be detrimental. They derive necessary elements from air and precipitation, and the decaying substrate.
