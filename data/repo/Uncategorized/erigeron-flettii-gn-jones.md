## 🧤 Care Instructions
Flett's Fleabane flourishes in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its native alpine conditions. Water moderately, ensuring the soil dries slightly between applications, and apply fertilizer sparingly, if at all, to avoid over-enrichment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; native alpine soils are typically lean. If necessary, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once in spring.
