## 🧤 Care Instructions
Neckeropsis moss requires high humidity and consistent moisture, mirroring its native tropical forest floor environment. Provide low to medium indirect light, avoiding any direct sun exposure. Fertilization needs are minimal; use a very diluted solution infrequently.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses like Neckeropsis obtain most nutrients from rain and decaying organic matter. If desired, apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) sparingly, no more than once or twice a year during periods of active growth.
