# No widely recognized common name
### *Dicraurus leptocladus Hook. f.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in Tropical Africa, particularly found in countries across Central and West Africa such as Cameroon, Congo, Central African Republic, and Nigeria. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Moist Grasslands and Savannas, often inhabiting seasonally wet areas, stream banks, or swamps. Characterized by warm temperatures year-round with distinct wet and dry seasons. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Given its native habitat in open grasslands and edges of watercourses, it thrives with significant direct sunlight exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, especially during its active growing season (mimicking the tropical wet season). It can tolerate periods of slight drying between waterings, particularly if grown as a perennial with a dormant period. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical African herb thrives in warm, humid environments with ample sunlight. It requires consistently moist soil, especially during its main growth phase, and benefits from moderate, regular fertilization. Mimicking the native wet and dry seasonal cycle is ideal for its cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer applied monthly during the active growing period will support healthy foliage and flowering, reflecting typical nutrient availability in grassland soils.
