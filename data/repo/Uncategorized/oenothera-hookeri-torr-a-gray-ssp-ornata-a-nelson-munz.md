## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hooker's Evening Primrose thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflective of its native Mediterranean and arid scrubland environments. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent deep watering during dry spells. Minimal fertilization is needed to ensure robust flowering and prevent excessive foliage growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Excessive fertilization can lead to more foliage and fewer flowers. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring is sufficient if needed.
