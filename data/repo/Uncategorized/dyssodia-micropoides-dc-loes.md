## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Mexico (Hidalgo, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | High-Altitude Semi-Arid Scrubland (Matorral Xerófilo) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright, direct light for several hours daily to maintain its compact form and vibrant leaf coloration. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant. Water thoroughly only when the soil is completely dry to the touch, typically every 2-4 weeks. Reduce watering significantly during cooler, dormant months. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dyssodia is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Many species formerly included in Dyssodia are now treated as members of other related genera, including Thymophylla or Adenophyllum. Dyssodia papposa is usually retained in this genus.  The name is derived from the Greek δυσοδια (dusodia), meaning "ill-smelling".
Several species of Dyssodia (sensu lato) have found their way into the nursery trade and are relatively popular flowering annuals for hot, dry sites.  Generally sold as threadleaf dyssodia (Dyssodia tenuisecta) and golden dyssodia (Dyssodia cf. pentachaeta).  They perform best in well-drained soil.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This succulent thrives in environments mimicking its high-altitude semi-arid native habitat, requiring abundant bright light and infrequent, thorough watering after the soil has fully dried. It is highly susceptible to rot from overwatering and prefers well-draining soil mixes. Minimal fertilization is needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needs. Fertilize sparingly (once or twice during the growing season) with a diluted succulent-specific fertilizer, if desired, or if growth appears stunted.
