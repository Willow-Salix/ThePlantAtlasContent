## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate coastal regions of Western Europe (e.g., British Isles, Atlantic coast of France) and parts of North America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Maritime |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to light shade. Thrives in full sun, reflecting its open, coastal native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate and consistent; native sandy coastal soils are well-drained but receive regular moisture from maritime climate. Allow soil to dry slightly between waterings; exhibits good drought tolerance once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca rubra is a species of grass known by the common name red fescue, creeping red fescue or the rush-leaf fescue. It is widespread across much of the Northern Hemisphere and can tolerate many habitats and climates. It is best adapted to well-drained soils in cool, temperate climates; it prefers shadier areas and is often planted for its shade tolerance. Wild animals browse it, but it has not been important for domestic forage due to low productivity and palatability. It is also an ornamental plant for gardens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Red Fescue subspecies excels in full sun within temperate maritime environments. It requires moderate, consistent watering in well-draining soil, mimicking its sandy coastal origins. It thrives on lean nutrient levels, so avoid heavy fertilization to maintain its natural hardiness.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; native coastal soils are often nutrient-poor. Fertilize sparingly in spring if growth is desired, otherwise, it tolerates lean conditions well.
