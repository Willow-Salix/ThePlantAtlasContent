# Ames' Moss
### *Camptothecium amesiae Renauld & Cardot*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (primarily Pacific Northwest of USA and British Columbia, Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial Shade to Full Shade. This moss is sensitive to direct, intense sunlight and thrives in filtered or indirect light. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist, never allowing the substrate to dry out completely. High humidity is crucial for its well-being, mimicking its native forest floor environment. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ames' Moss thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions typical of its native temperate forests. Ensure consistent moisture and high humidity, avoiding direct sunlight and strong air currents. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as mosses are not heavy feeders.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Mosses obtain most of their nutrients from their environment (rainwater, decaying organic matter), and excessive fertilization can be harmful.
