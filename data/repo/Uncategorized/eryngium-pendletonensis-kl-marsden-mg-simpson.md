## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern California, USA (specifically San Diego County) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (maritime chaparral and coastal sage scrub) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. Thrives in open, exposed environments with direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Requires regular watering during its active growing season in cooler months, but must be kept dry during hot, dry summers when it may go dormant. Highly drought-tolerant once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eryngium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. There are about 250 species. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, with centres of diversity in the western Mediterranean, South America and Mexico. Common names include eryngo and sea holly (though not to be confused with true hollies, of the genus Ilex).
These are annual and perennial herbs with hairless and usually spiny leaves. The dome-shaped umbels of steely blue or white flowers have whorls of spiny basal bracts. European and Asian species tend to be native to dry, rocky and coastal areas, and the American species are native to often damp grasslands.
In the language of flowers, they represent admiration.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pendleton's eryngo thrives in full sun and highly well-draining soil, mimicking its native Southern California Mediterranean climate. Provide moderate water during its active growth in cooler months and ensure dry conditions during its summer dormancy. It prefers lean soils and requires minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, well-draining soils; excessive fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful. A very light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring may be beneficial if growth is sluggish.
