## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate Western Europe (e.g., Great Britain, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal), Macaronesia, and parts of North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Oceanic/Maritime, characterized by high humidity and regular rainfall, typically found in woodlands and forests. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers partial shade to bright indirect light, often found on tree bark beneath canopies. Can tolerate more sun if ambient humidity is consistently high. |
| **💧 Water** | As a lichen, it absorbs moisture directly from the atmosphere (rain, dew, fog). Requires consistently high ambient humidity and regular exposure to atmospheric moisture; typical watering methods for vascular plants are not applicable. |

## 🌱 Overview
Catillaria is a genus of crustose lichens in the family Catillariaceae. The genus was circumscribed by Italian lichenologist Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo in 1852. It is the type genus of Catillariaceae, which was circumscribed by Austrian lichenologist Josef Hafellner in 1984.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in highly humid, temperate environments with clean air and regular atmospheric moisture. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade, and ensure very high ambient humidity, as it directly absorbs water from the air. Avoid traditional watering and fertilization, as these are detrimental to its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Lichens are sensitive to high nutrient levels and do not require traditional fertilization. They obtain necessary trace nutrients from the air and substrate; good air quality is more important than specific fertilizers.
