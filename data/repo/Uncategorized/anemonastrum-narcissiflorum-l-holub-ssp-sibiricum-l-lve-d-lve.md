| **🌍 Origin** | Siberia, Mongolia, China (Xinjiang), Central Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Subalpine Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring full sun in cooler climates or higher altitudes to mimic its native open-field exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil, especially during the growing season. Water regularly, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings, but avoid waterlogging, particularly in winter. |

## 🌱 Overview
Anemonastrum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Plants of the genus are native to the temperate and subarctic regions of North America, Greenland, Europe, Asia, South America, and New Zealand. The generic name Anemonastrum means "somewhat like anemone", a reference to the Anemone genus of closely related plants.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, especially in cooler regions. Provide consistent moisture during its growing period, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its adaptation to lean, rocky native soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Native alpine soils are often lean, so a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in early spring is usually sufficient; avoid over-fertilization.
