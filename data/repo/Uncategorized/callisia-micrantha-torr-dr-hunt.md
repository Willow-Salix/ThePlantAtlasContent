## 🌱 Overview
Callisia is a genus of flowering plants in the spiderwort family, Commelinaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as roselings. It is native to the Western Hemisphere from the southern United States to Argentina. The generic name is derived from the Greek word κάλλος (kallos), meaning "beauty."
Some members of Callisia may cause allergic reactions in pets (especially cats and dogs), characterised by red, itchy skin.  Notable culprits are C. fragrans (inch plant) and C. repens (turtle vine).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To cultivate Littleflower Roseling, replicate its native shaded, moist woodland habitat. Provide consistent moisture to the soil, ensure it receives partial to full shade, and offer a dilute, balanced fertilizer during active growth for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, dilute liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer), as native woodland soils are moderately rich in organic matter.
