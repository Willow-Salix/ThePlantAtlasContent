## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Owyhee Mountains region of Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane Grassland/Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day) |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil, never allowing it to dry out completely. Requires regular watering, especially during dry spells, to replicate its native moist meadow and stream bank habitats. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Owyhee Clover thrives in full sun to partial sun and requires consistently moist soil, reflecting its native wet meadow habitat. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has low fertilizer needs, with a light, low-nitrogen application or compost once a year being sufficient.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nitrogen requirements due to nitrogen fixation. A light application of a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer or compost once annually can be beneficial, but often not strictly necessary in fertile soils.
