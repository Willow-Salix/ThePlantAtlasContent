## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mung beans flourish in warm, tropical environments with abundant direct sunlight and consistent moisture, especially during their growth phases. Provide well-draining soil and avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization due to their natural nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a legume, mung beans fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, reducing the need for high-nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced fertilizer or compost at planting is beneficial, focusing on phosphorus and potassium if soil tests indicate deficiencies; healthy soil rich in organic matter is preferred.
