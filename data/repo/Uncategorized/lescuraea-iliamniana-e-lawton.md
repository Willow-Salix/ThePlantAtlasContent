### *Lescuraea iliamniana E. Lawton*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Alaska, USA (North America) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Tundra, Boreal Forest margins (often in cool, moist, rocky areas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low light to deep shade. Avoid any direct sunlight as it can scorch the moss. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high humidity and a constantly moist substrate. Do not allow to dry out between waterings. Regular misting is highly beneficial. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in very low light and high humidity, mimicking its cool, shaded native habitat. Maintain a consistently moist substrate and mist frequently, ensuring it never dries out. Fertilizer is generally not required and should be avoided or applied very sparingly if at all.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low to none. Mosses typically absorb nutrients from water and air; too much fertilizer can be detrimental.
