## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Round-fruited Sharp Rush requires a full sun location and consistently wet to submerged conditions, mimicking its native coastal marsh environment. Ensure constant moisture and provide low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to specific wetland soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. In its natural habitat, it adapts to varying nutrient levels in marsh soils. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer designed for aquatic plants can be applied sparingly if growth appears weak, but over-fertilization should be avoided.
