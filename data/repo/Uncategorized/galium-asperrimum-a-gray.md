## 🌱 Overview
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in partial to full sun and prefers moderate watering, with soil allowed to dry slightly between sessions. It is adapted to average soil nutrient levels and does not require heavy fertilization. Mimicking its native temperate woodland and chaparral environment will ensure optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it's adapted to average woodland soils. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring should suffice, or none if soil is naturally fertile.
