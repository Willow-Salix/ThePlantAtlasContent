## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Scandinavia, Greenland, northern North America, and parts of Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic Tundra, Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. It tolerates exposed conditions in its native environment but prefers cooler temperatures; avoid intense direct sun in warm climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, but well-drained conditions, and high humidity. While capable of surviving periods of desiccation, active growth necessitates regular misting and a perpetually damp (not waterlogged) substrate. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arctic/alpine moss thrives in cool temperatures with bright indirect to partial sun exposure. It requires consistently moist, well-drained conditions and high humidity to flourish, with minimal to no fertilizer needed. Replicating its harsh, exposed, yet often damp native environment is crucial for its care.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Tundra environments are nutrient-poor, and mosses absorb nutrients primarily from water and air. If used, apply a highly diluted, specialized moss or orchid fertilizer very sparingly.
