## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Macoun's Willow is a cold-hardy plant best suited for locations with full to partial sun exposure and consistently wet soil. Emulate its native bog and streambank habitats by providing ample moisture and good light, while its fertilizer needs are generally modest.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate; typically not a heavy feeder, but can benefit from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer in nutrient-poor soils during the growing season.
