## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native open, sunny habitats. Water moderately during active growth, allowing for dry periods, and provide minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. A balanced, low-strength fertilizer may be applied sparingly in very poor soils, but high nitrogen fertilizers should generally be avoided.
