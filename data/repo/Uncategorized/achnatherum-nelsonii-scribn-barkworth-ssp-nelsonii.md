## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Intermountain West and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States and Canada. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Semi-arid Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, thriving in open, unshaded environments). |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent to moderate; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal supplemental water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Achnatherum is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It includes 20 species of needlegrass native to temperate Eurasia and North Africa. Several needlegrass species have been switched between Achnatherum and genus Stipa; taxonomy between the two closely related genera is still uncertain. In 2019 Peterson et al. reorganized the genera in tribe Stipeae based on molecular DNA studies, and placed the species from the Americas into other genera.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Columbia Needlegrass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its native temperate grasslands and semi-arid shrublands. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent to moderate watering once established, with minimal to no fertilizer needs to maintain its natural vigor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically not needed in average garden soils. If growth is poor, a very light, balanced granular fertilizer can be applied once annually in spring.
