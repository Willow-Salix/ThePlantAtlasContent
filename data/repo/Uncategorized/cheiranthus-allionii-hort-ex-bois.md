## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Asia (specifically regions of Siberia and Kazakhstan) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers full sun for best flowering and growth, reflecting its exposure in open steppe environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering until established, then it is drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out between waterings, typical for plants from regions with seasonal dry spells and well-drained soils. |

## 🌱 Overview
Erysimum, or wallflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the cabbage family, Brassicaceae. It includes more than 150 species, both popular garden plants and many wild forms. Erysimum is characterised by star-shaped (and/or two-sided) trichomes growing from the stem, with yellow, red, pink or orange flowers and multiseeded seed pods.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Siberian Wallflower thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native temperate steppe habitat. It requires moderate watering until established, becoming quite drought-tolerant, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; over-fertilizing can reduce flowering. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, consistent with plants adapted to naturally lean soils.
