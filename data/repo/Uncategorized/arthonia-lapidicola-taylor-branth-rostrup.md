## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Dot Lichen, provide bright, exposed conditions, mimicking its natural growth on rocks. Ensure regular wetting from rain or humidity followed by periods of drying, avoiding stagnant moisture. No external fertilization is needed, as it naturally acquires all necessary nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required, as lichens absorb nutrients directly from the atmosphere and substrate. Fertilizers can be detrimental to their growth.
