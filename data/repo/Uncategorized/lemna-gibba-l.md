## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Primarily Eurasia and Africa, now widely naturalized globally across temperate to subtropical regions. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Freshwater Aquatic Biome |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. As a surface-floating aquatic plant, it is exposed to direct light but can tolerate some shading from taller emergent vegetation or surrounding trees. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires continuous submersion in still or slow-moving freshwater. The water level must always be maintained to cover the plant entirely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lemna is a genus of free-floating aquatic plants referred to by the common name "duckweed". They are morphologically divergent members of the arum family Araceae. These rapidly growing plants have found uses as a model system for studies in community ecology, basic plant biology, ecotoxicology, and production of biopharmaceuticals, and as a source of animal feeds for agriculture and aquaculture. Currently, 14 species of Lemna are recognised.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Swollen Duckweed thrives when continuously submerged in still or slow-moving freshwater, ideally with exposure to full sun to partial shade. It requires a nutrient-rich aquatic environment, efficiently absorbing available nutrients from the water. Maintain stable water conditions and adequate nutrient levels for robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
High nutrient levels in the water column are preferred. It thrives in eutrophic (nutrient-rich) conditions, rapidly absorbing dissolved nitrogen, phosphorus, and other micronutrients.
