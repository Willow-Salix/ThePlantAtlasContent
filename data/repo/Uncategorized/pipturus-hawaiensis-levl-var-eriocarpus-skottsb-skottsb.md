## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands, USA (endemic) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Moist to Wet Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers filtered light to partial shade, mimicking its understory or forest edge habitat. Can tolerate some morning sun but should be protected from harsh, direct afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture, typical of wet forest environments. Water regularly, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent waterlogging while maintaining humidity. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pipturus albidus, known as māmaki (sometimes waimea, for its resemblance to olomea) in Hawaiian and known as Waimea pipturus in English, is a species of flowering plant in the nettle family, Urticaceae, that is endemic to Hawaiʻi. It inhabits coastal mesic, mixed mesic, and wet forests at elevations of 60–1,830 m (200–6,000 ft). Māmaki is a small tree that reaches a height of 9 m (30 ft) and a trunk diameter of 0.3 m (0.98 ft).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian native thrives in conditions that emulate its tropical moist to wet forest home. Provide filtered to partial shade and ensure consistently moist soil, allowing slight drying between waterings. Fertilize sparingly during warmer months for best health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer applied every 4-6 weeks during its active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
