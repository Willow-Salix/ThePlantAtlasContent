## 🧤 Care Instructions
Megalospora versicolor, a tropical crustose lichen, thrives in high humidity and partial shade, typical of rainforest environments. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere, thus requiring consistent ambient moisture rather than traditional watering or fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilization. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air, rainwater, and the substrate they colonize.
