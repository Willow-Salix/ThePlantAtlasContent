## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Lotus lancerottensis, replicate its arid native conditions by providing full sun and allowing long dry periods between waterings. This drought-tolerant plant thrives in poor, well-draining soils with minimal fertilization, especially avoiding high nitrogen feeds.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to very low fertilizer needs. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it can fix nitrogen. An annual light feeding with a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer during the active growing season is sufficient, or none at all if soil is adequately rich.
