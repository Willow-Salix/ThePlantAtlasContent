## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Oglethorpe oak requires full sun to partial shade and consistently moist conditions, mirroring its native humid subtropical bottomland habitat. It tolerates varying soil drainage and benefits from moderate fertilization to ensure robust growth, particularly during its establishment phase.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilizer. Native soils are often rich in organic matter; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can support young trees or those in less fertile sites.
