## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Humid oceanic temperate regions, including Western Europe (e.g., British Isles, Atlantic coast), Macaronesia (Azores, Madeira), and the Pacific Northwest of North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Oceanic Temperate Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate indirect light; thrives in dappled or partial shade, avoiding direct sun which can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires very high atmospheric humidity and consistent moisture, often from fog, rain, or dew. If cultivated, frequent misting is crucial to maintain hydration; does not require traditional soil watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sticta is a genus of lichens in the family Peltigeraceae. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in tropical areas, and includes about 114 species. These lichens have a leafy appearance, and are colored brown or black. Sticta species with cyanobacteria as photobionts can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, and due to their relative abundance and high turnover, they contribute appreciably to the rainforest ecosystem. They are commonly called spotted felt lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Spotted Felt Lichen thrives in consistently high humidity and low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native oceanic temperate forest habitat. It obtains moisture and nutrients from the air and substrate, requiring no traditional watering or fertilization, but benefits greatly from regular misting in cultivation to maintain its hydrated state.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; obtains all necessary nutrients from the air and its substrate (bark or rock). Traditional fertilizers are not needed and can be harmful.
