## 🧤 Care Instructions
Acacia saliciformis thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, characteristic of its native Australian dry woodlands. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. As a leguminous plant, it fixes nitrogen. If necessary, use a slow-release, low-phosphorus native plant fertilizer very sparingly during the growing season.
