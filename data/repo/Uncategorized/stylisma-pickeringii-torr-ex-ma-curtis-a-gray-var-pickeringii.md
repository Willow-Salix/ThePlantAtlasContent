| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and Southeastern United States (e.g., New Jersey, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Pine Barrens and Dry Sandhills |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Thrives in very well-drained, sandy soils and is highly drought-tolerant. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant perennial thrives in full sun and very well-drained, sandy soils, characteristic of its pine barren native habitat. It requires minimal watering once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and prefers nutrient-poor conditions, making heavy fertilization unnecessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, using a low-dose, balanced fertilizer primarily during establishment or if signs of nutrient deficiency appear.
