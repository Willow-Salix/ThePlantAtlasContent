## 🧤 Care Instructions
Demetri's Milkvetch thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate montane steppe, requiring full sun and very well-draining soil. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and use fertilizer sparingly due to its natural nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; as a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen and prefers lean soils. Minimal or no fertilization is needed, avoiding high-nitrogen formulas.
