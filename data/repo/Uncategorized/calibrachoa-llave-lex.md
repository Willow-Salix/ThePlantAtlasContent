## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Brazil, Uruguay, and Northeastern Argentina |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Grasslands and Rocky Slopes |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal flowering, tolerating partial sun in very hot climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering, allowing the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. They are accustomed to periods of moisture followed by drier spells, but do not tolerate soggy conditions; excellent drainage is crucial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Calibrachoa is a genus of plants in the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. They are evergreen short-lived perennials and subshrubs with a sprawling habit, with small petunia-type flowers. They are found across much the same region of South America as petunias, from southern Brazil across to Peru and Chile, inhabiting scrub and open grassland.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Calibrachoas thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting their native open, sunny habitats on rocky slopes. They prefer consistent moisture, especially during bloom, but require excellent drainage to prevent root issues. Regular feeding supports their vigorous growth and continuous flowering throughout the season.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to heavy feeders during their active growth and blooming periods. Fertilize every 2-4 weeks with a balanced liquid fertilizer or use a slow-release granular fertilizer at planting.
