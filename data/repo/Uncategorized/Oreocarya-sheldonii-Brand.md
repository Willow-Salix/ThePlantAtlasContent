## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Grassland / Semi-Arid Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic natural rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Oreocarya (perennial cat's-eye) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. There are about 63 species and its native range extends from western and central Canada, through western United States to north Mexico. It is part of subtribe of Amsinckiinae.
It was once thought to be a either a subgenus or synonym of Cryptantha Lehm. ex G. Don, as they both had plenty of tiny flowers, hairy leaves, and persisting dried flower stems.
Botanist William Alfred Weber later noted that the 2 genera were different in form as Oreocarya was a "biennial or perennial from rosettes of basal leaves; flowers more than 5 mm in diameter, often distinctly long-tubular with prominent yellow eye", while Cryptantha was an "annual without rosettes of basal leaves; flowers minute, less than 5 mm diameter, short-tubed with inconspicuous eye".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sheldon's Oreocarya thrives in full sun conditions, replicating its native open, arid environments. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering with excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Fertilizer should be applied sparingly, if at all, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. If necessary, a single light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring is sufficient.
