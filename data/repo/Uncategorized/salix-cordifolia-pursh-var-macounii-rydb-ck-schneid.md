| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America (Canada: Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan; United States: Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Boreal Wetland / Cool Temperate Wetland (Fens, marshes, streambanks) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, favoring full sun in its natural open habitats for optimal growth. |
| **💧 Water** | High water requirements; consistently moist to wet soil. This plant does not tolerate drought and requires constant moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Macoun's Willow thrives in consistently wet to moist soil and prefers full sun exposure. To mimic its native fen and streambank habitat, ensure high soil moisture levels and bright light conditions to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; native fen and marsh soils are typically organic-rich but also receive mineral input, indicating a need for moderate nutrient levels.
