## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Specific native origin cannot be definitively determined for a plant identified by a misapplied name ('auct. non'). The true Euphrasia tatarica (often considered a synonym of Euphrasia pectinata) is generally found in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and parts of Russia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Specific native climate cannot be definitively determined for a plant identified by a misapplied name. The true Euphrasia tatarica typically inhabits temperate grasslands, steppes, and meadows, characterized by distinct seasons. |
| **☀️ Light** | Cannot be definitively extrapolated for this specific misidentified plant. However, most species within the genus Euphrasia, particularly those found in open temperate habitats, generally require full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Cannot be definitively extrapolated for this specific misidentified plant. Eyebright species generally prefer consistently moist, but well-drained soils, reflecting their natural habitats in meadows and open fields with moderate rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Euphrasia, or eyebright, is a genus of about 215 species of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae (formerly included in the Scrophulariaceae), with a cosmopolitan distribution. They are hemiparasitic on grasses and other plants. Both the common and generic names refer to the plant's use in a lotion for treating eye infections, with Euphrasia literally meaning 'good-cheer'.
Many species are found in alpine or sub-alpine meadows where snow is common. Flowers usually are borne terminally, are zygomorphic, and have a lower petal shaped like a lip. The most common flower colours are purple, blue-white, and violet. Some species have yellow markings on the lower petal to act as a guide to pollinating insects.
Alternative names, mainly in herbalism, are Augentrostkraut, Euphrasiae herba, Herba Euphrasiae and Herbe d'Euphraise.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Due to the scientific name 'Euphrasia tatarica auct. non Fisch. ex Spreng.' indicating a misapplication, specific care for this plant cannot be precisely determined. General care for Eyebright species involves providing full sun to partial shade, maintaining consistently moist but well-drained soil, and understanding their semi-parasitic nature which means they derive nutrients from host plants rather than requiring heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Cannot be definitively extrapolated for this specific misidentified plant. Euphrasia species are semi-parasitic on the roots of grasses and other plants, obtaining some nutrients from their hosts. They typically do not require rich soils and excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
