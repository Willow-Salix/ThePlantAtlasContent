## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in consistently moist, humid environments, preferring low to partial indirect light and protection from direct sun. Ensure high ambient humidity and frequent moisture through misting or natural rainfall, but avoid waterlogging. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it absorbs nutrients from the air and its substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; derives nutrients primarily from the air, rainwater, and its substrate.
