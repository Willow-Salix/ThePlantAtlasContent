| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically subalpine and alpine regions of the Rocky Mountains and Cascade Range. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Meadow, characterized by cold, snowy winters and cool, moist summers. Soils are typically rocky and well-drained. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in bright conditions, tolerating the intense light found at higher altitudes. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage, mimicking the rapid drainage of mountain soils. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arnica  is a genus of perennial, herbaceous plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). The genus name Arnica may be derived from the Greek arni, "lamb", in reference to the plants' soft, hairy leaves. Arnica is also known by the names mountain tobacco and, confusingly, leopard's bane and wolfsbane—two names that it shares with the entirely unrelated genus Aconitum.
This circumboreal and montane (subalpine) genus occurs mostly in the temperate regions of western North America, with a few species native to the Arctic regions of northern Eurasia and North America.
Arnica species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Bucculatrix arnicella.
Arnica was previously classified in the tribe Senecioneae because it has a flower or pappus of fine bristles.
Arnica is the basis of a homeopathic remedy promoted for aiding bruise recovery.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Smallhead Arnica, provide a location with full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil is well-drained and rocky, mimicking its native alpine habitat. Water moderately to keep the soil moist but never waterlogged, allowing for natural drainage. Minimal fertilization is needed as it thrives in lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to lean, rocky soils; over-fertilization can reduce flowering. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring, or none at all, is usually sufficient.
