## 🧤 Care Instructions
Woodland Pinkroot flourishes in a shady, moist environment, mirroring its native temperate woodland floor. Ensure the soil remains consistently damp but well-drained and enrich it with organic matter. Protect it from intense direct sunlight to prevent leaf scorch.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from organically rich soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or regular amendment with compost, is sufficient.
