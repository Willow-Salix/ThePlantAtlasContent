## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of Asia (e.g., India, China, Southeast Asia, Japan), Australia, and parts of Oceania and Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical, often experiencing monsoon climates with distinct wet and dry seasons, ranging from moist forests to open grasslands and coastal areas. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to full sun, depending on the specific species and its native habitat; generally, more sun is tolerated with adequate watering. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during the active growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce frequency significantly during cooler, dormant periods to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cycads —constituting the division Cycadophyta—are seed plants with a stout, woody cylindrical trunk with a crown of large, hard, stiff, evergreen and usually pinnate (feather-shaped) leaves. The species are dioecious, that is, individual plants of a species are either male or female. Cycads vary in size from having trunks only a few centimeters to several meters tall. They typically grow slowly and have long lifespans. They superficially resemble palms or ferns, but are not closely related to either group. Cycads are gymnosperms. Cycads have specialized pollinators, usually a specific beetle, and more rarely a thrips or a moth.
Both male and female cycads bear cones (strobili) containing their seeds, somewhat resembling conifer cones. Cycads fix nitrogen in association with cyanobacteria living in the plants' roots. Some species are used as narcotics, while in Vanuatu the plant symbolizes peace and appears on the national flag. Cycads all over the world are in decline, with four species on the brink of extinction and seven species each with fewer than 100 plants left in the wild.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cycads thrive in bright light and well-draining soil, requiring regular watering during their growing season with a dry period between. They benefit from light fertilization during active growth and protection from frost, which is crucial for most species.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer formulated for palms or cycads.
