## 🧤 Care Instructions
This is a tropical lichen, not a vascular plant, requiring specialized care. It thrives in exceptionally high humidity and indirect light, mimicking its native rainforest habitat. Avoid direct sun and traditional soil-based watering or fertilization, focusing instead on atmospheric moisture.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens do not require traditional fertilization and may be harmed by it. They obtain nutrients from the air, rain, and their substrate.
