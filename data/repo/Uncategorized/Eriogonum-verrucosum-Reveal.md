## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Endemic to California, primarily found in the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts, Transverse Ranges, and Peninsular Ranges of Southern California, United States. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun; requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflecting its open desert and chaparral habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Very infrequent watering; highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring deep watering only during prolonged dry spells mimicking sparse desert rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Graceful Buckwheat thrives in full sun and well-draining, nutrient-poor soil, indicative of its native arid scrubland habitat. It is extremely drought-tolerant and requires very little watering or fertilization, making overwatering the primary concern.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy, or rocky soils typical of arid environments, and can be harmed by excessive nutrients.
