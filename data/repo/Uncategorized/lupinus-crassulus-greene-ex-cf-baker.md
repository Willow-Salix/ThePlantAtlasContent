## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (specifically Tehachapi Mountains, Southern Sierra Nevada, and Transverse Ranges) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Woodland (Montane) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), consistent with its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its native hot, dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tehachapi Lupine requires full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean montane environment. Water sparingly once established, allowing dry periods, and refrain from using high-nitrogen fertilizers due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nitrogen; as a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. Avoid high nitrogen fertilizers, which can inhibit flowering. Thrives in moderate to poor, well-drained soils.
