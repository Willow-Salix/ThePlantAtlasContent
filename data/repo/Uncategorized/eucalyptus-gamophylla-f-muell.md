## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern Australia (Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-Arid Savanna |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflective of its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Highly drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply and infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during drier periods. It can tolerate more water during its active growth phases, mimicking its native wet season. |

## 🌱 Overview
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Twin-leaf Mallee, provide full sun exposure and practice infrequent, deep watering once it is established, mimicking its native semi-arid savanna climate. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, so fertilization should be minimal and with a low-phosphorus formula if necessary. Ensuring good drainage is also crucial for its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Adaptable to nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its native environment. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, using a low-phosphorus native plant fertilizer only if growth appears significantly stunted, primarily during its growing season.
