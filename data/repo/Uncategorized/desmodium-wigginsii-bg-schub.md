## 🌱 Overview
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Andean native thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical montane forest home. Provide bright indirect light to partial sun and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil. Fertilize lightly during the growing season to support its vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season (e.g., once a month). As a legume, it may have reduced nitrogen needs due to nitrogen fixation.
