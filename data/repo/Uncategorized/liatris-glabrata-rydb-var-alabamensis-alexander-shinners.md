| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States, specifically Alabama |

| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) reflecting its native habitat in open, exposed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, ensuring consistent moisture during dry periods, especially while establishing. It tolerates some drought once mature but requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Alabama Blazing Star thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its native open glades. It requires moderate watering, tolerating some drought once established, but benefits from consistent moisture during dry spells. Minimal fertilization is needed to ensure healthy, sturdy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. This plant thrives in average to poor soils and over-fertilization can lead to weak, leggy growth. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring if soil is exceptionally poor.
