## 🧤 Care Instructions
Buckbrush is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub perfectly suited for full sun exposure and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. Once established, it requires minimal to no watering and no fertilization, as excess nutrients can be harmful.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Avoid high phosphorus fertilizers, which can be detrimental.
