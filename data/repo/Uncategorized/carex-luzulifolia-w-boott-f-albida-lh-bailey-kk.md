## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This sedge thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded environments, reflecting its native forest understory habitat. Ensure the soil never dries out completely and protect it from harsh direct sunlight to promote lush growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, slow-release or liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring/early summer). Native soils are often moderately rich from decaying organic matter.
