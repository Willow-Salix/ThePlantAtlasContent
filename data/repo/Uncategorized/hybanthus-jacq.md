## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Broadly distributed across tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Forest Understory and Woodlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade; direct, intense sunlight should be avoided as it can scorch foliage. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist, well-draining soil is essential. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hybanthus (green-violet) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Violaceae. This genus name is Greek for "humpback flower", referring to the drooping pedicels of plants that are part of this genus. The genus is grossly polyphyletic and may contain up to nine different genera, of which Pombalia Vand., Cubelium Raf. and Pigea DC. have been previously recognised.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Greenviolets, characteristic of forest understories, thrive in conditions that mimic their native shaded and humid habitats. Provide consistent moisture to well-draining soil and shield them from direct, harsh sunlight. Fertilize sparingly with an organic-rich solution to support robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to low fertilization. A balanced, organic-rich fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season, mimicking the nutrient recycling of forest floors.
