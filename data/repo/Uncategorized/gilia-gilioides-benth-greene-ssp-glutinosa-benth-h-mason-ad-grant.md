## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California (USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Arid Scrubland/Chaparral) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **💧 Water** | Very low; drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during warm, dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sticky Gilia thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean chaparral habitat in California. It requires very low watering once established, tolerating drought conditions typical of its summer-dry climate. Fertilization is generally not necessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Native soils are typically lean; over-fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental. If desired, a very light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring.
