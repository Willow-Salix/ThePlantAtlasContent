## 🌱 Overview
Buelliella is a genus of lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) fungi in the family Stictographaceae. It comprises 13 thirteen species. The genus was established in 1935 by the American lichenologist Bruce Fink, who originally included seven species. These fungi are parasites that live on other lichens, producing small disc-shaped fruiting bodies that start buried in their host and later emerge at the surface.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a lichenicolous fungus, Buelliella nuttallii's survival depends on the presence of its specific host lichen (e.g., Buellia nuttallii) in a suitable Mediterranean-type environment. It requires conditions suitable for its host, including sun exposure and natural cycles of wet and dry periods for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; as a lichenicolous fungus, it obtains nutrients from its host lichen and the environment, not requiring traditional fertilization.
