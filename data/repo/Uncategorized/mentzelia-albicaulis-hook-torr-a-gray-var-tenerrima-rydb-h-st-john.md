## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires very little water, tolerating severe drought conditions. Ensure well-draining soil and avoid over-fertilization to mimic its native arid habitat, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. If grown in poor soil, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial.
