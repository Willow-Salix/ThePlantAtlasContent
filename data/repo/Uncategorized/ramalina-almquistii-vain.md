## 🧤 Care Instructions
Almquist's Cartilage Lichen thrives in cold, open Arctic environments, requiring high sun exposure during its active periods while tolerating very low temperatures. It needs minimal direct watering, preferring high atmospheric humidity and long periods of dryness, and obtains all necessary nutrients from the air and its growth substrate, making fertilization unnecessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens are self-sufficient, obtaining all necessary nutrients from the air and the substrate they grow on, not from soil or added fertilizers.
