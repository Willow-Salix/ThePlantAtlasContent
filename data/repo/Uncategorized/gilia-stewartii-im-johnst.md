## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Galápagos Islands (Floreana Island) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-arid Tropical |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. Requires high light exposure, typical of open scrubland environments with little overhead canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant. Prefers infrequent but deep watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Significantly reduce water during any dormant or dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stewart's Gilia thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its native Galápagos arid scrubland habitat. It requires excellent drainage and is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent, deep watering. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to naturally nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to naturally poor or rocky soils; over-fertilization can be detrimental. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, during its active growing season.
