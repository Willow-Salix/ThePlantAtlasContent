## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lily thrives in conditions mimicking its native dry, open environments. Provide full sun and very well-drained soil, watering moderately during its active winter/spring growth cycle and keeping it dry during its summer dormancy. Fertilize sparingly in spring, if at all.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils; a very light application of balanced fertilizer during early spring growth is sufficient, but often not necessary.
