## 🌱 Overview
Achillea  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The plants typically have frilly leaves and are known colloquially as yarrows, although this common name usually refers to A. millefolium. The genus was named after the Greek mythological character Achilles, whose soldiers were said to have used yarrow to treat their wounds; this is reflected by common names such as allheal and bloodwort. The genus is native primarily to Eurasia and North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This variety of yarrow thrives in full sun and well-drained, average to poor soils, reflecting its native temperate montane and grassland habitats in Western North America. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering, and has low fertilizer needs, preferring leaner conditions over rich ones.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to average soils. Excessive fertilization can promote leggy growth and reduce flowering. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring if soil is very poor, but generally not needed.
