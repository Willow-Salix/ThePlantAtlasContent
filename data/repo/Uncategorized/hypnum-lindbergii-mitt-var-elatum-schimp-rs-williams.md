## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lindberg's Feather Moss thrives in cool, shaded, and consistently moist environments, much like its native boreal wetlands and forest floors. Provide high humidity and avoid direct sunlight and rich fertilizers, as it is adapted to low-nutrient conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. Mosses are adapted to nutrient-poor environments and can be sensitive to excessive nutrients.
