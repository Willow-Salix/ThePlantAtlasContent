## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western and Central Europe, including the British Isles, France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, and Scandinavia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Oceanic Climate, typically found in microhabitats of shaded, moist calcareous rock surfaces. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate indirect light. Thrives in shaded or semi-shaded positions; direct, intense sunlight can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and periodic wetting from rainfall or mist. As a lichen, it absorbs moisture directly from the environment and does not require conventional watering or soil moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecania is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. Lecania is widely distributed, especially in temperate regions, and contains about 65 species. These lichens form thin, crusty growths on various surfaces and produce small disc-shaped fruiting bodies that are typically brown to black in colour. Most species reproduce both sexually through spores and asexually through tiny reproductive structures, allowing them to spread effectively in their environments.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in humid, temperate oceanic conditions, specifically on shaded, moist calcareous rocks. Maintain high ambient humidity and protect from direct sun and prolonged dryness. No conventional watering or fertilization is needed, as it absorbs nutrients and moisture from the environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization is required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients directly from airborne particles and precipitation, not through a root system or soil.
