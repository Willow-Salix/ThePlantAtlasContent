## 🧤 Care Instructions
Snow lichen thrives in the high light conditions of alpine and arctic tundras, often near snowmelt. It requires consistent moisture during active growth but is well-adapted to periods of dryness or freezing. Nutrient needs are extremely low, reflecting its native, impoverished environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low; requires minimal to no supplemental fertilizer as native environments are nutrient-poor.
