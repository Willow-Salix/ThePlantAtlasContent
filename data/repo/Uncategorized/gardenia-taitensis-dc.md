## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Tahitian Gardenia thrives in warm, humid conditions typical of its native Pacific island home. Provide bright, indirect light, consistent moisture, and regular feeding with an acid-loving fertilizer during active growth. Ensure high humidity to prevent leaf issues and support its fragrant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding during the growing season with a balanced, acid-loving fertilizer. Native soils in its range can vary, but consistent nutrient supply supports robust growth in a high-rainfall climate.
