## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Chihuahuan Desert environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly, and provide minimal fertilization, especially avoiding high nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen is not needed. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring, or none if planted in naturally rich soil, is sufficient.
