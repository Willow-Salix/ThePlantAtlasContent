## 🌱 Overview
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bryum Moss thrives in temperate conditions with consistent moisture and bright, indirect light to partial shade. Ensure excellent drainage and high humidity, while avoiding direct, harsh sunlight and excessive fertilization, which can harm these delicate plants.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses are not heavy feeders and excessive nutrients can be detrimental. A very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied extremely sparingly if desired, but is generally unnecessary.
