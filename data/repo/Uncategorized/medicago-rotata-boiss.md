## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern Mediterranean (Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Palestine) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its open habitat in its native range. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water moderately during its active growing season (typically winter/spring), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Significantly reduce or cease watering during hot, dry summer dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Medicago rotata is a species of flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is found throughout the eastern Mediterranean from Turkey to Israel. It forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Sinorhizobium medicae, which is capable of nitrogen fixation.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Mediterranean plant thrives in full sun and is well-adapted to drought, requiring infrequent watering during its active growth and very little during summer dormancy. It needs minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, preferring well-drained soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and can thrive in relatively poor to moderately fertile soils. If necessary, a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer can be applied very sparingly in early spring.
