## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including parts of Canada (British Columbia), the western United States (e.g., California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico), and northern Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate coniferous and mixed forests, often in cool, moist, shaded understory environments. |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low light to deep shade. This plant is mycoheterotrophic and does not photosynthesize, thriving in the dim light conditions of a dense forest understory. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist, but well-drained soil during its active growth period. It requires the humid conditions typical of a forest floor, but is intolerant of waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Corallorhiza striata is a species of orchid known by the common names striped coralroot and hooded coralroot. This flowering plant is widespread across much of southern Canada, the northern and western United States, and Mexico.  It lives in dry, decaying plant matter on the ground in pine and mixed coniferous forests, and it obtains its nutrients from fungi via mycoheterotrophy.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Due to its complex mycoheterotrophic lifestyle, this orchid is virtually impossible to cultivate outside of its specific native habitat. Successful 'care' would entail recreating its cool, consistently moist, deeply shaded forest floor environment and, most critically, the specific symbiotic fungal associations it depends on for survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable in a traditional sense. This plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it obtains all its nutrients from fungi associated with decaying organic matter and tree roots. Traditional fertilizers would be ineffective and potentially harmful.
