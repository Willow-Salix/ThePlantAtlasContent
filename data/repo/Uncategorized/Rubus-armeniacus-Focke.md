## 🌱 Overview
Rubus armeniacus, the Himalayan blackberry or Armenian blackberry, is a species of Rubus in the blackberry group Rubus subgenus Rubus series Discolores (P.J. Müll.) Focke. It is native to Armenia and northern Iran, and widely invasive elsewhere. Both its scientific name and origin have been the subject of much confusion.
The plant is known for its highly edible berries (technically aggregate fruits), which are large and sweet when ripe. Notably, the species was used in the development of the marionberry. Also known for its extreme vigor and tendency to spread rapidly over disturbed areas, it is considered a noxious weed and an invasive species in many regions.
