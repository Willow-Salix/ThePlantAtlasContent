## 🌱 Overview
Chrysopsis (golden asters) are plants in the family Asteraceae native to the southern and eastern United States. All the species are found in Florida, although some are found in other states as well.
These are annual and perennial herbs bearing daisy-like flower heads with yellow disc florets and usually yellow ray florets. Some species formerly classified in this genus are now included in other genera: Heterotheca, Pityopsis, Stenotus, Ionactis, Aster, Eucephalus, Erigeron, Machaeranthera, Croptilon, Xanthisma, Oclemena, Bradburia, Oxypappus, Arnica, and Helichrysopsis.
Golden asters are often used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Schinia petulans (which feeds exclusively on C. subulata).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, open locations with well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its native pineland habitat. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, along with low fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to average soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth is poor, but often not necessary.
