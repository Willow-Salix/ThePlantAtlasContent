## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Caribbean islands (e.g., Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Jamaica) and tropical Americas (e.g., Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving with bright direct light for optimal growth, similar to its exposure in forest edges or open disturbed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering is essential during the active growing season to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, allowing the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce frequency during cooler or less active periods, reflecting its native dry season. |

## 🌱 Overview
Abutilon  is a large genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia. General common names include Indian mallow and velvetleaf; ornamental varieties may be known as room maple, parlor maple, or flowering maple.
The genus name is an 18th-century Neo-Latin word that came from the Arabic ’abū-ṭīlūn (أبو طيلون),  the name given by Avicenna to this or a similar genus.
The type species is Abutilon theophrasti. Several species formerly placed in Abutilon, including the cultivated species and hybrids commonly known as "flowering maples", have recently (2012, 2014) been transferred to the new genus Callianthe.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical plant thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring consistent moisture during its active growth phases, allowing for slight drying between waterings. Fertilize moderately during spring and summer to support its vigorous growth, providing conditions that mimic its native warm, seasonally moist tropical dry forest environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer. This supports vigorous growth in potentially less nutrient-rich tropical soils.
