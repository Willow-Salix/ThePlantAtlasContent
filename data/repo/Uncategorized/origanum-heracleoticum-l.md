## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean region, particularly Greece, Southeastern Europe, and Western Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its native open, sun-drenched habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly during cooler, dormant periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Oregano (US: , UK: ; Origanum vulgare) is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It was native to the Mediterranean region, but widely naturalised elsewhere in the temperate Northern Hemisphere.
Oregano is a woody perennial plant, growing to 90 cm (35 in) tall, with opposite leaves 1–4 cm (1⁄2–1+1⁄2 in) long. The flowers which can be white, pink or light purple, are 3–4 mm (1⁄8–3⁄16 in) long, and produced in erect spikes in summer. It is sometimes called wild marjoram, while its close relative O. majorana is known as sweet marjoram. Both are widely used as culinary herbs, especially in Turkish, Greek, Spanish, Italian, Latin, and French cuisine. Oregano is also an ornamental plant, with numerous cultivars bred for varying leaf colour, flower colour and habit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Greek Oregano requires full sun and well-drained soil to mimic its native Mediterranean conditions. It is drought-tolerant and prefers infrequent watering, thriving on a 'less is more' approach. Avoid over-fertilizing to maintain its characteristic strong flavor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils; excessive fertilization can reduce flavor. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich soil.
