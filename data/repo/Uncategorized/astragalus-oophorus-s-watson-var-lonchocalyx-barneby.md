## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soil, mimicking its arid habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization. Ensure good air circulation and mimic drought conditions for optimal health.
