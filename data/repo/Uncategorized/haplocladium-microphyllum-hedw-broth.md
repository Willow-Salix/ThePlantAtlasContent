# Haplocladium microphyllum
### *Haplocladium microphyllum (Hedw.) Broth.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and tropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate to Tropical Forest Understory |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to partial light, preferring deep shade or filtered light conditions similar to a forest floor. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture and high humidity are crucial; the substrate should remain moist but not waterlogged. Regular misting or placement in a terrarium is beneficial. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in consistently moist, humid environments with very low to partial light, mimicking its natural forest understory habitat. Ensure the substrate never dries out completely and maintain high ambient humidity. Fertilization is generally not needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses derive sufficient nutrients from rainwater and decaying organic matter; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
