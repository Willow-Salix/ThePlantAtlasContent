## 🧤 Care Instructions
Twisted Lobelia, native to California's Mediterranean climate, thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-draining soil. Provide moderate water during its spring growth, allowing it to become drought-tolerant through dry summers. Fertilization should be minimal, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-lean native habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilizer requirements. It is adapted to lean or serpentine soils; a light, balanced feed once in spring is sufficient if growth is poor.
