## 🌱 Overview
Navarretia is a genus of flowering plants related to the phloxes and the gilias. This is one genus of plants, among others, which are sometimes called pincushion plants. It includes 45 species native to the Americas. In North America they range from western Canada through the western and west-central United States to northwestern Mexico, and to Ohio and Pennsylvania. In South America they range through Argentina and Chile.
The inflorescence which bears the flowers is surrounded by frilly green bracts bearing soft spines, giving it the appearance of a pincushion. Several species are members of the vernal pool ecosystem.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering during its active spring growth, then tolerates dry conditions as it's adapted to summer drought. Avoid over-fertilization, as it is accustomed to the lean soils found in its native chaparral and woodland habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils.
