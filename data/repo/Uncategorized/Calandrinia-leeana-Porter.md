| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Mountain/Subalpine |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers bright light, especially in cooler climates, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter regions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Calandrinia is a genus of flowering plants known as purslanes and redmaids. It includes 37 species of annual and perennial herbs which bear colorful flowers in shades of red to purple and white. Species of this genus are native to the Americas, including western and southern South America, Central America, and western North America. Some species have been introduced to parts of Australia, New Zealand, southern Africa, Asia, and Europe. Over 60 species native to Australia and New Guinea that were formerly included in Calandrinia are now placed in a separate genus, Rumicastrum or Parakeelya. A single eastern Australian species named in 2022, Calandrinia petrophila, is still included in Calandrinia, but will be placed into the Australian genus when the name of the new genus is finally settled.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This high-altitude plant thrives in bright light and well-draining, rocky soils. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings, and fertilize sparingly as it prefers leaner conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in leaner, rocky soils, so a balanced slow-release fertilizer applied once a season is usually sufficient, or even unnecessary in rich soils.
