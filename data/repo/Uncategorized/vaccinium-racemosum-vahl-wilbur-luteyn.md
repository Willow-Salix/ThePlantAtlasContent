| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil. Requires frequent watering and high ambient humidity, reflecting its native cloud forest environment with regular rainfall and condensation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Vaccinium  vack-SIN-ee-əm is a common and widespread genus of shrubs or dwarf shrubs in the heath family (Ericaceae). The fruits of many species are eaten by humans and some are of commercial importance, including the cranberry, blueberry, bilberry (whortleberry), lingonberry (cowberry), and huckleberry. Like many other heath plants, they are restricted to acidic soils.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Vaccinium racemosum, provide an environment that mimics its native tropical montane cloud forest. This involves consistently moist, well-drained, acidic soil and dappled to partial shade. Ensure high ambient humidity and protect the plant from drought and harsh, direct sunlight.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light application of an acidic, balanced fertilizer, especially during the growing season. Native soils are typically rich in organic matter, so a slow-release or organic acidic fertilizer is ideal.
