| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, including southeastern North America (e.g., Florida), Central and South America, Caribbean, parts of Africa and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Humid Forests (Rainforests) |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light; thrives in shaded conditions, typical of a forest understory or canopy interior. Avoid direct, harsh sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and frequent misting to simulate its native rainfall. Substrate (bark, leaves) should remain moist, but ensure good air circulation to prevent stagnation. Does not require traditional soil watering. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen flourishes in conditions mirroring its native tropical and subtropical humid forests, requiring high ambient humidity and low to medium indirect light. Consistent moisture through regular misting is crucial, while traditional watering and fertilization are generally not needed for its survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Lichens absorb nutrients directly from the atmosphere and rainwater; traditional fertilizers are generally unnecessary and can be harmful.
