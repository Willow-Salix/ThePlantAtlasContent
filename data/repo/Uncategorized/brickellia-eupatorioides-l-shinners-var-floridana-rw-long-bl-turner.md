## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Florida, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Humid (specifically often found in pine flatwoods, sandhills, and scrub habitats) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. In its native habitat, it grows in open areas or under the light canopy of pines, indicating a preference for bright light. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Thrives in consistently moist but well-drained soil, tolerating some dry periods once established, reflecting its native environment with seasonal rainfall but generally well-drained, sandy substrates. |

## 🌱 Overview
Brickellia is a North American genus of about 100 to 110 species of plants in the family Asteraceae, known commonly as brickellbushes. They are found in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central America.  Many species are native to the American southwest, especially Texas. Brickellia is among the more basal lineages of the Eupatorieae and should not be assigned to a subtribe pending further research.
They are mostly woody perennial shrubs. Some species have a very strong pleasant scent, while others smell distasteful. All contain high amounts of essential oils. Germacrene D, a natural insecticide, is found in B. veronicifolia and probably other species, if not all.
Despite their chemical defenses, brickellbushes are food for caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera. These include the noctuid moths Schinia trifascia, Schinia oleagina, which is known only from Brickellia, Schinia buta, which is only known from B. californica, and Schinia gracilenta, which is only known from B. eupatorioides.
The genus is named for John Brickell, 1748–1809, Irish-born physician and naturalist.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Florida native thrives in full to partial sun and requires well-drained soil with moderate moisture, especially during its growing season. It is adapted to lean soils, indicating a low need for fertilization, reflecting its resilience in its natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to the nutrient-poor, sandy soils typical of its Florida habitats, it does not require heavy fertilization.
