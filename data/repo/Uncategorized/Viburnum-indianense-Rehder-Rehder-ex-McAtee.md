## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Viburnum is native to moist, temperate to subtropical wetlands of eastern North America, requiring consistently wet or moist, organically rich soil. It thrives in conditions ranging from partial to full sun, benefiting from afternoon shade in warmer areas. Ensure ample water and enrich the soil with organic matter for optimal health and vigor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
