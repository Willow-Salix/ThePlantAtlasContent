## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bituminaria thrives in conditions mimicking its Mediterranean origin, requiring full sun and well-drained soil. It is very drought-tolerant once established, needing regular water only during its active growth period in spring. As a nitrogen-fixer, it has low fertilizer requirements.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, Bituminaria enriches the soil and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial if soil is very poor.
