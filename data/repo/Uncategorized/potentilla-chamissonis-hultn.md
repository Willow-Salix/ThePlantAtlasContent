## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Subarctic and Arctic regions, including Alaska (USA), Yukon and Northwest Territories (Canada), Greenland, and Eastern Siberia (Russia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subarctic |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. This plant thrives in bright, direct light for several hours a day, reflecting its exposure in open tundra and rocky alpine environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate and consistent moisture, particularly during the growing season. While its native soils can be moist, excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot, as waterlogging is detrimental. Avoid prolonged drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cold-hardy plant flourishes in full to partial sun with consistently moist yet exceptionally well-drained soil, mirroring its native alpine tundra habitat. It demands minimal fertilization, preferring nutrient-poor conditions. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot and promote healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This species is adapted to nutrient-poor soils characteristic of alpine and tundra environments. Fertilize sparingly with a very diluted, balanced fertilizer, or generally avoid fertilizing, especially in rich garden soils.
