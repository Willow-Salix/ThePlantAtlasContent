## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in temperate and boreal forest regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate to Boreal Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade; thrives in indirect or filtered light, as direct sun can cause desiccation and damage. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high humidity and frequent moisture exposure, typical of damp forest environments. Absorbs water from mist, rain, and ambient humidity; avoid prolonged dryness. |

## 🌱 Overview
Leptogium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Collemataceae. It has about 110 species. Species formerly classified under Leptogium have since been divided among the genera Leptogium, Pseudoleptogium, and Scytinium. Leptogium lichens are predominantly found on tree bark or soil, often among mosses, and sometimes on rocks in moist environments.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Saturn skin lichen, provide a cool, consistently humid environment with filtered or indirect light, mimicking its native forest habitat. Ensure regular moisture through misting or high ambient humidity, and strictly avoid direct sun or any form of fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is needed or recommended. Lichens derive necessary nutrients from air and the substrate, and are sensitive to added chemicals.
