# Oahu Pilo Kea
### *Platydesma cornuta Hillebr.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Oahu, Hawaiian Islands |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers partial shade to dappled sunlight, as it naturally grows in the understory of wet forests, avoiding direct, harsh afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil. Water frequently, ensuring the soil does not dry out completely, mimicking the high rainfall of its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Platydesma is a formerly recognized genus of plants in family Rutaceae. Evidence from 2009 indicated that Platydesma is nested within the genus Melicope and is sister to all Hawaiian Melicope species, and it is now placed within that genus. The other Melicope species are dioecious (individual plants only bear either male or female flowers), whereas the flowers of species formerly placed in Platydesma are hermaphroditic, suggesting a rare evolutionary reversion away from dioecy.
Species included:

Platydesma remyi → Melicope remyi
Platydesma rostrata → Melicope rostrata

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To successfully cultivate Oahu Pilo Kea, replicate its native tropical wet forest environment by providing consistent moisture, high humidity, and dappled sunlight. Avoid direct sun exposure and apply fertilizer sparingly to support its growth without overwhelming it.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
A balanced, slow-release or diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season; native forest soils provide organic nutrients but can be sensitive to strong chemical fertilizers.
