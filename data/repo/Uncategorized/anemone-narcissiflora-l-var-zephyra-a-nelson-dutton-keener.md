## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Rocky Mountains, North America (western United States and Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade (prefers full sun in cooler alpine climates, may benefit from afternoon shade in hotter regions) |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil during the growing season, but excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot, mimicking its native well-drained, rocky slopes. |

## 🌱 Overview
Anemone () is a genus of flowering plants in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae. Plants of the genus are commonly called windflowers. They are native to the temperate and subtropical regions of all regions except Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, Narcissus Anemone requires conditions similar to its alpine home: full sun, consistently moist but extremely well-draining soil, and cool temperatures. Avoid heavy, waterlogged soils and excessive fertilization. This plant is best suited for rock gardens or alpine beds.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from minimal fertilization in spring as it is adapted to nutrient-poor alpine soils.
