# Adobe Popcornflower
### *Allocarya granulata Piper*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (California, Oregon, USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Seasonal Wetlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring direct and unobstructed sunlight for most of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires prolonged periods of standing water or very saturated soil during its active growth phase (winter/spring), followed by a complete drying out period in summer. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun with a very specific watering regimen: extensive flooding or saturation during cooler months, followed by a dry dormancy through summer. It prefers lean soils and requires minimal to no fertilization, mimicking its native vernal pool habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needs; thrives in naturally lean, often heavy clay or hardpan soils typical of vernal pools.
