## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (e.g., California, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Arizona) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun to partial sun, typical of open, exposed habitats with little overhead canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Highly drought-tolerant, needs infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic natural arid conditions. Overwatering should be avoided. |

## 🌱 Overview
Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) or common buckwheat is a flowering plant in the knotweed family Polygonaceae cultivated for its grain-like seeds and as a cover crop. Buckwheat cultivation originated around the 6th millennium BC in the region of what is now Yunnan Province in southwestern China. The name "buckwheat" is used for several other species, such as Fagopyrum tataricum, a domesticated food plant raised in Asia.
Despite its name, buckwheat is not closely related to wheat, nor is it a cereal or a member of the grass family. It is related to sorrel, knotweed, and rhubarb. Buckwheat is considered a pseudocereal because the high starch content of the seeds enables buckwheat to be cooked and consumed like a cereal.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in bright, open conditions, requiring full sun exposure and minimal watering, reflecting its native arid scrubland environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs very little to no supplemental fertilization, making it suitable for low-maintenance, dry garden settings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; thrives in lean soils and generally does not require regular fertilization. If necessary, apply a very diluted, balanced fertilizer sparingly during the growing season.
