| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, Europe, and parts of Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Mediterranean |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours direct sunlight daily) for robust growth and flowering, tolerates partial shade but may become leggy. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. It tolerates some drought once established, but performs best with consistent moisture during its active growth. |

## 🌱 Overview
Raphanus raphanistrum, also known as wild radish, white charlock or jointed charlock, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. The species is native to western Asia, Europe and parts of Northern Africa. It has been introduced into most parts of the world and is regarded as a habitat threatening invasive species in many areas, for example, Australia. It spreads rapidly and is often found growing on roadsides or in other places where the ground has been disturbed. The cultivated radish, widely used as a root vegetable, is sometimes considered to be one of its subspecies as Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wild Radish thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. It is not demanding regarding soil fertility and can grow in average conditions without heavy fertilization. This plant is known for its adaptability and hardiness in temperate and Mediterranean environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a resilient 'weed' species, it can thrive in average to poor soils and does not require rich amendments. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth is lagging.
