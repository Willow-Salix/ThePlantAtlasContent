## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss requires consistently moist conditions, high humidity, and low light, replicating its native temperate forest and wetland habitats. Ensure the substrate is always damp, avoid direct sun, and provide minimal to no fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses thrive in nutrient-poor environments and do not require significant fertilization. If used, apply a very diluted solution sparingly.
