## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan and Yunnan. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Mountain Slopes and Grasslands |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it grows in open clearings, grassy slopes, and forest edges, indicating a need for bright light but also tolerance for some afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, reflecting the moderate rainfall in its native temperate regions. Good drainage is crucial to prevent root rot, so allow the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly before rewatering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cynoglossum is a genus of small-flowered plants in the family Boraginaceae (borage family). It includes 81 species native to Eurasia, Africa, New Guinea, and Australia.
Cynoglossum officinale, the common hound's-tongue, is a native of Asia, Africa, and Europe. It has been introduced into North America, and it is considered to be a troublesome weed because its burs stick to the wool of sheep and to other animals. Houndstongue is also toxic to cattle and other grazing animals due to the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which when ingested can lead to liver damage and photosensitivity in livestock.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Chinese Hound's Tongue thrives in temperate conditions with a preference for full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Mimic its native mountain slope habitat by ensuring adequate light and moderate, regular watering, with light fertilization during its growth phase.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Grows in soils of average fertility in its native environment. Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer applied sparingly once or twice during its active growing season (spring to early summer). Over-fertilization should be avoided.
