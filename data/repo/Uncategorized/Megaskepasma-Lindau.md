## 🧤 Care Instructions
Brazilian Red-cloak thrives in warm, humid tropical conditions with bright indirect to partial sunlight. It requires consistent moisture in well-draining soil, mimicking its rainforest origins, and benefits from regular fertilization during its active growth to support its vibrant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Regular feeding during the active growing season (spring through fall) with a balanced liquid fertilizer or a slow-release granular fertilizer, due to high nutrient demand in fast-draining tropical soils.
