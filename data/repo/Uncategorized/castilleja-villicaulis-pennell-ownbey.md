## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Oregon, California, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine, Semi-Arid Scrubland and Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in full sun exposure, mimicking its open, high-altitude native habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires excellent drainage and tolerates periods of dryness characteristic of semi-arid climates. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hemiparasitic plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean to moderately fertile soil. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and ensure a suitable host plant is present for successful cultivation, mimicking its native semi-arid montane habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a hemiparasitic plant, it primarily derives nutrients from a host plant. If cultivated, a lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soil is suitable, with minimal and balanced supplemental fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season if a host is not established.
