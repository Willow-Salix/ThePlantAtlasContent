## 🌱 Overview
Ochrolechia is the sole genus in the fungal family Ochrolechiaceae. It comprises about 40 species of crustose lichens. These lichens typically form uneven, often thick, crust-like growths on various surfaces and are characterised by their white to pale grey thalli, which may have a greenish tint. The genus has a long evolutionary history, with fossils dating back to the Paleogene period, about 34 million years ago. Ochrolechia species have disc-like apothecia (fruiting bodies), which are usually yellowish or brownish-pink and often covered with a fine white powdery coating. The genus is widely distributed and includes both common and rare species, with some found in extreme environments such as arctic and alpine regions. Ochrolechia lichens produce diverse secondary metabolites, including orcinol depsides, depsidones, and xanthones.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a crustose lichen native to California's oak woodlands, Ochrolechia californica thrives with high atmospheric humidity from fog and rain during cooler, wetter months. It requires no soil or traditional watering, absorbing moisture and nutrients directly from its environment. Provide filtered light and ensure good air circulation on a suitable woody substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; obtains all necessary nutrients directly from the air and the substrate it grows on.
