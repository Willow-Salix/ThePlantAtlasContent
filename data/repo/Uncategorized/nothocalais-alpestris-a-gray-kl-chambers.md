## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mimic its native high-altitude environment by providing full, intense sun exposure and consistently moist yet very well-drained soil. It is adapted to lean conditions, so fertilization should be minimal or unnecessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean, rocky alpine soils. A very light, balanced granular fertilizer can be applied once in early spring, but often unnecessary in good soil.
