## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Mediterranean grass thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, exhibiting strong drought tolerance once established. Water moderately during its active growth period, typically in cooler, wetter seasons, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Minimal fertilization is required, as it is adapted to poorer soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility needs. Thrives in average, well-draining soils. Over-fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
