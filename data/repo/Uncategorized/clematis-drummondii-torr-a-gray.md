## 🧤 Care Instructions
Drummond's Clematis thrives in full sun to partial shade within its native arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, necessitating infrequent yet deep watering, and requires only minimal fertilization for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder; an annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, as it thrives in lean, well-draining soils.
