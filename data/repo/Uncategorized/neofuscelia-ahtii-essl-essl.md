## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ahti's Neofuscelia Lichen thrives in cold, exposed environments typical of Alpine Tundra, requiring full sun on acidic rock surfaces. It sustains itself on natural atmospheric moisture and tolerates periods of drought, making artificial watering unnecessary. This lichen is extremely sensitive to nutrient enrichment, so all forms of fertilizer should be strictly avoided.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None; lichens are highly sensitive to pollutants and excess nutrients, which can be detrimental.
