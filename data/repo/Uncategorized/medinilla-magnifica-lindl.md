## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Philippines |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light. As an understory plant or epiphyte, it receives dappled light; direct harsh sun will scorch its leaves. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the potting medium consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch to dry slightly between waterings. Requires high humidity, so regular misting or a pebble tray is beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Medinilla is a genus of about 368 species of flowering plants in the family Melastomataceae, native to tropical regions of the Old World from Africa east through southeast Asia to Australia and the western Pacific Ocean. The genus was named after José de Medinilla y Pineda, governor of the Mariana Islands in 1820.
Species in this genus are evergreen shrubs or vines. The leaves are opposite or whorled, or alternate in some species. The flowers are white, pink, red, or orange, and are produced singly or in large panicles.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Showy Medinilla thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light, replicating its native tropical rainforest environment. Maintain consistently moist soil and provide high humidity for optimal health and flowering. Fertilize regularly during its active growth period to support its vibrant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Reduce or cease feeding during dormancy in fall and winter.
