## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Wallowa Mountains, northeastern Oregon, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun exposure, mimicking its high-altitude, open meadow habitat where it receives intense sunlight due to lack of tree cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during its short active growing season, allowing the well-drained soil to dry out between waterings. It relies on snowmelt and seasonal rainfall, so excellent drainage is paramount to prevent root rot, especially during dormant periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This high-altitude plant thrives in full sun and extremely well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its alpine origin. Water moderately only during its active growth period, ensuring excellent drainage, and avoid over-fertilization to best mimic its natural, harsh habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers lean, low-nutrient soils typical of alpine environments. Avoid heavy fertilization; a very minimal application of a low-phosphorus fertilizer once a year, or often none at all, is usually sufficient to prevent overgrowth and maintain hardiness.
