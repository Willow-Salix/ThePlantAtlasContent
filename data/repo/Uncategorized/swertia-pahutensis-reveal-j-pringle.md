## 🧤 Care Instructions
Alpine Swertia requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, replicating its natural subalpine wetland habitat. It thrives in full to partial sun and benefits from a light, balanced fertilizer application in spring to support its growth cycle.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, but over-fertilization should be avoided as native wetland soils can vary in nutrient richness.
