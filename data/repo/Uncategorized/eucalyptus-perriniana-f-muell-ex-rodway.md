| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern Australia (New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine/Montane Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open woodland habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; keep soil consistently moist but well-drained, especially when young. Established plants can tolerate short periods of drought, reflecting the seasonal rainfall patterns of its native range. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eucalyptus perriniana, commonly known as spinning gum, is a tree or mallee which is native to New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Tasmania. Spinning gum is a sub-alpine species and grows in areas which are normally snow covered for several months in winter. However domestic cultivars can grow in almost any temperate climate.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spinning Gum thrives in full sun and requires well-drained soil that is kept consistently moist, particularly during establishment. It is tolerant of cold subalpine conditions and benefits from a low-phosphorus fertilization strategy. Avoid waterlogging and excessive nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer designed for native plants, as Eucalypts are adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can be sensitive to high phosphorus levels.
