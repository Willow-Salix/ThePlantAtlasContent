## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Southern Great Plains of North America (USA: Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, etc.) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Semi-Arid Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. As a plant native to open sandhills and prairies, it thrives in direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Tolerant of drought once established, it requires infrequent but deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking natural rainfall patterns of semi-arid regions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Amaranthus is a cosmopolitan group of more than 50 species which make up the genus of annual or short-lived perennial plants collectively known as amaranths. Some names include "prostrate pigweed" and "love lies bleeding". Some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables, pseudocereals, and ornamental plants.
Catkin-like cymes of densely packed flowers grow in summer or fall. Amaranth varies in flower, leaf, and stem color with a range of striking pigments from the spectrum of maroon to crimson and can grow longitudinally from 1 to 2.5 metres (3 to 8 feet) tall with a cylindrical, succulent, fibrous stem that is hollow with grooves and bracteoles when mature.
There are approximately 75 species in the genus, 10 of which are dioecious and native to North America, and the remaining 65 are monoecious species that are endemic to every continent (except Antarctica) from tropical lowlands to the Himalayas. Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus Celosia. Amaranth grain is collected from the genus. The leaves of some species are also eaten.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy plant thrives in full sun and well-draining sandy soils, reflecting its native sandhill habitat. Water infrequently once established, allowing for dry periods, and provide minimal fertilization as it is adapted to nutrient-scarce environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in sandy, often nutrient-poor soils. Minimal fertilization is needed; an occasional light application of a balanced fertilizer may benefit plants in very poor soil, but generally, it is not a heavy feeder.
