## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in temperate and subtropical regions, including parts of Europe, North America, and Atlantic islands, often found in humid forested or coastal areas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Humid Forests, Subtropical Humid Forests, and constantly moist coastal environments. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light; prefers partial to full shade, avoiding direct, intense sunlight which can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies heavily on high atmospheric humidity and direct absorption of moisture from rain or mist; requires consistently moist air and substrate, but not standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sagiolechia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Sagiolechiaceae. These lichens form either extremely thin crusts within their substrate or live parasitically on other lichens without forming their own thallus. The genus is characterised by distinctive black, glossy fruiting bodies that begin embedded within the host material and later erupt to the surface, often developing elaborate folded or star-like forms. Sagiolechia contains six species found in diverse locations including Alaska, Greenland, Norway, and Madeira, with most species being quite rare and relatively recently discovered.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sagiolechia lichens thrive in environments with high humidity and indirect light or shade, mimicking their natural habitat on rocks or bark. They absorb moisture and nutrients directly from the air and their substrate, therefore requiring no additional fertilization. Maintaining consistent atmospheric moisture is crucial for their well-being.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not required; lichens obtain necessary nutrients directly from the environment and their substrate, and additional fertilization can be detrimental.
