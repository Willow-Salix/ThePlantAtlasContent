## 🌱 Overview
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fragrant Bedstraw thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, reflecting its native forest understory habitat. Ensure the soil remains consistently moist and provide partial to full shade. Fertilizer needs are minimal, adapting well to moderate soil fertility.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers nutrient-poor to moderately rich soils. A light application of balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient if growth appears weak.
