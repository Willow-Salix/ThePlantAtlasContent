## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dwarf Owl's-Clover thrives in full sun, requiring consistently wet conditions during its winter/spring growing season, followed by a dry summer dormancy. As a hemiparasite, it needs a suitable host plant to flourish and benefits from low to moderate fertilization to avoid harming its host.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a hemiparasitic plant, it obtains some nutrients from host plants. Excessive fertilization may not be beneficial and could potentially harm host plants.
