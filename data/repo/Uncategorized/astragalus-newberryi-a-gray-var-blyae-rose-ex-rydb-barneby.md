## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Great Basin region (Nevada, Utah, California, Arizona) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in exposed desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent and deep watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant, overwatering will cause root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Astragalus newberryi (Newberry's milkvetch), is a flowering plant in the family Fabaceae, native to the western United States from Idaho to New Mexico and California. A variety is found in the Death Valley area and the eastern Mojave Desert in California and Nevada. It grows in rocky and gravelly areas between  1,300–2,350 metres (4,270–7,710 ft) elevation.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full, intense sunlight and requires extremely well-draining soil to mimic its native arid environment. Water very sparingly, allowing the soil to fully dry out between deep waterings, and avoid overfertilization due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. If growth is poor, a very light, balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer can be applied once a year in spring.
