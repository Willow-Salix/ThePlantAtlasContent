| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal regions of North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Alaska, British Columbia) and Atlantic Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, British Isles) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Coastal Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect to partial shade; prefers diffused light and avoids harsh direct sun, especially in dry conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity and consistent moisture are essential. Requires frequent misting or a humid environment, allowing the substrate to dry slightly between hydration cycles. Does not tolerate prolonged dryness. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ochrolechia is the sole genus in the fungal family Ochrolechiaceae. It comprises about 40 species of crustose lichens. These lichens typically form uneven, often thick, crust-like growths on various surfaces and are characterised by their white to pale grey thalli, which may have a greenish tint. The genus has a long evolutionary history, with fossils dating back to the Paleogene period, about 34 million years ago. Ochrolechia species have disc-like apothecia (fruiting bodies), which are usually yellowish or brownish-pink and often covered with a fine white powdery coating. The genus is widely distributed and includes both common and rare species, with some found in extreme environments such as arctic and alpine regions. Ochrolechia lichens produce diverse secondary metabolites, including orcinol depsides, depsidones, and xanthones.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, humid conditions typical of temperate coastal rainforests. Provide indirect to partial shade and ensure consistent high humidity through frequent misting. Avoid direct sunlight and do not apply traditional fertilizers, as they can harm the lichen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens absorb nutrients from air and rain; traditional fertilizers can be detrimental.
