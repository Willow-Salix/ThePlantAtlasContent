## 🌱 Overview
Primula () is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. They include the primrose (P. vulgaris), a familiar wildflower of banks and verges. Other common species are P. auricula (auricula), P. veris (cowslip), and P. elatior (oxlip). These species and many others are valued for their ornamental flowers. They have been extensively cultivated and hybridised (in the case of the primrose, for many hundreds of years). Primula are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, south into tropical mountains in Ethiopia, Indonesia, and New Guinea, and in temperate southern South America. Almost half of the known species are from the Himalayas.
Primula has over 500 species in traditional treatments, and more if certain related genera are included within its circumscription.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained conditions. Provide bright, indirect light or partial sun, especially protecting it from intense afternoon heat. Maintain consistently moist soil and fertilize sparingly with a dilute solution during the active growing period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; a balanced, dilute liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the active growth period in spring is sufficient, reflecting nutrient-poor alpine soils.
