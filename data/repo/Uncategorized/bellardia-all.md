## 🌱 Overview
Flax, also known as common flax or linseed, is a flowering plant, Linum usitatissimum, in the family Linaceae. It is cultivated as a food and fiber crop in regions of the world with temperate climates. In 2022, France produced 75% of the world's supply of flax.
Textiles made from flax are known in English as linen and are traditionally used for bed sheets, underclothes, and table linen. Its oil is known as linseed oil. In addition to referring to the plant, the word "flax" may refer to the unspun fibers of the flax plant.
The plant species is known only as a cultivated plant and appears to have been domesticated just once from the wild species Linum bienne, called pale flax. The plants called "flax" in New Zealand are, by contrast, members of the genus Phormium.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bellardia All., native to the Mediterranean, thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering during its active growth from fall to spring, tolerating dry conditions in summer. It adapts well to leaner soils, with minimal fertilizer needed due to its hemiparasitic nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it is adapted to leaner soils characteristic of its native habitat and is a hemiparasite, obtaining some nutrients from host plants.
