## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted vine thrives in full sun and requires infrequent, deep watering, tolerating drought conditions. Fertilization should be light and primarily during its active growth period to mimic its lean native environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, diluted fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer). Avoid over-fertilization as it prefers lean soils.
