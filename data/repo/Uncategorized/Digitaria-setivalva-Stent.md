## 🌱 Overview
Digitaria is a genus of plants in the grass family native to tropical and warm temperate regions but can occur in tropical, subtropical, and cooler temperate regions as well. Common names include crabgrass, finger-grass, and fonio. They are slender monocotyledonous annual and perennial lawn, pasture, and forage plants; some are often considered lawn pests. Digitus is the Latin word for "finger", and they are distinguished by the long, finger-like inflorescences they produce.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This grass thrives in full sun and warm conditions, mimicking its native tropical and subtropical grassland habitat. It requires moderate, consistent watering during its active growth period, with some tolerance for drought. A light application of balanced fertilizer will support vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied lightly during the active growing season will support healthy growth without over-enrichment.
