## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, deep watering; allow soil to dry completely between waterings, especially during dormant periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cylindropuntia is a genus of cacti (family Cactaceae), containing species commonly known as chollas ( CHOY-əz), native to northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States. They are known for their barbed spines that tenaciously attach to skin, fur, and clothing.
Stands of cholla are called cholla gardens. Individuals within these colonies often exhibit the same DNA, as they were formerly tubercles of an original plant.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Whipple Cholla thrives in conditions mimicking its arid native habitat, requiring abundant full sun and very minimal water. It's crucial to use well-draining soil and allow it to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilizing is rarely necessary but can be done sparingly during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; a balanced, diluted succulent fertilizer applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season (spring/summer) is sufficient.
