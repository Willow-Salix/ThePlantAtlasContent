## 🧤 Care Instructions
This thistle thrives in full sun to partial sun conditions with moderate watering, adapting well to the fluctuating moisture of its native humid subtropical environment. It is not demanding regarding soil fertility, making it a low-maintenance plant once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring if soil is very poor.
