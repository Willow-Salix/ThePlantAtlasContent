## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Caribbean (e.g., Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Lesser Antilles) and parts of Central America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it grows in open woodlands and forest margins, suggesting it can tolerate direct sun but may benefit from some afternoon shade in intensely hot climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture. As a plant from humid tropical regions, it requires regular watering to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Fringed Passionflower thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical native habitat, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide regular fertilization during its active growth period to support its vigorous vining habit and prolific flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to regular fertilization. Growing in environments with decaying organic matter, it benefits from a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring through fall) to support vigorous growth and flowering.
