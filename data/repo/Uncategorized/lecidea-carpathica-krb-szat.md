## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This saxicolous lichen thrives in cool, clean air with bright light and consistent atmospheric moisture, mimicking its mountain habitat. It requires no soil, artificial watering, or external fertilization, deriving all its sustenance from the environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires no artificial fertilizer. It obtains necessary nutrients from clean air and precipitation and is highly sensitive to pollution and chemical additives.
