## 🌱 Overview
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cactus thrives in bright, direct sunlight, mimicking its native arid environment. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry out between sessions. Fertilize minimally with a specialized cactus formula during the active growing season.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; use a specialized, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer sparingly once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
