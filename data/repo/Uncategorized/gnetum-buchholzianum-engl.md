| **🌍 Origin** | West and Central Africa, including countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nigeria. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. As a liana climbing through the rainforest canopy, it thrives with dappled sunlight rather than harsh direct sun. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ephedra is a genus of gymnosperm shrubs. As of July 2025, 74 species, and two hybrids, are accepted. The species of Ephedra are widespread in many arid regions of the world, ranging across southwestern North America, southern Europe, northern Africa, southwest and central Asia, northern China, and western South America. It is the only extant genus in its family, Ephedraceae, and order, Ephedrales, and one of the three extant genera of the division Gnetophyta together with Gnetum and Welwitschia.
In temperate climates, most Ephedra species grow on shores or in sandy soils with direct sun exposure. Common names in English include joint-pine, jointfir, Mormon-tea, or Brigham tea. The Chinese name for Ephedra species is mahuang (simplified Chinese: 麻黄; traditional Chinese: 麻黃; pinyin: máhuáng; Wade–Giles: ma-huang; lit. 'hemp yellow'). Ephedra is the origin of the name of the stimulant ephedrine, which the plants contain in significant concentration.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gnetum buchholzianum thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light, mimicking its native tropical rainforest environment. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from regular fertilization during its growing period to support its vigorous climbing habit.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
