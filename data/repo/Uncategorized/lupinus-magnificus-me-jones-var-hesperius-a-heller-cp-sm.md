| **🌡️ Climate** | High Desert Scrubland and Montane Arid Slopes |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun, at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with its open, high-elevation native habitat. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted lupine thrives in full sun and requires very little water once established, preferring lean, well-drained soils. Avoid overwatering and heavy fertilization to ensure its health and promote flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization needed due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume; prefers lean, well-drained soil. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
