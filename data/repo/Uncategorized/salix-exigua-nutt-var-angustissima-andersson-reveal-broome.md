## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western and Central North America (United States and Canada), specifically in riparian zones, along rivers, and on sandbars. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Riparian Zones within broader Grassland or Forest biomes, characterized by consistent access to water and often seasonal flooding. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with its open riverbank habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native habitat along riverbanks and sandbars. Tolerates periodic inundation and even shallow standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This willow thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil, making it suitable for wet areas or near water features. Provide moderate fertilizer annually to support its vigorous growth, mimicking the nutrient replenishment of its native riverbank habitats, and ensure ample space for its spread.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced fertilizer applied annually in spring, especially in poorer soils. Its native riparian environments often have naturally replenished nutrients from sediment deposition.
