# Thermutis Lichen
### *Thermutis velutina (Ach.) Flotow*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions of Europe (e.g., British Isles, Central Europe) and North America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest, specifically in moist, shaded microhabitats such as on moss over calcareous rocks |
| **☀️ Light** | Low light to partial shade. This lichen thrives in environments shielded from direct sunlight, which can cause rapid desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high humidity and regular moisture, mimicking its naturally damp, shaded habitat. Misting or placement in a humid setup (like a terrarium) is crucial, allowing the substrate to dry slightly between hydration cycles but never becoming bone dry. |

## 🌱 Overview
Thermutis is a small genus of cyanolichens in the family Porocyphaceae. It was formerly treated in Lichinaceae, but a 2024 multilocus re-classification of the class Lichinomycetes emended Porocyphaceae and included Thermutis there. Species are minute, dark lichens with ecorticate, often gelatinous to squamulose thalli that occur on rock or soil in open, periodically wet microhabitats. Their sexual structures commonly develop as pycnoascocarps; the asci are prototunicate and the ascospores simple and colourless.
The genus comprises two species: Thermutis compacta and Thermutis velutina.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thermutis lichen thrives in consistently moist, shaded conditions, often on calcareous substrates. Provide high humidity and low light, ensuring the environment remains damp but not waterlogged. Avoid direct sun and the use of fertilizers, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor settings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from air and rainfall; introducing external fertilizers can be detrimental.
