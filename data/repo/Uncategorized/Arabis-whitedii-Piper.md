## 🧤 Care Instructions
Whited's Rockcress thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its native habitat on basalt cliffs. It is highly drought tolerant, requiring infrequent watering where the soil completely dries out between applications. Avoid over-fertilization and consistently wet conditions to ensure healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean, rocky soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very diluted all-purpose fertilizer only if growth appears weak.
