## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy mountain rose thrives in open, exposed conditions, requiring full sun and well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It needs moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between applications, and has low fertilizer demands. Ensure good air circulation to maintain plant health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to lean mountain soils. Apply a balanced slow-release fertilizer once in early spring if soil is very poor, otherwise minimal feeding is sufficient.
