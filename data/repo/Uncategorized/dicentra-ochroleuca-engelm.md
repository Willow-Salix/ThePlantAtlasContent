## 🧤 Care Instructions
Creamy Bleeding Heart thrives in conditions mirroring its native Southern California chaparral, preferring full sun to partial shade and very well-draining, sandy or rocky soils. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and benefits from minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light, balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or none if soil is naturally poor to moderately fertile.
