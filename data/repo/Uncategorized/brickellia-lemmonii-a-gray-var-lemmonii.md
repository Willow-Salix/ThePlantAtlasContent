## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico (Sonora, Chihuahua). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert Foothills. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot, as it's adapted to sparse rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Brickellia is a North American genus of about 100 to 110 species of plants in the family Asteraceae, known commonly as brickellbushes. They are found in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central America.  Many species are native to the American southwest, especially Texas. Brickellia is among the more basal lineages of the Eupatorieae and should not be assigned to a subtribe pending further research.
They are mostly woody perennial shrubs. Some species have a very strong pleasant scent, while others smell distasteful. All contain high amounts of essential oils. Germacrene D, a natural insecticide, is found in B. veronicifolia and probably other species, if not all.
Despite their chemical defenses, brickellbushes are food for caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera. These include the noctuid moths Schinia trifascia, Schinia oleagina, which is known only from Brickellia, Schinia buta, which is only known from B. californica, and Schinia gracilenta, which is only known from B. eupatorioides.
The genus is named for John Brickell, 1748–1809, Irish-born physician and naturalist.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lemmon's Brickellbush thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid scrubland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering once established, and has very low fertilizer needs. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot and promote healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. It thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its native desert scrubland. If desired, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season.
