## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern and Central United States, including states like Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Dry Prairies, Open Woodlands, and Rocky Glades |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers Full Sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) to ensure robust growth and abundant flowering. Can tolerate very light partial shade, but performance may be reduced. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate watering during its initial establishment phase. Once mature, it is highly drought-tolerant, thriving in conditions where soil dries out between infrequent waterings. Avoid consistently wet or soggy soil. |

## 🌱 Overview
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Scaly Blazing Star, provide a location with full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native dry prairie and open woodland habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and very little to no fertilizer to flourish.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. This plant is adapted to average to poor, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization is detrimental, potentially leading to leggy growth and reduced flowering. A light top-dressing of compost in spring is generally sufficient, if any is applied.
