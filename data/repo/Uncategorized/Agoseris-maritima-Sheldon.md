## 🌱 Overview
Agoseris is a small genus of annual or perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae described as a genus in 1817.
Agoseris is native to North America, South America and the Falkland Islands.
In general appearance, Agoseris is reminiscent of dandelions and are sometimes called mountain dandelion or false dandelion. Like dandelions the plants are (mostly) stemless, the leaves forming a basal rosette, contain milky sap, produce several unbranched, stem-like flower stalks (peduncles), each flower stalk bearing a single, erect, liguliferous flower head that contains several florets, and the flower head maturing into a ball-like seed head of beaked achenes, each achene with a pappus of numerous, white  bristles.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Seaside Agoseris thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, reflecting its native coastal Mediterranean habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it prefers nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; thrives in lean, well-drained soils. Avoid over-fertilization.
