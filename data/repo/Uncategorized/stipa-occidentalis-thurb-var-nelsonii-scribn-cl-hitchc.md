## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including mountainous regions of the Western United States (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada, Cascade Range) and southwestern Canada. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane Grassland and Semi-Arid Steppe, often at high elevations with cold winters and dry to moderately moist summers. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun is essential for robust growth, reflecting its natural habitat in open grasslands and forest edges with direct light exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. This drought-tolerant grass prefers infrequent, deep watering once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. It is adapted to seasonal dry periods and snowmelt. |

## 🌱 Overview
Stipa is a genus of about 140 species of large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and  spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to Stipa, which have since been reclassified into new genera.
Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as Stipa brachytricha, S. arundinacea, S. splendens, S. gigantea and S. pulchra are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.
It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Nelson's Needlegrass is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, adapted to the dry conditions of its montane and steppe origins. Provide infrequent watering once established and avoid excessive fertilization to ensure healthy, resilient growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soils and does not require frequent or heavy fertilization. Over-fertilization can reduce its natural resilience.
