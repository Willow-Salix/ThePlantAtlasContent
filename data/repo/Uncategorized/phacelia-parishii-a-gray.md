## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mojave Desert, Southwestern United States (California, Arizona) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full, direct sun for at least 6-8 hours daily, mimicking its open desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low watering needs; highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between applications to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Phacelia (phacelia, scorpionweed, heliotrope) is a genus of about 200 species of annual or perennial herbaceous plants in the borage family, native to North and South America. California is particularly rich in species with over 90 recorded in the region.
The genus is traditionally placed at family rank with the waterleafs (Hydrophyllaceae) in the order Boraginales. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, recognizing that the traditional Boraginaceae and Hydrophyllaceae are paraphyletic with respect to each other, merges the latter into the former and considers the family basal in the Euasterids I clade. Other botanists continue to recognize the Hydrophyllaceae and Boraginales after analysing the secondary structure of the ITS1 genetic region rather than its sequence for these higher taxonomic levels.  This placed Phacelia within the Hydrophyllaceae. Further molecular taxonomic analysis of the Boraginales has divided the Boraginales in two and placed Phacelia among the monophyletic herbaceous Hydrophyllaceae in Boraginales II.
The genus includes both annual and perennial species. Many have been cultivated as garden and honey plants.
There are reports that glandular hairs of stems, flowers and leaves of some species of Phacelia secrete oil droplets that can cause an unpleasant skin rash (contact dermatitis) in some people, specifically from P. brachyloba, P. campanularia, P. crenulata, P. gina-glenneae, P. grandiflora, P. ixodes, P. minor, and P. pedicellata. The major contact allergen of P. crenulata has been identified as geranylhydroquinone and of P. minor as geranylgeranylhydroquinone.
The mining bee Andrena phaceliae is a specialist pollinator of this genus in the Eastern United States.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Parish's Phacelia thrives in conditions replicating its native Mojave Desert habitat, requiring full sun and very little water. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs minimal to no fertilizer, preferring lean, well-draining soil to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required. Thrives in lean, well-draining desert soils, so excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
