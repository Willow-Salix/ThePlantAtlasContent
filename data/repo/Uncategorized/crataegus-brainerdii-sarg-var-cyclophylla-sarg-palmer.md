## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Brainerd's Hawthorn thrives in the temperate forests of eastern North America, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering, tolerating some dry spells once established, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization. Its robust nature makes it a relatively low-maintenance shrub or small tree.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; an annual application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is usually sufficient, or none if soil is naturally fertile.
