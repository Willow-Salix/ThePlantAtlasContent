## 🧤 Care Instructions
Linospadix thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest understory: low light, high humidity, and consistently moist soil. Protect it from direct sun and avoid waterlogging, fertilizing lightly during warmer months to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength during the growing season (spring and summer), typically once every 1-2 months. Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
