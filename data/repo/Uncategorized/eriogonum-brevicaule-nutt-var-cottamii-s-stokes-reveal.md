## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Utah, Arizona), specifically the Colorado Plateau |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings; highly drought-tolerant, adapted to very low natural rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cottam's Buckwheat is a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant ideally suited for full sun and well-draining, lean soils. Mimicking its arid scrubland origins, it requires infrequent watering and very little to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none, as it thrives in poor, rocky, or sandy soils characteristic of its native arid environment.
