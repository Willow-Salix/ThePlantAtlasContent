## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Pygmy Waterlily is a temperate aquatic plant that needs a consistently submerged environment in full to partial sun. It requires nutrient-rich soil at its base to flourish and produce its small, delicate flowers, often going dormant in colder winter climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in a rich, mucky substrate at the bottom of a pond or container. Benefits from the addition of slow-release aquatic plant fertilizer tablets pushed into the substrate during the growing season.
