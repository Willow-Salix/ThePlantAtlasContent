## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern and South-Central United States (e.g., Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Virginia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest / Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; thrives in open areas but tolerates some canopy cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering, especially when young; prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflective of humid subtropical rainfall patterns. Established trees are somewhat drought-tolerant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ulmus alata, the winged elm or wahoo, is a small- to medium-sized deciduous tree endemic to the woodlands of the southeastern and south-central United States. The species is tolerant of a wide range of soils, and of ponding, but is the least shade-tolerant of the North American elms. Its growth rate is often very slow, the trunk increasing in diameter by less than 5 mm (3⁄16 in) per year. The tree is occasionally considered a nuisance as it readily invades old fields, forest clearings, and rangelands, proving particularly difficult to eradicate with herbicides.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Winged elm flourishes in full sun to partial shade and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soils, typical of its humid subtropical forest origins. Provide regular water, particularly when young, and fertilize sparingly unless the soil lacks nutrients, ensuring a robust growth environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from a balanced fertilizer in spring if soil is poor, but generally not a heavy feeder in average to rich soil.
