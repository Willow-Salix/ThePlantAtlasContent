## 🧤 Care Instructions
Western astomum moss thrives in bright indirect to partial sun, requiring consistent moisture especially during its active growing season, though it can tolerate brief dry spells. It has very low nutrient needs, making regular fertilization largely unnecessary. Ensure good drainage and avoid prolonged waterlogging for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; mosses generally have very low nutrient needs. If desired, a highly diluted balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly, but is often unnecessary.
