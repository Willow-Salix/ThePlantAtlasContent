## 🧤 Care Instructions
This terrestrial orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate wetlands, requiring full sun and consistently moist to wet soil. Avoid drying out the roots and provide very minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor bog environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Very light fertilization with a highly dilute balanced orchid fertilizer (1/4 strength) once a month during active growth. Bogs are naturally nutrient-poor environments.
