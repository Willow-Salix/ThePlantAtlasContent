## 🧤 Care Instructions
Winter Creeper is a highly adaptable plant native to East Asian temperate and subtropical forests, thriving in a range from partial to full sun with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide moderate fertilization to support its vigorous growth. This hardy plant is relatively low-maintenance once established, reflecting its resilience in diverse natural settings.
