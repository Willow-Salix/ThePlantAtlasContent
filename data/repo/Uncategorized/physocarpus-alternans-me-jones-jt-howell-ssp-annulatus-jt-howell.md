## 🌱 Overview
Physocarpus, commonly called ninebark, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae, native to North America (most species) and northeastern Asia (one species). 
The genus name Physocarpus comes from the Greek for "bladder fruit", referring to the inflated fruits of some species. The common name 'ninebark' refers to the peeling bark of mature branches, which comes away in strips.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant shrub thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native rocky chaparral habitats. Once established, it requires infrequent watering, particularly during dry seasons, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Avoid overwatering to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally thrives in lean, rocky soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary.
