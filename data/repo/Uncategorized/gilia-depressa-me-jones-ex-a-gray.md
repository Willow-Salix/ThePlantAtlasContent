## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, Nevada, Utah, California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive in conditions similar to its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Water sparingly; this plant is highly drought-tolerant, accustomed to infrequent rainfall. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic arid conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Dwarf Gilia, replicate its native arid environment by providing full, direct sun exposure. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between sessions, and ensure excellent drainage to prevent root issues. This plant is adapted to poor soils, so supplemental fertilization is generally not needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Its native habitat features lean, rocky, or sandy soils, indicating it does not require rich nutrients or frequent fertilization.
