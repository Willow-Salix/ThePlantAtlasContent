## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Richardson's penstemon flourishes in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its native habitat of rocky slopes. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot, especially during wetter periods.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean to average soils. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring if growth is poor, otherwise often not necessary.
