| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal Eastern North America (from Massachusetts south to Florida, west to Texas along the Gulf Coast), and the Caribbean |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Coastal Salt Marsh |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) to ensure robust growth and abundant flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil; tolerates brackish water and periodic inundation. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely, especially during dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This aster thrives in full sun and consistently wet to moist soil, mimicking its native saltmarsh habitat. It is highly tolerant of brackish conditions and generally requires minimal fertilization. Ensure adequate water to prevent drying out, especially in containers or drier garden spots.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile marsh soils. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring may benefit growth in very poor soils, but is often not strictly necessary.
