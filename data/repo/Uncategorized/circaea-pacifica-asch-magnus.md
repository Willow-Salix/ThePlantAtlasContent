Plants of the genus occur throughout the temperate and boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in cool, shady environments with consistently moist, rich soil. Replicate its native temperate forest conditions by providing partial to full shade and regular watering to maintain soil moisture. Fertilize sparingly with organic matter to support its moderate nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder, benefiting from a rich, organic soil; an annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient.
