| **🌍 Origin** | Brazil (Atlantic Forest), São Tomé and Príncipe |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect light to partial shade; avoid direct, intense sun, mimicking the filtered light conditions of its native humid forest understory. |
| **💧 Water** | High ambient humidity is crucial. Requires frequent misting or placement in a humid environment (e.g., terrarium) to absorb moisture from the air, as lichens lack roots for soil watering. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in a humid environment similar to its native tropical moist forest, requiring consistent high humidity and indirect to partial shade. Avoid direct sun and the application of traditional fertilizers, as it primarily absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization is required. Lichens obtain necessary trace nutrients from natural precipitation and atmospheric dust; artificial fertilizers can be harmful.
