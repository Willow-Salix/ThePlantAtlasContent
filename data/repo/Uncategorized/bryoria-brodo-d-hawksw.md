## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Boreal and temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate and Boreal Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial Shade to Bright Indirect Light, mimicking the filtered light found under a forest canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high humidity and frequent moisture from the air (e.g., misting, fog, rain). It absorbs water directly from the environment, not through roots. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bryoria is a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. Many members of this genus are known as horsehair lichens. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in boreal and cool temperate areas. These lichens typically grow as slender, hair-like strands that hang from conifer trees or form small bushes, ranging in colour from dark brown to pale grey. They play important ecological roles, particularly as winter food for caribou in northern forests, where some species can accumulate in large quantities in the forest canopy. The genus contains about 35 species found worldwide, with ongoing discoveries of new species especially in mountainous regions of Asia and western North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Horsehair lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with filtered light, typical of boreal and temperate forests. It absorbs all its moisture and nutrients directly from the air and precipitation, making traditional watering and fertilization unnecessary and potentially harmful.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizer. Sensitive to high nutrient concentrations; absorbs trace elements from air and rain.
