## 🌱 Overview
Lolium arundinaceum, commonly known as tall fescue, is a cool-season, perennial C3 grass species native to Europe and introduced to North America and other parts of the world. It naturally occurs in grasslands and coastal marshes. Tall fescue is grown in a range of cultivars, widely used for livestock forage, in lawns and recreational areas as turf, and occasionally for managing soil erosion.
Most publications have used the names Festuca arundinacea or, more recently, Schedonorus arundinaceus for this species, but DNA studies appear to have settled a long debate that it should be included within the genus Lolium instead.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tall Fescue, native to temperate grasslands, thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist soil. It benefits from moderate fertilization during its growing seasons and is quite drought-tolerant once established, making it a resilient and adaptable plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization, particularly with a nitrogen-rich formula, during active growth periods in spring and fall.
