| **🌍 Origin** | Florida, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently, allowing the sandy soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering and waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This shortspike jointweed thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy conditions, mirroring its native subtropical scrubland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and has minimal fertilizer needs once established. Its care strategy revolves around mimicking dry, sunny, and nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; its native sandy soils are typically nutrient-poor. Fertilize sparingly with a slow-release, low-phosphorus formula, or not at all once established.
