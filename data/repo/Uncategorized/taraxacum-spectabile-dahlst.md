## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern and Alpine regions of Europe (e.g., Scotland, Scandinavia, European mountains) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Alpine/Subalpine, Temperate Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, exposed locations characteristic of meadows and alpine slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate and consistent moisture. Water regularly, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, mimicking temperate rainfall and snowmelt patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Taraxacum () is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, which consists of species commonly known as dandelions. The scientific and hobby study of the genus is known as taraxacology. The genus has a near-cosmopolitan distribution, absent only from tropical and polar areas. Two of the most common species worldwide, T. officinale (the common dandelion) and T. erythrospermum (the red-seeded dandelion), are European species introduced into North America, where they are non-native. Dandelions thrive in temperate regions and can be found in yards, gardens, sides of roads, among crops, and in many other habitats.
Like other members of the family Asteraceae, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is called a floret. In part due to their abundance, along with being a generalist species, dandelions are one of the most vital early spring nectar sources for a wide host of pollinators. Many Taraxacum species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Showy Dandelion is a resilient perennial that prefers full to partial sun exposure and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native temperate alpine and grassland habitats. It requires low to moderate fertility and is relatively low-maintenance, thriving in open, sunny locations with regular moisture.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility. This species is adapted to average meadow soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization; a light, balanced application in spring is sufficient if growth appears weak.
