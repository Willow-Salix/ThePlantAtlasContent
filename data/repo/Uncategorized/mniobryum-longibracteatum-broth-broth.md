# Mniobryum Longibracteatum
### *Mniobryum longibracteatum (Broth.) Broth.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Andes mountains of South America, including regions in Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane Tropical Forest (Cloud Forest) |
| **☀️ Light** | Low light to partial shade. Prefers indirect, filtered light, similar to the forest understory or misty conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist; never allow to dry out. Requires very high humidity, mimicking constant cloud cover and frequent rainfall characteristic of its native habitat. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in conditions mimicking its montane cloud forest origin, requiring high humidity, consistently moist substrate, and very low, indirect light. Avoid direct sun and ensure constant moisture to prevent drying out, as it cannot tolerate dry conditions. Minimal to no fertilization is needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs, absorbing what is necessary from water and the substrate. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
