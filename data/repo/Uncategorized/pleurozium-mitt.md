## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions, mimicking its native boreal and temperate forest floor habitat. Ensure consistent moisture for the substrate and provide high ambient humidity. Avoid direct sunlight and excessive fertilization, as its nutrient requirements are very low.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs and can be harmed by excessive fertilization. A light, infrequent feed with a dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer (if any) is sufficient, but often not necessary.
