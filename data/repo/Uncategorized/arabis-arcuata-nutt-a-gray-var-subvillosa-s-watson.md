## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rockcress thrives in bright, sunny conditions with excellent drainage, typical of its native montane and subalpine habitats. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal fertilization, making it an ideal, low-maintenance choice for rock gardens or alpine plant collections.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Fertilize sparingly, if at all. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial in very lean soils, but is generally not essential.
