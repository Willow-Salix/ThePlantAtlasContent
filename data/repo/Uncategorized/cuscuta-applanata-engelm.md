## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah) and Northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert Riparian |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure (full sun) is essential, as it typically grows in open areas. |
| **💧 Water** | This parasitic plant obtains all its water directly from its host plant; it does not require direct watering. Its host plants would typically be adapted to infrequent watering characteristic of arid environments. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cuscuta (), commonly known as dodder or amarbel, is a genus of over 201 species of yellow, orange, or red (rarely green) parasitic plants. Formerly treated as the only genus in the family Cuscutaceae, it now is accepted as belonging in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae, on the basis of the work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world, with the greatest species diversity in subtropical and tropical regions; the genus becomes rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern Europe.
Folk names include strangle tare, strangleweed, scaldweed, beggarweed, lady's laces, fireweed, wizard's net, devil's guts, devil's hair, devil's ringlet, goldthread, hailweed, hairweed, hellbine, love vine, pull-down, angel hair, and witch's hair.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gila River Dodder is a parasitic plant that thrives in high sun exposure, typical of its native arid scrubland and desert riparian environments. Its care entirely revolves around the health of its host plant, from which it draws all water and nutrients. Direct watering or fertilization of the dodder itself is not required.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a parasitic plant, it derives all necessary nutrients from its host plant; direct fertilization of the dodder itself is not applicable or beneficial.
