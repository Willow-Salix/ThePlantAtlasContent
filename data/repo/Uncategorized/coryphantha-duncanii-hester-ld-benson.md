## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in high light conditions, ideally full sun, mirroring its native arid scrubland habitat. It requires infrequent, thorough watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions to prevent rot. Fertilize sparingly with a cactus-specific formula during its active growth phase.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a low-nitrogen cactus-specific fertilizer during the active growing season (spring to summer), once a month or every other month.
