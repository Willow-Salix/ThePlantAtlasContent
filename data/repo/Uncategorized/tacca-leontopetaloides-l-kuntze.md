## 🌱 Overview
The genus Tacca, which includes the batflowers and arrowroot, consists of flowering plants in the order Dioscoreales, native to tropical regions of South America, Africa, Australia, Southeast Asia, and various Oceanic islands. In older texts, the genus was treated in its own family Taccaceae, but the 2003 APG II system incorporates it into the family Dioscoreaceae. The APG III and APG IV systems continue to include Tacca in Dioscoreaceae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical plant thrives in bright indirect light to partial sun and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil during its active growth phase. Allow for a drier, dormant period with reduced watering to mimic its native seasonal conditions, ensuring excellent drainage to prevent tuber rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize moderately every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluting to half strength. No fertilizer needed during dormancy.
