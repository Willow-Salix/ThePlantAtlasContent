| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Wet and Dry |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and fruit production. Young trees can tolerate partial shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist (but not waterlogged) soil, particularly when young and during flowering/fruiting periods. Established trees are somewhat drought-tolerant but perform best with consistent moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Sapodilla tree thrives in full sun and warm, humid tropical conditions with well-drained soil. It requires consistent watering, especially when young and during fruiting, and benefits from regular fertilization. Protecting young trees from frost is important as they are not cold-hardy.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced fertilizer application 2-3 times per year, especially during active growth and fruiting. Incorporating organic matter into the soil is also beneficial.
