## 🌱 Overview
Taraxacum () is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, which consists of species commonly known as dandelions. The scientific and hobby study of the genus is known as taraxacology. The genus has a near-cosmopolitan distribution, absent only from tropical and polar areas. Two of the most common species worldwide, T. officinale (the common dandelion) and T. erythrospermum (the red-seeded dandelion), are European species introduced into North America, where they are non-native. Dandelions thrive in temperate regions and can be found in yards, gardens, sides of roads, among crops, and in many other habitats.
Like other members of the family Asteraceae, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is called a floret. In part due to their abundance, along with being a generalist species, dandelions are one of the most vital early spring nectar sources for a wide host of pollinators. Many Taraxacum species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Porsild's Dandelion is an Arctic plant adapted to cool temperatures and open, exposed conditions. It requires full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil during its short growing period, thriving with minimal nutrient supplementation due to its adaptation to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor, so minimal or no fertilization is generally needed. If fertilized, use a very dilute, balanced solution sparingly once a year.
