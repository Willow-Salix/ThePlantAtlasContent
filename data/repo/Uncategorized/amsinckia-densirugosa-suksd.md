## 🌱 Overview
Amsinckia is a genus of flowering plants commonly known as fiddlenecks.  The common name is derived from the flower stems, which curl over at the top in a manner reminiscent of the head of a fiddle.  Fiddlenecks are in the family Boraginaceae, along with borage and forget-me-nots. The genus is named after the patrician Amsinck family in honour of the Hamburg head of state and patron of botany Wilhelm Amsinck (1752–1831).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, dry conditions, mirroring its native temperate grassland habitat. It requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between waterings, and has very low fertilizer needs. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is optional and typically not necessary in good soil.
