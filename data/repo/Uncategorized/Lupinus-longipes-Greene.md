## 🧤 Care Instructions
This montane lupine flourishes in full to partial sun and well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its natural habitat in the Sierra Nevada. It requires moderate watering, particularly during growth, but tolerates some drought once mature, and generally needs no supplemental fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils; avoid rich, heavy soils and over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen.
