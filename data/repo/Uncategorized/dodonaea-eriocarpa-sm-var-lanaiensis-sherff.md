## 🧤 Care Instructions
The 'A'ali'i (Dodonaea eriocarpa var. lanaiensis) is a hardy Hawaiian native that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and generally needs minimal fertilization. Its adaptability makes it a resilient plant for arid to mesic environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in nutrient-poor to moderate soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be given annually if growth is poor.
