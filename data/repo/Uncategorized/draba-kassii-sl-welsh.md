## 🧤 Care Instructions
Kass' Draba, an alpine plant, thrives in full sun and very well-draining, rocky, nutrient-poor soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization to mimic its harsh native environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky soil. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
