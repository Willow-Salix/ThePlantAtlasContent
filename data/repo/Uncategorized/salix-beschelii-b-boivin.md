## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid willow thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, mimicking its native bog and riverbank habitats. It requires full to partial sun exposure for optimal growth. Ensure abundant water, particularly in warmer months, and apply moderate fertilization for vigorous development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can promote vigorous growth, especially in poorer soils.
