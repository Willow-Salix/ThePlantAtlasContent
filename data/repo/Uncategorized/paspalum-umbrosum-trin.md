## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and South America, including Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama, and Venezuela. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest Understory or Forest Edges. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers partial to full shade, especially protected from intense direct sunlight. Thrives in dappled light conditions typical of a forest understory. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, but not waterlogged. Mimic tropical rainfall patterns with regular watering, allowing the topsoil to slightly dry out between waterings to prevent rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Paspalum is a genus of plants in the grass family.
The group is widespread across much of Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. Commonly known as paspalum, bahiagrasses, crowngrasses or dallis grasses, many of the species are tall perennial New World grasses. They are warm-season C4 grasses and are most diverse in subtropical and tropical regions.
Paspalum scrobiculatum (koda, varuka, varuku, etc.) is a millet locally grown as food grain. Some species, such as bahiagrass (P. notatum) and P. nicorae, are grown for pasturage, especially with the perennial forage peanut (Arachis glabrata) as a companion crop. Bahiagrass has also some significance as a honey plant.
Water finger-grass (P. vaginatum) resembles bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), but has a higher salinity tolerance and can consume greywater. It is not infrequently used for arena and golf course turf in warmer coastal regions, such as Baja California, Florida, Peru, Texas and Venezuela. Dedicated paspalum cultivars such as 'Aloha Seashore' or 'Platinum TE' have been produced for such uses.
Paspalums are also food for caterpillars of lepidopterans such as the pasture day moth (Apina callisto), and those of the dark palm dart (Telicota ancilla) which feed on P. urvillei. Granivorous birds often eat paspalum seeds; the chestnut-breasted munia (Lonchura castaneothorax) readily feeds on the seeds of  P. longifolium, for example.
The ergot Claviceps paspali is a sac fungus that grows on Paspalum, producing ergot alkaloids and the tremorgen paspalitrem; it causes "paspalum staggers" poisoning in cattle.
Tussock paspalum (P. quadrifarium) is considered a noxious weed in Australia. The term “paspalum” without qualification in Australia refers to the common lawn weed P. dilatatum.  Australia has five native  and approximately sixteen naturalised species.
Daikin Park, the home ballpark of the Houston Astros, has Platinum TE Paspalum as its field surface.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Paspalum umbrosum thrives in shaded tropical environments, requiring consistently moist, well-drained soil and protection from harsh direct sun. Moderate feeding supports its growth, mimicking the nutrient-rich conditions of a forest floor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization, particularly with a balanced liquid feed during its growing season. Rich, organic soil is preferred, reflecting the decomposing leaf litter in its natural habitat.
