## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (USA, Canada), particularly mountainous regions from Alaska south to California and New Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine and Alpine Tundra; characterized by cold winters, cool summers, and often moist conditions due to snowmelt and frequent precipitation. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; in its native habitat, it's often found in open, exposed areas at high elevations. |
| **💧 Water** | High; consistently moist to wet soil is crucial, mimicking its natural habitat along stream banks, bogs, and wet meadows. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Alpine Willow thrives in cool, moist environments with full sun to partial shade, consistent with its native subalpine and alpine habitats. It demands consistently wet soil conditions, replicating its natural preference for stream banks and boggy areas. Minimal fertilization is generally sufficient once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer can be applied annually if soil appears poor, but it generally tolerates less fertile conditions.
