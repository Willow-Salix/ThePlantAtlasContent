| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (specifically Maui and Hawaii) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Dry Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. This plant thrives in bright, direct light, reflecting its natural habitat in open shrublands and lava flows. |
| **💧 Water** | Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established, benefiting from infrequent but deep watering, especially during prolonged dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dubautia or na'ena'e is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. The genus was named after Joseph Eugène DuBaut (1796–1832), an officer in the French Navy who participated in Freycinet's expedition.
The entire genus is endemic to Hawaii. It contains more species than the other two genera in the silversword alliance, including cushion plants, shrubs, trees, and lianas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Shrubland Dubautia, provide full to partial sun, mimicking its native open shrubland environment. Water deeply but infrequently, ensuring the soil dries out completely between sessions to prevent root rot. Fertilizer is rarely needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is needed. If desired, a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly once in spring, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor volcanic soils.
