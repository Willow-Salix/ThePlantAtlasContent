## 🌱 Overview
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in perpetually wet conditions reminiscent of its native montane bogs and wet meadows. Provide full sun (or partial shade in hotter climates) and ensure the soil never dries out. It has low to moderate fertilizer requirements, preferring diluted feeding during its growing period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Use a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly once or twice during the active growing season, or a slow-release granular fertilizer in spring. Avoid high nitrogen.
