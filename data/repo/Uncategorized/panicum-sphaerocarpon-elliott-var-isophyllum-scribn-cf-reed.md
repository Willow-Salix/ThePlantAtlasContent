## 🧤 Care Instructions
This warm-season grass thrives in full sun to partial shade in temperate regions. It prefers moderate watering but is drought-tolerant once established, and has low fertilizer needs, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant suitable for open garden spaces or naturalized areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It can thrive in average to poor, well-drained soils. A light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring may encourage lush growth but is often not strictly necessary.
