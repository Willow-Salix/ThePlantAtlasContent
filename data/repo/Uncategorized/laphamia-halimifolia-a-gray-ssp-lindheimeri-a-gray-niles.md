## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Texas native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its arid, rocky natural habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering only after the soil has thoroughly dried out, and has very low fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; soils in its native arid habitat are typically lean. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very dilute, balanced formula only if signs of nutrient deficiency appear.
