## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal and Subalpine regions across Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia), Asia, and North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Boreal and Alpine Tundra Wetlands, specifically in peatlands, fens, and damp forest floors. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light; it thrives in shaded or dappled conditions typical of forest understories or bog environments. Avoid direct, intense sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist conditions, similar to its natural boggy habitat. High humidity is essential, and the substrate should never be allowed to dry out. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lophozia grandiretis thrives in cool, constantly moist, and highly humid environments with low, indirect light. Replicate its native peatland or damp forest habitat by ensuring consistent moisture, high ambient humidity, and avoiding direct sun and any significant fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None to extremely minimal. Bryophytes are generally very sensitive to salts and excess nutrients; their native peatland soils are typically nutrient-poor.
