## 🌱 Overview
Teucrium is a cosmopolitan genus of flowering plants in the mint family Lamiaceae, commonly known as germanders.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lacy Germander thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid environments. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or low-maintenance gardens. Avoid overwatering and excessive fertilization to ensure its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements. A light, balanced fertilizer once annually in spring is sufficient if grown in poor soil, otherwise it thrives with minimal nutrients.
