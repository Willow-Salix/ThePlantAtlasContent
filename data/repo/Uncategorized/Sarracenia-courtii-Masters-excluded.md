## 🌱 Overview
Sarracenia ( or ) is a genus comprising 8 to 11 species of North American pitcher plants, commonly called trumpet pitchers. The genus belongs to the family Sarraceniaceae, which also contain the closely allied genera Darlingtonia and Heliamphora.
Sarracenia is a genus of carnivorous plants indigenous to the eastern seaboard of the United States, Texas, the Great Lakes area and southeastern Canada, with most species occurring only in the south-east United States (only S. purpurea occurs in cold-temperate regions). The plant's leaves have evolved into a funnel or pitcher shape in order to trap insects.
The plant attracts its insect prey with secretions from extrafloral nectaries on the lip of the pitcher leaves, as well as a combination of the leaves' color and scent. Slippery footing at the pitcher's rim causes insects to fall inside, where they die and are digested by the plant with proteases and other enzymes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hybrid Pitcherplants require ample direct sunlight and consistently wet, nutrient-poor soil, reflecting their bog origins. Water exclusively with mineral-free water like distilled or rainwater, and never fertilize the soil. They thrive by catching their own insect prey for nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Do not fertilize the soil; these carnivorous plants obtain nutrients from insects they catch. Soil fertilization can harm their roots.
