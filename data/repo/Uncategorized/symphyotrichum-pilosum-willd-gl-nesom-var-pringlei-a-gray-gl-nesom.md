## 🌱 Overview
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pringle's aster thrives in full to partial sun with moderate, consistent watering, especially during dry periods. It prefers average, well-draining soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization, making it a relatively low-maintenance perennial suitable for temperate gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; thrives in average to moderately rich, well-draining soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial.
