## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, consistently wet conditions, typical of its native bog and fen habitats. Provide full to partial sun and maintain constantly moist soil, avoiding any periods of drought. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments and potential hemi-parasitism, fertilizer should be used sparingly or avoided entirely.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often hemi-parasitic.
