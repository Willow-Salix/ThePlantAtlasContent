| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Moist Montane Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light. Thrives in shaded conditions, similar to a forest understory or sheltered rocky crevices. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the growing medium consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. High humidity is beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Asplenium is a genus of about 700 species of ferns, often treated as the only genus in the family Aspleniaceae, though other authors consider Hymenasplenium separate, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, a different chromosome count, and structural differences in the rhizomes. The type species for the genus is Asplenium marinum.
The most common vernacular name is spleenworts, applied to the more "typical" species. A. nidus and several similar species are called bird's-nest ferns, the Camptosorus group is known as walking ferns, and distinct names are applied to some other particularly well-known species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fern prefers conditions mimicking its native moist montane forests, requiring low to indirect light and consistently damp, well-draining soil. High humidity is crucial for its well-being, and it benefits from infrequent, light fertilization during its growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a diluted balanced liquid fertilizer.
