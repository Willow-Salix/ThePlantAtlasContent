## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tribolium Grass thrives in bright conditions, requiring full to partial sun, typical of its native South African grasslands. It is adapted to dry periods, necessitating moderate to low watering with excellent drainage. Fertilization needs are minimal, reflecting its resilience in less nutrient-rich soils.
