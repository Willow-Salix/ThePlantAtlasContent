## 🌱 Overview
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This North American native thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist soil. It is relatively low maintenance regarding nutrients, adapting well to average soil fertility. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, to support its vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average soil fertility and can tolerate poorer soils. A light application of balanced compost in spring is generally sufficient if needed.
