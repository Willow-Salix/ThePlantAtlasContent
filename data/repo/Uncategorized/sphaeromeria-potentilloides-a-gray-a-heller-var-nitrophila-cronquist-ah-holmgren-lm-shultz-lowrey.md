## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and requires very little water, adapting to arid, desert-like conditions. Ensure excellent drainage and provide minimal to no fertilizer to mimic its native habitat. It is a highly drought-tolerant species.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. Native soils in arid regions are typically low in organic matter. If grown in cultivation, a very light, balanced fertilizer application once a year in spring may be tolerated, but avoid over-fertilizing.
