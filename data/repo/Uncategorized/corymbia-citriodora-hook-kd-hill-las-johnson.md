## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern Australia (primarily Queensland, extending into northern New South Wales) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Woodland to Tropical Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, reflecting its open woodland habitat where it receives high light exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during establishment, then drought-tolerant once mature. Thrives with moderate, consistent moisture but can endure periods of dryness typical of its native climate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Corymbia citriodora, commonly known as lemon-scented gum and other common names, is a species of tall tree that is endemic to north-eastern Australia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tree thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, tolerating various conditions once established. Provide regular water for young plants, reducing frequency as it matures, and apply minimal, low-phosphorus fertilizer. It requires ample space due to its large size.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Native soils in Australia are often low in phosphorus; use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer if needed, primarily for young trees.
