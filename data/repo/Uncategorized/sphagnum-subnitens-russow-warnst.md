## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of Europe, North America, and parts of Asia, specifically in peat bogs and wet heathlands. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Boreal Wetland (Bog) |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Avoid intense direct sunlight which can cause drying and damage. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires constant moisture, never allow it to dry out. Best kept in waterlogged conditions using distilled water or rainwater. High humidity is essential. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sphagnum is a genus of approximately 380 accepted species of mosses, commonly known as sphagnum moss, also bog moss and quacker moss (although that term is also sometimes used for peat). Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16 to 26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions.
As Sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. Thus, Sphagnum can influence the composition of such habitats, with some describing Sphagnum as 'habitat manipulators' or 'autogenic ecosystem engineers'. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants.
Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions.
Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, and any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sphagnum subnitens thrives in constantly moist to waterlogged, acidic, and nutrient-poor conditions with high humidity, typical of its native bog habitat. Provide bright, indirect light and use only distilled or rainwater, as it is highly sensitive to minerals and fertilizers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require fertilizer. Sphagnum moss is adapted to nutrient-poor bog environments, and high nutrient levels can be detrimental.
