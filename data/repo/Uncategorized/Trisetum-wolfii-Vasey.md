## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wolf's trisetum thrives in cool to temperate conditions with full sun to partial shade and well-draining, lean soil. Provide moderate, consistent moisture during its active growing season, reducing watering dramatically in winter to emulate its native snowy habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low, as it is adapted to lean, well-draining soils of mountain environments. A light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial if growth appears weak.
