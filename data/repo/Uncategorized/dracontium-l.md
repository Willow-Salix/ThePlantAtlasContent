## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical Central and South America, and the Caribbean |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can scorch leaves, as they typically grow in the understory. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, allowing the top inch or two to dry slightly between waterings. Requires high humidity, mimicking its native rainforest environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dracontium is a genus of flowering plants similar to those of Amorphophallus. Unlike Amorphophallus which is found in the Old World, this genus has a New World distribution and is native to South America, Central America, southern Mexico, and the West Indies.
Dracontium species can be distinguished from related genera by their inflorescence, which is smaller and unisexual. The plant has a large caudexlike tuber similar to that of Amorphophallus, but rounder, and with no central and circular scar mark. When Dracontium plants begin to flower, the tuber swells and smoothens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dracontium thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright indirect light, typical of its native tropical rainforest. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil and provide high ambient humidity. Fertilize lightly during the growing months to support its lush growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler, dormant periods.
