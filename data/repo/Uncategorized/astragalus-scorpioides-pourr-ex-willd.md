## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean habitat. It is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, particularly during hot summers. Fertilizer needs are minimal due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Apply a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring only if soil is very poor, otherwise not typically required.
