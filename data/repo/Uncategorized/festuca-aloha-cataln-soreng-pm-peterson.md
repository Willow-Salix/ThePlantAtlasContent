# Aloha Fescue
### *Festuca aloha Catalán, Soreng, & P.M. Peterson*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawai'i (Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa volcanoes, United States) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine Dry Grassland and Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun exposure, mimicking its open, high-elevation native habitat where it grows without significant canopy cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Tolerates dry conditions; water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. It is adapted to well-draining volcanic soils and does not thrive in consistently wet conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Aloha Fescue thrives in conditions similar to its native subalpine Hawaiian habitat, requiring full sun, well-draining soil, and moderate watering. It is drought-tolerant and accustomed to lean soils, so overwatering and heavy fertilization should be avoided to prevent stress and root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula in spring may be beneficial, but it is accustomed to nutrient-poor volcanic soils and does not require heavy feeding.
