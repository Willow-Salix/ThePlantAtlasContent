## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South Africa (Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical (Coastal Bush and Riverbanks) |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires bright, direct sunlight for optimal flowering, ideally full sun for at least 6 hours daily. Can tolerate some partial shade but may result in fewer blooms. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged during the active growing season (spring to fall). Allow the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce watering significantly in winter. |

## 🌱 Overview
The birds-of-paradise are members of the family Paradisaeidae of the order Passeriformes. They are found mainly in New Guinea, as well as eastern Australia and the Moluccas. The family has 45 species in 17 genera. The members of this family are perhaps best known for the plumage of the males of the species, the majority of which are sexually dimorphic. The males of these species tend to have very long, elaborate feathers extending from the beak, wings, tail, or head. For the most part, they are confined to dense rainforest habitats. The diet of all species is dominated by fruit and to a lesser extent arthropods. The birds-of-paradise have a variety of breeding systems, ranging from monogamy to lek-type polygamy.
A number of species are threatened by hunting and habitat loss.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Bird-of-Paradise thrives in conditions mimicking its subtropical South African home, requiring abundant bright, direct sunlight to encourage blooming. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil during its active growth period, and feed regularly with a balanced fertilizer. Ensure winter dormancy with reduced watering and protection from cold temperatures.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize regularly during the growing season (spring through fall) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, typically every 2-4 weeks. Reduce or stop feeding in winter.
