## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Cool temperate regions of Europe (e.g., Germany, Scandinavia) and parts of North America, typically in forested and montane areas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (Cool Humid) |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect medium light, replicating the forest floor under a dense canopy. Avoid any direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist substrate and very high atmospheric humidity. Frequent misting or cultivation in a closed terrarium is essential to prevent desiccation, mimicking its perpetually damp native environment. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort thrives in cool, humid, and deeply shaded environments, mimicking its native forest floor habitat. It requires consistently moist conditions, very high atmospheric humidity, and protection from direct sunlight. Fertilization is generally not needed, as bryophytes are highly sensitive to nutrient excess.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Bryophytes are highly sensitive to salts and nutrient overload. If used, an extremely diluted, specialized bryophyte or orchid fertilizer applied very sparingly (e.g., once a year) may be considered, but is often unnecessary.
