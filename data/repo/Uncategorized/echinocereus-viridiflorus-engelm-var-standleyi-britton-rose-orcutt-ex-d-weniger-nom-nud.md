## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., New Mexico, Arizona, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Grasslands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Can tolerate some afternoon shade in extremely hot climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings during the active growing season (spring/summer). Reduce watering significantly or cease during fall and winter dormancy to prevent rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. Mimicking its arid native climate, provide excellent drainage and minimal fertilizer to ensure healthy growth and flowering, especially during a dry winter dormancy.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Apply a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer). Avoid fertilizing during dormancy.
