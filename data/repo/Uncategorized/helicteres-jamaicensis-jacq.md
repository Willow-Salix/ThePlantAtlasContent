## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Screwtree, provide ample sunlight, from full sun to partial shade, and water regularly, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize moderately during the growing season to support its vigorous growth in tropical conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate, benefiting from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during its active growing season (e.g., monthly to bi-monthly) due to the generally rich but varied soils of its native forest environments.
