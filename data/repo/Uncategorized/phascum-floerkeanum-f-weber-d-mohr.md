# Floerkea's Phascum Moss
### *Phascum floerkeanum F. Weber & D. Mohr*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of Europe, Asia, North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Sub-Saharan Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Open Fields (often found in disturbed, bare, and calcareous soils within these areas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. This moss is often found in open habitats, so it can tolerate some direct morning or late afternoon sun, provided the substrate remains adequately moist. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the substrate consistently moist but well-drained. Allow the very top layer to dry out slightly between waterings, mimicking natural rainfall and drying cycles in open temperate environments. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Floerkea's phascum moss is an adaptable bryophyte preferring bright indirect to partial sun conditions. It thrives with consistent moisture in the substrate, allowing the very top layer to dry slightly between waterings, and requires little to no fertilizer. Its hardiness stems from its natural habitat in open, disturbed temperate areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. This moss is adapted to grow in less fertile, often calcareous soils and typically does not require supplemental feeding. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
