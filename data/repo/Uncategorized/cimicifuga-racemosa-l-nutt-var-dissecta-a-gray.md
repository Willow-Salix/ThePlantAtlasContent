## 🌱 Overview
Actaea racemosa, the black cohosh, black bugbane, black snakeroot, rattle-top, or fairy candle (syn. Cimicifuga racemosa), is a species of flowering plant of the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to eastern North America from the extreme south of Ontario to central Georgia, and west to Missouri and Arkansas. It grows in a variety of woodland habitats, and is often found in small woodland openings.
The roots and rhizomes are used in traditional medicine by Native Americans. Its extracts are manufactured as herbal medicines or dietary supplements. Most dietary supplements containing black cohosh are not well-studied or recommended for safe and effective use in treating menopause symptoms or any disease. A thorough literature profiling suggests that Cimicifuga racemosa is more efficient compared to a placebo in treating vasomotor symptoms resulting from natural menopause. The present review clearly encapsulates the use of CR extract for effective and safe therapy to alleviate menopausal symptoms.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To mimic its native forest understory, provide consistently moist, humus-rich soil in partial to full shade, shielding it from harsh afternoon sun. Ensure good drainage while maintaining soil moisture, and enrich the soil annually with organic matter for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, organic soil. Amend annually with compost or well-rotted manure, or use a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring.
