## 🧤 Care Instructions
Coville's Erigeron flourishes in full to partial sun with excellent drainage, mimicking its native California montane and chaparral environments. Once established, it is drought-tolerant and requires low to moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. Minimal or no fertilization is typically needed to ensure its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically not needed in native soils. If grown in very poor soil, a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
