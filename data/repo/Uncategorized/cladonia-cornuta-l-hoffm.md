# Cup Lichen
### *Cladonia cornuta (L.) Hoffm.*

![Cup Lichen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/CladoniaSpec01.jpg)

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across the Northern Hemisphere, including temperate and boreal regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Boreal Forests, Temperate Coniferous Forests, Heathlands, and Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers moderate to bright indirect light; can tolerate some direct sun in cooler, high-latitude environments but generally thrives with filtered or partial sun exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and consistent moisture from misting or rainfall, as it absorbs water directly from the air. Does not have roots for traditional soil watering; allow to dry out slightly between periods of hydration. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations.
Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).
Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.
Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dunes, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.
Larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes continuella, feed on Cladonia species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Cup Lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with moderate to bright indirect light, mimicking its native boreal and temperate habitats. Its care focuses on maintaining high atmospheric humidity and providing adequate light, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air rather than through roots or soil fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require fertilizer and is highly sensitive to nutrient enrichment and pollution. Fertilizers are generally harmful.
