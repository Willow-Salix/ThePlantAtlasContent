## 🌱 Overview
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in environments mimicking its native arid scrubland, requiring abundant direct sunlight and minimal watering. Ensure well-draining soil and fertilize very sparingly during its growing season to promote robust health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nutrient requirements; fertilize sparingly with a diluted cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
