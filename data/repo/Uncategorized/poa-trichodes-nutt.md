| **🌍 Origin** | Central North America (United States and Canada, particularly central and western regions) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, thriving in open, exposed areas typical of its native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, preferring consistently moist but well-drained soil. It exhibits some drought tolerance once established, adapting to periodic dry spells common in temperate grasslands. |

## 🌱 Overview
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hairleaf Bluegrass thrives in temperate climates with full to partial sun exposure, characteristic of open grasslands. It requires moderate, consistent watering for best growth, particularly during active periods, but can tolerate some drought. This species is adapted to average soil fertility, needing only low to moderate fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a native prairie grass, it is adapted to average soil fertility and generally does not require heavy fertilization.
