# Lemon Lichen
### *Candelaria A. Massal.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Cosmopolitan, widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere (North America, Europe, Asia) and parts of the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., South America, Australia, New Zealand). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate and Boreal Forests, Woodlands, and exposed rocky areas, often indicative of good air quality. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. As epiphytes or saxicolous organisms, they are exposed to varying light levels on tree trunks or rocks, but require significant light for photosynthesis. |
| **💧 Water** | High atmospheric humidity and frequent exposure to moisture (rain, fog, dew). Lichens absorb water directly from the atmosphere and substrate, requiring cycles of wetting and drying. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lemon lichens thrive in high humidity with bright indirect light, mimicking their natural habitat on tree bark and rocks. They absorb moisture directly from the air, needing frequent hydration cycles balanced with periods of dryness. Avoid traditional fertilizers as they can be harmful, relying instead on ambient nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain necessary trace nutrients from the air and their substrate; excessive nutrient loads can be detrimental.
