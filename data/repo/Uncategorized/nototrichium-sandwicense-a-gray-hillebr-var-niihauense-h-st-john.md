## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in conditions mirroring its arid island home, requiring abundant sunlight and well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant, so infrequent, deep watering is preferred over constant moisture. Fertilize minimally to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly once at the beginning of the growing season, or a diluted liquid fertilizer once a month during active growth.
