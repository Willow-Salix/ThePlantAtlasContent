## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, particularly Oregon and Northern California, USA. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (specifically vernal pool habitats, characterized by seasonal inundation in winter/spring and complete drying in summer). |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires good light exposure for optimal growth and flowering, typical of open vernal pool environments. |
| **💧 Water** | High moisture is crucial during its active growth period in winter and spring, mimicking vernal pool conditions. Allow to dry out completely in summer as the annual plant goes dormant and sets seed. |

## 🌱 Overview
Limnanthes, the type genus of the family Limnanthaceae, consists of annual herbaceous plants commonly known as the meadowfoams. The seven species are all native to coastal and adjoining regions (inland valleys, foothills and mountains) of western North America, where they typically grow in marshy habitats, such as the margins of vernal pools. Some are endemic to California.
General form ranges from decumbent to erect, with leaves either pinnately lobed or compound; the lobes or leaflets may themselves range from entire to deeply lobed. Both 4- and 5-sepaled and petaled members are known.
The white meadowfoam Limnanthes alba is of commercial interest for its oil, while several other species are rare or endangered. Honey produced by bees that pollinate Limnanthes alba has the distinct flavor of toasted marshmallows.
L. douglasii is widely cultivated as a hardy annual, its white and yellow flower colour giving it the common name of poached egg plant.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cultivate in full sun with consistently wet conditions throughout winter and spring to mimic its native vernal pool habitat. As an annual, allow the plant to dry out completely and die back in summer, relying on dropped seeds for regrowth in the following wet season.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native vernal pool soils are often not highly fertile. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied at the beginning of the growing season if soil is poor, but generally not critical.
