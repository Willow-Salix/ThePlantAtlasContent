## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Specific native origin is unresolved due to the 'nom. inq.' (nomen inquirendum) status of this scientific name. General Festuca species are typically native to temperate regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Specific native climate is unresolved due to the 'nom. inq.' status. Fescue grasses (genus Festuca) generally thrive in Temperate Climates, including Temperate Grasslands and open woodlands. |
| **☀️ Light** | General Festuca species, often found in temperate grasslands, typically require Full Sun to Partial Shade for optimal growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent with temperate climates, most fescues prefer Moderate watering; allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Drought tolerant once established but perform best with regular moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Due to the unresolved taxonomic status of 'Festuca auriculata Drobow, nom. inq.', care instructions are generalized based on common fescue species. These grasses generally thrive in full sun to partial shade and prefer moderate, consistent moisture. They are typically low-maintenance, adapting to various soil types with minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fescue grasses are generally not heavy feeders. Low to Moderate fertilization; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring or fall, particularly in poor soils, can be beneficial.
