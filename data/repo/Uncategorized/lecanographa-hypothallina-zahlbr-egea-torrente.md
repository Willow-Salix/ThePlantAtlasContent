## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal regions of Southern and Western Europe, including Macaronesia (e.g., Canary Islands, Madeira), Portugal, and Spain. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Maritime/Mediterranean-influenced coastal environments |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate some direct morning sun, especially when accompanied by high humidity. |
| **💧 Water** | Not watered like a typical plant; relies on high atmospheric humidity, dew, and regular rainfall. Requires consistently moist air; occasional misting can supplement humidity in drier indoor environments. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecanographa is a genus of about 20 species of lichens in the family Lecanographaceae. These lichens typically form thin, extensive crusts that can be chalk-white, grey, or pale green, with dark brown to black reproductive structures that are often covered in a dense frosting (pruina) of white, bluish, or greyish crystals. Established as a genus in 1994 by José M. Egea and Pilar Torrente, the lichens are characterized by their partnership with orange-tinged filamentous algae and their production of slender, spindle-shaped spores with multiple cross-walls that are wrapped in a gelatinous outer layer.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lecanographa hypothallina, a lichen, thrives in the high humidity and moderate light conditions found in its native coastal European habitats. It does not require traditional watering or fertilization, instead absorbing moisture from the air and nutrients from its substrate and the surrounding environment. Maintaining consistently high ambient humidity is the most critical factor for its care.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens absorb all necessary nutrients directly from their substrate (rocks or bark) and the atmosphere.
