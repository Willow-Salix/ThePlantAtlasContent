## 🌱 Overview
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Common Blue Wood Aster thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate woodland environment, preferring partial shade to full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Enriching the soil with organic matter will support its growth and reduce the need for additional fertilization, ensuring a healthy and robust plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate fertility. Benefits from rich organic matter in the soil (like leaf litter). Minimal or no fertilizer is needed if planted in well-amended soil.
