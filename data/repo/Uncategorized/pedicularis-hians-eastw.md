## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native meadow and streambank habitats. It prefers lean to moderately fertile soil and should not be over-fertilized, reflecting its adaptation to high-elevation environments and hemiparasitic nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; alpine soils are typically lean, and as a hemiparasitic plant, it may have specific host-plant nutrient relationships. Avoid excessive fertilization.
