## 🌱 Overview
Sarcogyne is a genus of crustose lichens in the family Acarosporaceae. It was circumscribed by German botanist Julius von Flotow in 1850. A proposal has been put forth in 2021 to assign Sarcogyne clavus as the type species of the genus, "as it represents the original concept of Sarcogyne as having melanized lecideine apothecia without algae in the margin".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sarcogyne lichens are exceptionally low-maintenance organisms adapted to harsh conditions. Provide them with abundant sunlight and allow for extended dry periods between natural re-wetting, as they do not require supplemental water or nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilization is necessary. Lichens derive nutrients from dust, air, and the substrate.
