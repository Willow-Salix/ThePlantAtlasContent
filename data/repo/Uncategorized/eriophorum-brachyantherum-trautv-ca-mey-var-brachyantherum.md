## 🧤 Care Instructions
This sedge thrives in consistently wet to saturated soil, characteristic of its native arctic and subarctic bog habitats. Provide full to partial sun exposure and avoid rich fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Native bog and tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor. Minimal or no fertilization is generally needed.
