## 🧤 Care Instructions
Kuroiwa grass thrives in full sun conditions, replicating its native exposed coastal habitat. It requires moderate to high watering with excellent drainage, preferring sandy, nutrient-poor soils and therefore needs minimal fertilization. This resilient grass is well-suited to conditions mimicking a tropical beach environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy coastal soils; a light, balanced fertilizer application once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
