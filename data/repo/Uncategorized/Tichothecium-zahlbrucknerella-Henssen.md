# Tichothecium zahlbrucknerella Henssen
### *Tichothecium zahlbrucknerella Henssen*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Known from specific localities in California, USA, and various parts of Europe where its host lichens thrive. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate to Temperate Dry Shrubland, characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons with periods of high sun exposure. |
| **☀️ Light** | High light to full sun exposure, mirroring the conditions typically favored by its host lichens which often grow in open, exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers periods of thorough rehydration followed by extended dry periods, absorbing moisture directly from rain or heavy dew, rather than traditional root watering. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a lichenicolous fungus, its survival is intricately linked to the health of its host lichens, such as Diploschistes species. Successful 'care' would involve maintaining conditions for the host, including bright light and cycles of wetting and drying, typical of open, dry temperate environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient requirements; relies on atmospheric deposition and nutrients derived from its host lichen, similar to typical lichen metabolism.
