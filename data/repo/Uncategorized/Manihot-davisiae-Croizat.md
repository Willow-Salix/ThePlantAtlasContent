## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings, and reduce water significantly during cooler months. It has very low fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to very low; native soils are poor in nutrients. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring if growth is desired, but it's often not necessary.
