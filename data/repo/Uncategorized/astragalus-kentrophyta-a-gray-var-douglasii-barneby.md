## 🧤 Care Instructions
Douglas' spiny milkvetch thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soils, reflecting its arid scrubland origins. It requires minimal watering and is highly drought-tolerant once established. Avoid over-fertilizing as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, and its native soils are typically nutrient-poor. Excess fertilizer can be detrimental.
