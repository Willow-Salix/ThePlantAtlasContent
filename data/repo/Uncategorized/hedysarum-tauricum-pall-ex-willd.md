## 🧤 Care Instructions
Crimean Sweetvetch thrives in full sun and very well-drained conditions, mimicking its native steppe environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to completely dry out between applications. Fertilizer needs are minimal due to its adaptation to lean soils and nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; minimal fertilization is needed, especially avoiding high nitrogen due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume.
