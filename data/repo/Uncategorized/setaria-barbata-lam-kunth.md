## 🧤 Care Instructions
East Indian Bristlegrass thrives in warm, humid conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade. Maintain consistently moist soil and provide moderate fertilization during its active growth to ensure vigorous development, while avoiding excessive dryness or waterlogged roots.
