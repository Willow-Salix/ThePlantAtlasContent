# Herbertus Aduncus Ssp. Tenuis
### *Herbertus aduncus (Dicks.) A. Gray ssp. tenuis H.A. Mill. & E.B. Scott*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Pacific Northwest, Alaska), also parts of East Asia (e.g., Japan) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Montane, specifically subalpine and alpine zones, characterized by high humidity, frequent mist or precipitation, and cool temperatures. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low light to partial shade; avoid direct sunlight, as it typically grows in shaded understories, on wet rocks, or as an epiphyte. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist conditions, but not waterlogged. Extremely high atmospheric humidity (frequent misting or terrarium environment) is crucial due to its bryophyte nature and native habitat. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort thrives in cool, highly humid environments with consistent moisture and very low light. Mimic its native montane habitat by ensuring constant moisture, high atmospheric humidity, and protecting it from any direct sun exposure.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Bryophytes absorb nutrients from rain and decaying matter; excessive fertilization can be harmful. If used, apply a highly diluted, specialized bryophyte or epiphytic fertilizer very infrequently.
