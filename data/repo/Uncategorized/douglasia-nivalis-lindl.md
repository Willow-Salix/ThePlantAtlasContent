## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including the Pacific Northwest (USA) and British Columbia (Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, ideally with morning sun and some afternoon protection in very hot climates. Requires bright light exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Requires excellent drainage and is intolerant of winter wetness. Drought-tolerant once established but performs best with consistent moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Androsace, commonly known as rock jasmine, is a genus of flowering plants in the  family Primulaceae, second only to Primula in the number of species. It is predominantly Arctic–alpine, with many species in the Himalayas (where the genus originated), the mountains of central Asia, the Caucasus, and the southern and central European mountain systems, particularly the Alps and the Pyrenees.
Plants of this genus are sometimes known as rock jasmines or fairy candelabras, and are widely cultivated for their dense cushions covered in white or pink flowers. There are roughly 110 species.
These plants have small entire or toothed leaves which form a basal rosette.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine gem thrives in full sun and exceptionally well-drained, gritty soil, replicating its native rocky slopes. It needs consistent moisture during spring and early summer but is highly intolerant of waterlogged conditions, particularly over winter. Fertilize very sparingly to encourage robust, compact growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Native to lean, rocky soils. Fertilize sparingly with a highly diluted, balanced fertilizer once in spring, or not at all if planted in rich enough gritty soil.
