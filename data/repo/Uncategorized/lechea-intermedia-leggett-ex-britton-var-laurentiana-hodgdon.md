## 🌱 Overview
Lechea (pinweed) is a genus in the family Cistaceae of the order Malvales. The genus contains about 18 species referred to as "pinweeds" primarily in eastern North America. Most are low-growing herbs with narrow leaves and many small flowers that resemble pinheads.
Linnaeus named the genus Lechea for Swedish botanist Johan Leche (1704–1764), who taught in Finland and is regarded as the father of Finnish meteorology and space research, based on his documentation of the northern lights and early measurements of air temperature in collaboration with Anders Celsius.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Largepod Pinweed thrives in sunny, dry, well-drained conditions, mimicking its native temperate heathland habitat. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering and fertilization once established, making it a low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers poor to moderately fertile soil. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release formula, especially in very poor soils.
