## 🌱 Overview
Fothergilla (witch alder) is a genus of two to four species of flowering plants in the family Hamamelidaceae, native to woodland and swamps of the southeastern United States.
They are low-growing deciduous shrubs growing to 1–3 m (3–10 ft) tall with downy twigs. The brush-like flowers are produced before the leaves in spring on terminal spikes; they do not have any petals, but a conspicuous cluster of white stamens 2–3 cm long. The leaves are alternate, broad ovoid, 4–10 cm long and 3–8 cm broad, with a coarsely toothed margin; they are noted for their brilliant orange or red fall colors.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, Fothergilla requires consistently moist, well-drained, and acidic soil, mimicking its native woodland habitat. It performs best in partial sun to partial shade, especially protected from intense afternoon sun. Ensure regular watering, particularly during dry spells, and amend the soil with organic matter for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers rich, organic, slightly acidic soil. Benefits from an annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring.
