## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ouratea plants thrive in conditions mirroring their native tropical rainforests, requiring consistent soil moisture and bright, indirect light. High humidity is crucial, and they benefit from moderate fertilization during active growth, while needing protection from harsh direct sun.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
