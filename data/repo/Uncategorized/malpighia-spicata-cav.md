## 🌱 Overview
Malpighia is a genus of flowering plants in the nance family, Malpighiaceae. It contains 108 species of shrubs or small trees, all of which are native to the American tropics, ranging from Texas through Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean to Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. The generic name honours Marcello Malpighi, a 17th-century Italian physician and botanist. The species grow to 1–6 m (3.3–19.7 ft) tall, with a dense, often thorny crown. The leaves are evergreen, simple, 0.5–15 cm (0.20–5.91 in) long, with an entire or serrated margin. The flowers are solitary or in umbels of two to several together, each flower 1–2 cm (0.39–0.79 in) diameter, with five white, pink, red, or purple petals. The fruit is a red, orange, or purple drupe, containing two or three hard seeds. M. emarginata, the acerola, is cultivated for its sweet and juicy fruits, which are very rich in vitamin C.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical shrub thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its native open habitats in Caribbean dry forests. It requires moderate to regular watering during active growth, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and benefits from moderate fertilization. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season.
