## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Russian Far East, Siberia (specifically around Lake Baikal region) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Continental, characterized by very cold, snowy winters and warm, often humid summers, typically found in forest edges, clearings, or rocky slopes. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial shade, thriving in open or semi-open locations where it receives ample light. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate and consistent watering during the growing season, mimicking its native rainfall patterns and snowmelt. Tolerant of some drought once established but dislikes waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cotoneaster  is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, native to the Palaearctic region (temperate Asia, Europe, north Africa), with a strong concentration of diversity in the genus in the mountains of southwestern China and the Himalayas. They are related to hawthorns (Crataegus), firethorns (Pyracantha), photinias (Photinia), and rowans (Sorbus).
Depending on the species definition used, between 70 and 300 different species of Cotoneaster are described, with many apomictic microspecies treated as species by some authors, but only as varieties by others.
The majority of species are shrubs from 0.5–5 m (1.6–16.4 ft) tall, varying from ground-hugging prostrate plants to erect shrubs; a few, notably C. frigidus, are small trees up to 15 m (49 ft) tall and 75 cm (30 in) trunk diameter. The prostrate species are mostly alpine plants growing at high altitudes (e.g. C. integrifolius, which grows at 3,000–4,000 m (9,800–13,100 ft) in the Himalayas), while the larger species occur in scrub and woodland gaps at lower altitudes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Cotoneaster thrives in a cold temperate environment with full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering during its active growth, with established plants tolerating some dry spells. Fertilizer needs are low, and well-draining soil is crucial to prevent waterlogging.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is generally sufficient, or it may not be needed in naturally fertile soil.
