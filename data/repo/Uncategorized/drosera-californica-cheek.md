## 🌱 Overview
Drosera, which is  commonly known as the sundews, is one of the largest genera of carnivorous plants, with at least 194 species. These members of the family Droseraceae lure, capture, and digest insects using stalked mucilaginous glands covering their leaf surfaces. The insects are used to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which the plants grow. Various species, which vary greatly in size and form, are native to every continent except Antarctica.
Charles Darwin performed much of the early research into Drosera, engaging in a long series of experiments with Drosera rotundifolia, which were the first to confirm carnivory in plants.  In an 1860 letter, Darwin wrote, "...at the present moment, I care more about Drosera than the origin of all the species in the world".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid sundew thrives in conditions mimicking its native bog habitat, requiring abundant bright light and consistently wet, nutrient-poor soil. Use only distilled or rainwater for irrigation, and never fertilize the soil, as the plant obtains nutrients from captured insects. Maintaining high humidity will further promote vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No soil fertilization ever; nutrients are obtained from insects. Soil must remain nutrient-poor.
