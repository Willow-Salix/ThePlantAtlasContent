## 🌱 Overview
A birch is a thin-leaved deciduous hardwood tree of the genus Betula (), in the family Betulaceae, which also includes alders, hazels, and hornbeams. It is closely related to the beech-oak family Fagaceae. The genus Betula contains 30 to 60 known taxa of which 11 are on the IUCN 2011 Red List of Threatened Species. They are typically short-lived pioneer species and are widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in northern areas of temperate climates and in boreal climates. Birch wood is used for a wide range of purposes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Sandberg birch thrives in cool temperate conditions with abundant moisture and good sun exposure. It requires consistently moist soil, mimicking its wetland origins, and tolerates a range of light from full sun to partial shade. Provide moderate fertilization for optimal growth and consider its need for consistently moist, well-drained soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied in early spring, particularly in less fertile soils. Rich, organic soil naturally supports its needs.
