## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Palau, Caroline Islands, Solomon Islands (Micronesia, Melanesia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light. In its native habitat, it grows in the understory or subcanopy, receiving filtered sun. Protect from harsh, direct afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking frequent tropical rainfall. Allow the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot, but do not let the plant dry out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ficus ( or ) is a genus of about 850 species of woody trees, shrubs, vines, epiphytes and hemiepiphytes in the family Moraceae. Collectively known as fig trees or figs, they are native throughout the tropics with a few species extending into the semi-warm temperate zone. The common fig (F. carica) is a temperate species native to southwest Asia and the Mediterranean region (from Afghanistan  to Portugal), which has been widely cultivated from ancient times for its fruit, also referred to as figs. The fruit of most other species are also edible though they are usually of only local economic importance or eaten as bushfood. However, they are extremely important food resources for wildlife. Figs are also of considerable cultural importance throughout the tropics, both as objects of worship and for their many practical uses.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Senfft's Fig thrives in conditions that mimic its native tropical rainforest. Provide bright, indirect light and maintain consistently moist soil, allowing the very top layer to dry between waterings. High humidity and regular feeding with diluted fertilizer during warmer months are crucial for healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Tropical rainforest soils are often rich but nutrients can be leached quickly. Fertilize every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength.
