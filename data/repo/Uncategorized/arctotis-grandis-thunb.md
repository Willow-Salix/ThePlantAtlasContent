## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South Africa (Cape Provinces) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (Dry Summer, Wet Winter) with adaptation to open, often disturbed or riverine areas |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) to replicate its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out between waterings, especially after establishment, reflecting its drought tolerance in a Mediterranean climate. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arctotis is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the family Asteraceae.
Arctotis is native to dry stony slopes in southern Africa. Some of the plants are alternatively placed in the genus Venidium. The common name is "African daisy", or "Gousblom" in Afrikaans. These plants have daisy-like composite flowers which tend to close in the late afternoon or in dull weather, but numerous cultivars have been developed for garden use which stay open for longer, and are available in a wide range of colours. Tender perennials are often grown in temperate regions as half-hardy annuals.
The garden hybrid A. × hybrida hort. 'Flame' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.  
Vigorous Arctotis hybrids like 'Pink Sugar' and 'Large Marge' are popular choices for garden design for the diverse colors of their blooms.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in full sun, the White African Daisy requires well-drained soil and moderate watering, preferring to dry out between sessions. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established and benefits from low to moderate fertilization during its active growth period. This approach mimics its native South African conditions, promoting robust growth and abundant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring, or a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks during the growing season is sufficient, as it's adapted to relatively leaner soils.
