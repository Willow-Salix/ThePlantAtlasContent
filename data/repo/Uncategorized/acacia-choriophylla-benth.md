## 🌱 Overview
Acacia, commonly known as wattles or acacias, is a genus of about 1,084 species of shrubs and trees in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the pea family Fabaceae. Initially, it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa, South America, and Australasia, but is now reserved for species mainly from Australia, with others from New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. The genus name is Neo-Latin, borrowed from Koine Greek ἀκακία (akakia), a term used in antiquity to describe a preparation extracted from Vachellia nilotica, the original type species.
Several species of Acacia have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Adapted to arid conditions, Slaty Wattle thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between applications. Minimal fertilization is required, making it a low-maintenance option for dry, sunny environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally requires little to no fertilizer. If needed, a slow-release, low-phosphorus native plant fertilizer can be applied very sparingly during the growing season.
