## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Pacific Northwest region (British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, northern California, Idaho, Montana). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest and Temperate Woodland/Shrubland. Experiences wet winters and relatively dry summers, often found in understory or forest edges. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers partial shade, especially in warmer climates or during the hottest parts of the day. Can tolerate full sun in cooler, moist conditions, but may scorch or become stressed in hot, direct sun. Also thrives in dappled shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular watering to establish, especially during its first year. Once established, it is quite drought-tolerant but benefits from moderate, consistent moisture, particularly during prolonged dry periods. Allow the top soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Berberis aquifolium, the Oregon grape or holly-leaved barberry, is a North American species of flowering plant in the family Berberidaceae. It is an evergreen shrub growing up to 3 metres (10 ft) tall and 1.5 m (5 ft) wide.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Oregon Grape is a resilient shrub native to the Pacific Northwest, thriving in partial shade and tolerating a range of moisture conditions once established. Provide consistent water during establishment and dry spells, and a light annual fertilization for optimal health. Its adaptability makes it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally a low to moderate feeder. Benefits from an annual application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a layer of compost in spring. Avoid over-fertilizing, especially in naturally rich soils.
