## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Appalachian Mountains, USA (endemic to Roan Mountain and surrounding high-elevation areas in North Carolina and Tennessee) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Montane (found in moist, rocky areas, seeps, stream banks, and high-elevation grassy balds) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade (thrives in bright, exposed high-elevation conditions but also tolerates dappled light at forest edges). |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil, replicating its native habitat in seeps and along stream sides; soil should never be allowed to dry out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Roan Mountain Sedge requires cool, consistently moist to wet conditions, performing best in full sun to partial shade. It thrives with ample water, mimicking its native stream-side and seep habitats, and prefers minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to lean, high-elevation soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; it is adapted to lean, rocky soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if planted in a rich, organic medium.
