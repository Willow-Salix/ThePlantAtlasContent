## 🧤 Care Instructions
Woollyhead is a resilient plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native arid and semi-arid habitats. Once established, it requires infrequent watering due to its high drought tolerance and generally needs minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to lean to moderately fertile soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season if soil nutrients are severely lacking.
