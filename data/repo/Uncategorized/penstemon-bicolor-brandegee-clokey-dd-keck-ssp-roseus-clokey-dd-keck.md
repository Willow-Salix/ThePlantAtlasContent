## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily California and Nevada, within the Mojave Desert region) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert (Mojave Desert) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. It thrives in high light intensity. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water sparingly and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering, especially in poorly drained soil, can be detrimental. |

## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pinto Beardtongue is a desert-adapted plant that thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil, mimicking its native Mojave Desert habitat. It requires minimal watering, being highly drought-tolerant, and should be allowed to dry out between applications to prevent root rot. Fertilization is rarely needed, as it is accustomed to lean, nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; typically does not require regular fertilization. If planted in very poor soil, a light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once a year in spring may be beneficial.
