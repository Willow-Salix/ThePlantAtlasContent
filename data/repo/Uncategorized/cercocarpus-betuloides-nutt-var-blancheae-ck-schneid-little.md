| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (specifically California, Oregon, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, and Baja California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Woodland and Chaparral / Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours direct sunlight daily) as it typically grows on exposed, dry slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering once established; highly drought-tolerant. Water deeply during prolonged dry spells, ensuring excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cercocarpus, commonly known as mountain mahogany, is a small genus of at least nine species of nitrogen-fixing flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae. They are native to the western United States and northern Mexico, where they grow in chaparral and semidesert habitats and climates, often at high altitudes. Several are found in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion.

 
The classification of Cercocarpus within the Rosaceae has been unclear. The genus has been placed in the subfamily Rosoideae, but is now placed in subfamily Dryadoideae.
Members of the genus are deciduous shrubs or small trees, typically reaching heights of 3–6 m (9–18 ft) tall, but exceptionally up to 13 m (40 ft) high. C. montanus usually remains under 1 m (3 ft) high because of incessant grazing by elk and deer.
The name is derived from the Greek words κέρκος (kerkos), meaning "tail" and καρπός (karpos), meaning "fruit".  It refers to the tail-like plume on the fruits.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Birchleaf Mountain Mahogany is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub that thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils. Once established, it requires infrequent watering and minimal fertilization, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or arid garden environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils; avoid over-fertilization, which can be detrimental. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial in very poor soils, but often not necessary.
