# Roselliniopsis Matzer & Hafellner
### *Roselliniopsis Matzer & Hafellner*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Himalayan regions (e.g., Nepal, Bhutan) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine/Subalpine, characterized by high altitudes, varied temperatures, and often high humidity from mist and snowmelt. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers bright, indirect light to partial sun. While tolerant of high light in its native exposed environments, consistent high humidity is crucial to prevent desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Primarily absorbs moisture from the atmosphere. Requires high ambient humidity, frequent misting, or exposure to dew/rain. Avoid prolonged desiccation; allow to dry slightly between hydration cycles. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a lichenized fungus from alpine environments, Roselliniopsis thrives with bright, indirect light and very high humidity. It requires atmospheric moisture and no traditional fertilization, being sensitive to pollutants and excess nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require conventional fertilization. Highly sensitive to excess nutrients and air pollutants, deriving essential elements from its substrate and atmospheric deposition.
