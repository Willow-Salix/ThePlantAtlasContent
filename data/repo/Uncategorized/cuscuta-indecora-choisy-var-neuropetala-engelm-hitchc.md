## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern and Central United States, Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Warm Temperate Grassland and Subtropical Dry Forest margins (often in disturbed areas, prairies, fields). |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure. This parasitic plant thrives on hosts located in bright, open conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Water needs are dictated by the host plant and are consistent with temperate to subtropical regions with seasonal rainfall; the dodder draws water directly from its host. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cuscuta (), commonly known as dodder or amarbel, is a genus of over 201 species of yellow, orange, or red (rarely green) parasitic plants. Formerly treated as the only genus in the family Cuscutaceae, it now is accepted as belonging in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae, on the basis of the work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world, with the greatest species diversity in subtropical and tropical regions; the genus becomes rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern Europe.
Folk names include strangle tare, strangleweed, scaldweed, beggarweed, lady's laces, fireweed, wizard's net, devil's guts, devil's hair, devil's ringlet, goldthread, hailweed, hairweed, hellbine, love vine, pull-down, angel hair, and witch's hair.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bigseed Dodder is a parasitic plant that requires a suitable host plant growing in high sun conditions. It obtains all its water and nutrients directly from the host, eliminating the need for separate watering or fertilization. Its presence is generally undesirable in cultivation due to its parasitic nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. As a parasitic plant, it obtains all necessary nutrients directly from its host, rendering soil fertilization for the dodder itself unnecessary.
