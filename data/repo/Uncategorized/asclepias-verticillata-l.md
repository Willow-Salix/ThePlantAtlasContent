## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (from Quebec to Florida, and west to Montana and Texas). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Temperate Forest (edge habitats) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, thriving in open, bright conditions typical of prairies and open woodlands. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It does not tolerate consistently wet or soggy conditions, which reflects its adaptation to well-drained soils in its native habitat. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Whorled Milkweed is a resilient plant best suited for full sun in temperate climates. It requires well-drained soil and tolerates drought once established, making it a low-maintenance option. Avoid overwatering and excessive fertilization to support its natural growth habits.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility requirements. It thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not need supplemental fertilizer. Over-fertilization can be detrimental, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-limited environments.
