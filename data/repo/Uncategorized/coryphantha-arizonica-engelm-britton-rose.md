## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus demands full sun and very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between applications to replicate its arid native conditions. Fertilize sparingly with a low-nitrogen formula during its active growth. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent any moisture-related issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; apply a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer). Desert soils are generally nutrient-poor.
