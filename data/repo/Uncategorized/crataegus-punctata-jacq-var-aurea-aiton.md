## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide full sun and moderate, consistent moisture in well-drained soil, reflecting its native temperate woodland edge habitat. While established plants tolerate some drought, regular watering during dry spells and light annual fertilization will promote healthy growth and fruiting.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, but generally thrives in average, well-drained soils without heavy feeding.
