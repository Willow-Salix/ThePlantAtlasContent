| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland, Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its origin in open plains and prairies. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, reflecting its adaptation to dry grassland environments. |

## 🌱 Overview
Stipa is a genus of about 140 species of large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and  spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to Stipa, which have since been reclassified into new genera.
Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as Stipa brachytricha, S. arundinacea, S. splendens, S. gigantea and S. pulchra are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.
It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.
