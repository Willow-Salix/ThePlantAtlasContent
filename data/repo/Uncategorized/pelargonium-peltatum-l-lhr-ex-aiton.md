## 🌱 Overview
Pelargonium () is a genus of flowering plants that includes about 280 species of perennials, succulents, and shrubs, commonly called geraniums, pelargoniums, or storksbills. Geranium is also the botanical name and common name of a separate genus of related plants, also known as cranesbills. Both genera belong to the family Geraniaceae, and Carl Linnaeus originally included all the species in one genus, Geranium; they were later separated into two genera by Charles Louis L'Héritier de Brutelle in 1789.
While Geranium species are mostly temperate herbaceous plants, dying down in winter, Pelargonium species are evergreen perennials indigenous to warm temperate and tropical regions of the world, with many species in southern Africa. They are drought and heat tolerant but can tolerate only minor frosts. Some species are extremely popular garden plants, grown as houseplants and bedding plants in temperate regions. They have a long flowering period, with flowers mostly in red, orange, or white, but intensive breeding has produced a huge array of cultivars with great variety in size, flower colour, leaf form and aromatic foliage.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ivyleaf Geranium, native to the open scrublands of South Africa, flourishes in full sun and well-draining soil. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and benefits from light, regular fertilization during its growing season to support its characteristic abundant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate; use a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring to fall).
