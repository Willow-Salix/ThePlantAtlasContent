## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Dixie Whitetop Aster thrives in partial to full sun in well-drained, moderately moist soil. Adapted to the humid subtropical climate of the Southeastern U.S., it does not require heavy fertilization. Once established, it exhibits good drought tolerance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. Being native to soils that may not be exceptionally rich (sandy/rocky), excessive feeding is unnecessary. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied sparingly in spring is generally sufficient.
