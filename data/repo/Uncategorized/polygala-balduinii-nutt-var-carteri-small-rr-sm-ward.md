## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full to partial sun with consistently moist, acidic soil, mimicking its native wet pine savanna habitat. It requires regular watering to prevent drying out and benefits from light fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy, acidic soils; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or light liquid feed during the growing season would suffice.
