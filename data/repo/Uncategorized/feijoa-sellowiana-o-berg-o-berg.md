| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical |
| **☀️ Light** | Thrives in full sun for best fruit production, but can tolerate partial shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular, consistent watering, particularly during dry periods and when fruits are developing. Once established, it exhibits some drought tolerance but performs best with adequate moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Feijoa sellowiana (or pineapple guava), also known as Acca sellowiana (O.Berg) Burret, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native mainly to the highlands of Colombia, southern Brazil and the hills of northeast Uruguay, but it can also be found in eastern Paraguay and northern Argentina. It is known as quirina (lusified from kanê kriyne by the indigenous Kaingang of southern Brazil) or as feijoa (fay-ho-uh in Spanish-speaking countries of South America or fee-jo-uh in the United States and New Zealand).
It is an evergreen shrub or small tree, 1–7 metres (3.3–23.0 ft) in height. The oblong leaves are about 5 cm (2.0 in) long, dark green on the upper side and white underneath. The flowers have five whitish petals which are puffy, possibly filled with some gas. There are about 25 dark red stamens projecting from the centre.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, Feijoa requires full sun and consistent moisture, particularly during fruiting, mimicking its humid subtropical native environment. Moderate fertilization supports healthy growth and bountiful fruit production, making it a relatively easy-care fruiting shrub.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization, especially a balanced or fruit-specific formula, applied during the growing season to support robust growth and fruit yield.
