## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical liverwort requires conditions mimicking its native cloud forest habitat: very high humidity, consistently moist substrate, and low, indirect light. It is ideally suited for terrariums or humid vivariums where stable moisture and atmospheric conditions can be maintained.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal. If applied, use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/8 to 1/4 strength) very sparingly during active growth periods, as it relies on atmospheric and substrate decay for nutrients.
