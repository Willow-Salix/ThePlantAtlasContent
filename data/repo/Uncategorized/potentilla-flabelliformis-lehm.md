## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun, mimicking its native open meadow habitats. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil throughout its growing season but should not be waterlogged. It is adaptable to average to lean soils and typically does not require heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to lean soils; excessive fertilization is generally not needed and can encourage leggy growth. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is optional.
