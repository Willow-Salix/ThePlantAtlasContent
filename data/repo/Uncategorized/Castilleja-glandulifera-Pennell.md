## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) reflecting its exposure on open slopes in its native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate; highly drought-tolerant once established. Requires consistent moisture during its active growth period in winter and spring, but very little to no water during dry summer months. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Gland Indian Paintbrush thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native Mediterranean chaparral environment. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing regular water only during its winter/spring growing season and minimal to no water during its dormant, dry summer. As a hemiparasite, it benefits from host plants and does not require significant fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; naturally grows in nutrient-poor soils and is hemiparasitic, meaning it taps into the roots of other plants for nutrients, making rich soil amendments or excessive fertilization unnecessary and potentially detrimental.
