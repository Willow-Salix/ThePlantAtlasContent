| **🌍 Origin** | Northern Australia (Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Savanna |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, brightly lit environments, similar to its native savanna woodlands. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth, especially during warmer months. Tolerant of dry periods once established, reflecting the distinct wet and dry seasons of its native climate. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Acacia, commonly known as wattles or acacias, is a genus of about 1,084 species of shrubs and trees in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the pea family Fabaceae. Initially, it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa, South America, and Australasia, but is now reserved for species mainly from Australia, with others from New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. The genus name is Neo-Latin, borrowed from Koine Greek ἀκακία (akakia), a term used in antiquity to describe a preparation extracted from Vachellia nilotica, the original type species.
Several species of Acacia have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant flourishes in full sun with moderate watering during active growth, becoming more drought-tolerant once established. It requires excellent drainage and thrives in nutrient-poor soils, making low-phosphorus fertilizer ideal if needed. Replicate its tropical savanna origins for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder. If fertilization is necessary, use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer specifically formulated for Australian native plants, typically applied during its active growing season.
