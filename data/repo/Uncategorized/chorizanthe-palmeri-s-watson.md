## 🌱 Overview
Chorizanthe is a genus of plants in the buckwheat family known generally as spineflowers. These are small, squat, herbaceous plants with spiny-looking inflorescences of flowers. The flowers may be in shades of red or yellow to white. The bracts are pointed and sometimes tipped with a hooked awn, and the inflorescence often dries into a rounded, spiny husk. Spineflowers are found in western North America and South America.
Name derivation: The word Chorizanthe comes from the Greek roots chorizo and anthos meaning "to divide," and "flower," thus meaning "divided flowers," but actually used in reference to the divided calyx.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Palmer's spineflower is a drought-tolerant annual that thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its arid scrubland origins. It requires minimal to no watering once established and generally does not need fertilization. The key to its care is providing a dry, sunny, and nutrient-poor environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
