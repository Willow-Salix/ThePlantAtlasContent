## 🌱 Overview
The genus Platanthera belongs to the subfamily Orchidoideae of the family Orchidaceae, and comprises about 150 species of orchids. The members of this genus, known as the butterfly orchids or fringed orchids, were previously included in the genus Orchis, which is a close relative (along with the genus Habenaria). They are distributed throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are terrestrial and have tubercules. The genomes of Platanthera zijinensis and Platanthera guangdongensis have been sequenced as model species to study partial and full mycoheterotrophy.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This terrestrial orchid requires consistently moist to wet soil, never drying out, and thrives in partial to dappled shade. Mimicking its native bog habitat, it needs minimal fertilizer. Ensure high humidity for optimal health and growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. If used, apply a highly diluted (1/8 to 1/4 strength) balanced orchid fertilizer sparingly during active growth.
