## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fuscidea Lichen thrives in cool, moist environments typical of boreal and temperate montane regions. Provide bright, indirect light and maintain high atmospheric humidity through regular misting to mimic its natural habitat. Avoid any form of traditional fertilization, as it is unnecessary and harmful to these unique organisms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens do not require traditional fertilization, and most fertilizers can be detrimental.
