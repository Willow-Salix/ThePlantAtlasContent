## 🧤 Care Instructions
Saffron Plum is a highly resilient, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining, often poor soils. It requires infrequent watering once established and minimal fertilization. Its hardiness makes it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or challenging, exposed locations.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; prefers lean, well-draining soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once annually in spring is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally fertile soil.
