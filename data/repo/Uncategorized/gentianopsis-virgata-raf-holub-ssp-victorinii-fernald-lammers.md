## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | St. Lawrence Estuary, Quebec, Canada |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Coastal Wetland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, as it naturally grows in open, unsheltered tidal flats. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native brackish tidal flat and marsh habitat. The soil should never be allowed to dry out, and it tolerates periodic inundation. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Victorin's Gentian is a unique plant demanding full sun and perpetually wet, well-drained soil, ideally with a brackish component to replicate its specialized St. Lawrence Estuary habitat. Careful management of constant moisture without stagnation, along with low to moderate nutrient levels, is essential for its challenging cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It thrives in soils that are not overly rich. A light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring should suffice, as excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
