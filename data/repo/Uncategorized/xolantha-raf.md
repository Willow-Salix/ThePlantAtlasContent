# European Frostweed
### *Xolantha Raf.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Europe, Asia Minor |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Shrubland/Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) as it originates from open, exposed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate; water deeply only when the top 1-2 inches of soil are dry. Its native dry, rocky habitats indicate drought tolerance once established. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
European Frostweed thrives in full sun conditions, preferring well-drained, lean soils typical of its native scrubland habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering. Avoid over-fertilization to prevent leggy growth and promote hardiness.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring if growth is poor, otherwise generally not needed as it thrives in lean soils.
