Ensure moderate to frequent watering during its active growth phases, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings to mimic seasonal rainfall patterns. Fertilize modestly during the growing season to support robust health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during active growth periods, especially if grown in containers or nutrient-poor soils.
