## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun and dry conditions, making it exceptionally drought-tolerant. Provide minimal water, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization for best health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Fertilization is generally not necessary, especially in suitable native soils. If desired, a very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
