## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Japan, Korea, and northern and eastern China |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Boston Ivy thrives in bright, indirect to full sun, reflecting its ability to grow on both forest edges and exposed surfaces in its native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering is preferred to maintain consistently moist soil, particularly during active growth, although established plants are tolerant of short dry spells, characteristic of temperate climates with distinct rainfall seasons. |

## 🌱 Overview
Parthenocissus tricuspidata is a species of flowering plant in the grape family (Vitaceae) native to eastern Asia (Korea, Japan, and northern and eastern China), where it thrives in floodplain bushes, riverside woodland and moist mountain mixed forests. Although unrelated to true ivy, it is commonly known as Boston ivy, grape ivy, Japanese ivy, and also as Japanese creeper, and by the name woodbine (though the latter may refer to a number of different vine species).
The specific epithet tricuspidata means three-pointed, referring to the leaf shape. Boston ivy is readily distinguished from the Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia) by its simple leaves with pointed lobes (Virginia creeper leaves are divided into five separate leaflets).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Boston Ivy is a resilient vine that prefers bright, indirect to full sun and consistently moist soil, although it tolerates some drought once established. Provide moderate fertilization during its active growth phases. This plant is relatively low-maintenance, thriving in conditions that mimic its temperate East Asian origins.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose feed during the growing season (spring and summer), indicative of its adaptability to varying soil richness in its native forest and rocky environments.
