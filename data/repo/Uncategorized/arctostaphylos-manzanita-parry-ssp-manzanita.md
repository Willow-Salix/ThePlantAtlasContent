## 🌱 Overview
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Whiteleaf Manzanita thrives in full sun and well-draining, nutrient-poor soil, typical of its native Mediterranean scrubland. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring very little summer water and minimal to no fertilization. Overwatering and rich soils should be avoided.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Adapts to nutrient-poor soils. Avoid heavy fertilization; excessive nutrients can be detrimental. If needed, a very light, balanced, slow-release formula in fall.
