## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate prickly pear thrives in full sun and requires very little water, adapting to its native dry grassland environment. Ensure well-draining soil and minimal fertilization to mimic its natural conditions, allowing it to withstand both heat and cold.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed, as it naturally grows in lean soils. If desired, a diluted cactus/succulent formula can be applied once or twice during the active growing season.
