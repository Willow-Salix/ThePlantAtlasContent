## 🧤 Care Instructions
Siberian Oatgrass is a cold-hardy grass that thrives in full to partial sun and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil during its active growth. It is not a heavy feeder, requiring only low to moderate fertilization. This species is relatively low-maintenance, adapting well to temperate and boreal climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, especially in poorer soils. May not require much fertilization in naturally fertile conditions.
