## 🧤 Care Instructions
This subtropical understory plant thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright indirect light. Maintain consistent soil moisture, allowing the top layer to dry slightly before rewatering, and provide light fertilization during active growth. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer), reducing or ceasing in fall and winter.
