| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah) and Baja California, Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in exposed desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low watering, mimicking its native desert rainfall. Allow soil to dry completely between infrequent waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eriastrum is a genus of flowering plants in the phlox family which are known commonly as woollystars. These wildflowers are somewhat diverse in appearance but are usually erect, thin-stemmed herbs which bear purple to white blooms. Most species have inflorescences which are webbed with a woolly mesh of white fibers. Woollystars are native to western North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native requires full, direct sun and extremely well-draining, lean soil to thrive. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Fertilization is generally not necessary, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed; it thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils typical of its desert habitat. Avoid rich organic matter.
