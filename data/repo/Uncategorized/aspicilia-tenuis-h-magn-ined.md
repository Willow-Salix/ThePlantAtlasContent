## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern Hemisphere, particularly alpine and arctic regions, and exposed temperate rocky areas (e.g., Scandinavia, North America) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra or exposed Cold-Temperate Rocky Outcrops |
| **☀️ Light** | High light conditions, often full sun, on exposed rock surfaces. Can tolerate partial shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Absorbs moisture directly from rain, dew, and atmospheric humidity; highly tolerant of prolonged drought periods when dormant. Does not require active 'watering'. |

## 🌱 Overview
Aspicilia (sunken disk lichen) is a genus of mostly crustose areolate lichens that grow on rock. Most members have black apothecia discs that are slightly immersed in the areolas, hence the common name"Given the same reason, the  naming of Aspicilia is derived from the Greek word for "shield concave". 
Most of the species of this genus grow on calcareous and acidic rocks and most of the taxa prefer temperate and arctic habitats.
Some members of the genus Aspicilia are pioneer species on granite and other hard rock, after which members of other lichen species may grow on them, such as members of Acarospora.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Rimmed Lichen thrives on stable, exposed rock surfaces in high light environments. It requires clean air and moisture from natural precipitation and humidity, being highly resilient to drought. Avoid pollution and artificial fertilization, as these are harmful to its delicate symbiotic structure.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require fertilization; sensitive to air pollution and excess nutrients, which can be detrimental to its health.
