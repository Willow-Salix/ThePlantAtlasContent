## 🧤 Care Instructions
To mimic its native rainforest understory, provide the Walking-Stick Palm with low to partial indirect light and ensure its soil remains consistently moist. High humidity is critical for its well-being, so consider regular misting. Fertilize sparingly during the growing months to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer), typically once a month or every other month.
