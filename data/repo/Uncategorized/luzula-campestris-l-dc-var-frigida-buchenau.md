## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine variety of Field Wood-rush flourishes in cool, bright conditions found in mountain grasslands. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and prefers ample light from full sun to partial shade. Fertilization should be minimal, reflecting its adaptation to less fertile native environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Native mountain soils are often not exceptionally rich, so a light application of a balanced fertilizer once annually in spring is typically sufficient, or none if grown in good quality soil.
