## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate with wet winters and dry summers. It requires a host plant to grow successfully and needs minimal watering once established, with little to no fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. As a hemiparasitic plant, it obtains nutrients from host plant roots and prefers lean, well-drained soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
