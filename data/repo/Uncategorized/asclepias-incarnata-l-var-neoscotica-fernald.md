## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern Canada (specifically Nova Scotia) and Northeastern United States |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate Wetlands (e.g., swamps, marshes, wet meadows) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it typically grows in open, unshaded wetland areas. |
| **💧 Water** | High; soil should remain consistently moist to wet, mimicking its native habitat where it often grows in saturated soil or standing water. Requires frequent watering, especially in drier conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Asclepias incarnata, the swamp milkweed, rose milkweed, rose milkflower, swamp silkweed, or white Indian hemp, is a herbaceous perennial plant species native to North America. It grows in damp through wet soils and also is cultivated as a garden plant for its flowers, which attract butterflies and other pollinators with nectar. Like most other milkweeds, it has latex containing toxic steroids, a characteristic that repels many species of insects and mammals.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet to moist soil, mirroring its natural wetland habitat. Ensure a rich, fertile growing medium to support its robust growth and frequent watering to maintain soil saturation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high; benefits from rich, fertile soil abundant in organic matter, typical of wetland environments. A balanced all-purpose fertilizer can be used if soil fertility is low.
