## 🧤 Care Instructions
Horseshoe Vetch thrives in full sun and well-drained, alkaline soils, characteristic of its native chalk grasslands. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications. Minimal or no fertilizer is needed due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile, alkaline soils. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, therefore, minimal to no additional fertilizer is needed, and high-nitrogen feeds should be avoided.
