## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (specifically the Intermountain West region of the United States, including Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-Arid Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (requires direct sun exposure for most of the day) |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering (highly drought-tolerant; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially crucial during dormancy or in cooler months) |

## 🌱 Overview
Oreocarya (perennial cat's-eye) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. There are about 63 species and its native range extends from western and central Canada, through western United States to north Mexico. It is part of subtribe of Amsinckiinae.
It was once thought to be a either a subgenus or synonym of Cryptantha Lehm. ex G. Don, as they both had plenty of tiny flowers, hairy leaves, and persisting dried flower stems.
Botanist William Alfred Weber later noted that the 2 genera were different in form as Oreocarya was a "biennial or perennial from rosettes of basal leaves; flowers more than 5 mm in diameter, often distinctly long-tubular with prominent yellow eye", while Cryptantha was an "annual without rosettes of basal leaves; flowers minute, less than 5 mm diameter, short-tubed with inconspicuous eye".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soil, mimicking its native arid scrubland habitat. Water sparingly, only when the soil is completely dry, and avoid rich fertilizers to prevent root rot and encourage its natural resilience to harsh conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs (thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental)
