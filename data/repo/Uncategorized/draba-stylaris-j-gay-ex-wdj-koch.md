## 🧤 Care Instructions
Draba stylaris flourishes in conditions replicating its alpine home, needing abundant sunlight and exceptionally well-drained soil. Water moderately, ensuring the soil never becomes waterlogged, and apply fertilizer sparingly or not at all to mimic its lean natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; native soils are often lean and rocky. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental. A light, balanced feed once in spring is sufficient if desired.
