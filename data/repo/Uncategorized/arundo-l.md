## 🌱 Overview
Arundo donax is a tall perennial cane. It is one of several so-called reed species. It has several common names including giant cane, elephant grass, carrizo, arundo, Spanish cane, Colorado river reed, wild cane, and giant reed. Arundo and donax are respectively the old Latin and Greek names for reed.
Arundo donax grows in damp soils, either fresh or moderately saline, and is native to the Greater Middle East. It has been widely planted and naturalised in the mild temperate, subtropical and tropical regions of both hemispheres, especially in the Mediterranean, California, the western Pacific and the Caribbean and is considered invasive in North America and Oceania. It forms dense stands on disturbed sites, sand dunes, in wetlands and riparian habitats.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Giant Reed thrives in full sun and requires abundant water, mimicking its native riparian habitats. It benefits from moderate to high soil fertility to sustain its rapid growth, making it a robust but water-intensive plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high fertility; benefits from regular feeding to support its vigorous growth, especially in poor soils. Thrives in rich, disturbed soils.
