# Arthopyrenia esenbeckiana
### *Arthopyrenia esenbeckiana (FÃ©e) R.C. Harris*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama, and the southeastern United States (e.g., Florida). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium, indirect or filtered light. This lichen, often found on tree bark in humid forests, avoids direct, intense sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity is crucial. In a cultivated setting, frequent misting and a consistently moist (but not waterlogged) environment are necessary. Avoid dry air. |

## 🌱 Overview
Constrictolumina esenbeckiana is a species of corticolous (bark-dwelling) crustose lichen in the family Trypetheliaceae. This neotropical lichen forms thin, whitish crusts on tree bark and produces small, hemispherical fruiting bodies that often occur in dense clusters of 5–20 individuals that may fuse together sideways. It is known from the Caribbean Antilles and Brazil, where it grows in tropical habitats, though most records are historical.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical bark lichen thrives in high humidity and low to medium, indirect light, mimicking its native rainforest habitat. It requires consistent environmental moisture through misting or high ambient humidity, and generally needs no supplemental fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Lichens obtain most nutrients from air and rain. Fertilizer is generally not needed and can be harmful; if used, apply an extremely diluted solution very sparingly.
