## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and alpine regions of North America (Alaska, Arctic Canada), Greenland, Svalbard, Fennoscandia, and Arctic Russia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure; requires bright, direct light for most of the day, as it grows in exposed, treeless environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate and consistent watering during its short active growing season, allowing excellent drainage. It does not tolerate prolonged drought but is very susceptible to root rot in waterlogged conditions. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Milky Draba thrives in bright, direct sunlight, mimicking its exposed alpine and arctic tundra habitat. It requires consistent, moderate watering with excellent drainage during its short growing season and prefers lean, rocky soils with very low fertilizer needs. Mimic its cold, exposed native conditions for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Native soils are typically lean and rocky; over-fertilization can be detrimental. A minimal, balanced fertilizer once early in the growing season, if at all, is sufficient.
