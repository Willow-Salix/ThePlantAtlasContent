## 🧤 Care Instructions
Homalia jamesii Schimp. thrives in consistently cool, moist, and deeply shaded conditions, replicating its native temperate rainforest habitat. Ensure high ambient humidity and a constantly damp substrate, as drying out is fatal. Fertilizer should be used sparingly, if at all.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is needed. Mosses absorb nutrients from their environment and excessive fertilization can be detrimental. If desired, a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year.
