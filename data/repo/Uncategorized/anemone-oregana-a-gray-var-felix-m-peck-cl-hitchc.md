## 🧤 Care Instructions
This bog anemone thrives in consistently moist to wet, acidic soils, mirroring its native wetland habitats in Western Oregon. It prefers partial shade, though it can tolerate more sun in cooler, moist conditions, and requires minimal to no fertilization. Ensure constant soil moisture to mimic its natural bog environment and prevent stress.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately rich, acidic soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, to avoid nutrient burn.
