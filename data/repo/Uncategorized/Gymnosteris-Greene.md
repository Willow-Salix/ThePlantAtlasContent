## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Intermountain West (e.g., California, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Arizona) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Cold Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in exposed, treeless landscapes with intense solar radiation. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent; highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic natural sporadic rainfall patterns in arid regions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gymnosteris is a small genus of flowering plants in the phlox family. These are small annual herbs which are native to the western United States. They generally lack leaves, but the bracts are large, fleshy, and leaflike.
There are two species:

Gymnosteris nudicaulis - nakedstem gymnosteris
Gymnosteris parvula - smallflower gymnosteris

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gymnosteris thrives in bright, full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering that allows the soil to dry out completely. Mimicking its arid scrubland origin, it prefers well-draining soil and has very low fertilizer requirements. Avoid overwatering to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; these plants are adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils. Minimal or no fertilization is typically needed, perhaps a very diluted general-purpose fertilizer once a year if grown in containers.
