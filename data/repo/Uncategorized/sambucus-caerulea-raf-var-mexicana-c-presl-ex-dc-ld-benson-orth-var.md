## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mexican Elderberry is an adaptable shrub or small tree thriving in full sun to partial shade in Mediterranean and semi-arid climates. It requires moderate watering, preferring to dry out between sessions, and has low fertilizer needs, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant once established.
