## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (Maui, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Dry to Mesic Shrubland and Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Sun; thrives in exposed conditions typical of shrublands and higher elevations. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; allow the top soil to dry out between waterings. Requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot, mimicking its native habitat where rainfall is intermittent or well-drained by volcanic substrates. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dubautia or na'ena'e is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. The genus was named after Joseph Eugène DuBaut (1796–1832), an officer in the French Navy who participated in Freycinet's expedition.
The entire genus is endemic to Hawaii. It contains more species than the other two genera in the silversword alliance, including cushion plants, shrubs, trees, and lianas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Shrubland Dubautia prefers full to partial sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native Hawaiian shrubland habitat. Water moderately, letting the soil dry between waterings, and provide light to moderate fertilization during its growth phase. This strategy supports healthy growth while preventing over-saturation or nutrient excess.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to Moderate fertilization during active growth; use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer. Adaptations to volcanic soils suggest it can tolerate nutrient-lean conditions but benefits from occasional replenishment.
