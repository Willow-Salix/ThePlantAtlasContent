## 🧤 Care Instructions
Horseradish is a resilient plant best grown in full sun with consistently moist, fertile soil. Regular watering and annual fertilization with organic matter or a balanced feed will ensure strong growth and high-quality root production, making it a straightforward addition to temperate gardens.
