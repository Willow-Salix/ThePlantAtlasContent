| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland and Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring brighter conditions for best flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during its active growing season (winter and spring), allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerates dry conditions in summer once established, as it often goes dormant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pholistoma is a small genus of flowering plants in the borage family known generally as fiestaflowers. There are three species, all native to a section of western North America between Oregon and Baja California. They are fleshy annual herbs producing angled bristly or prickly stems with several brittle branches. The deeply lobed, bristly leaves are borne on winged petioles that clasp the stem at their bases. The plants bear rotate flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white depending on species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To mimic its native Mediterranean climate, provide this plant with full sun to partial shade and ensure well-drained soil. Water moderately during its winter to spring growing period, then allow it to dry out considerably as it enters summer dormancy. Fertilizer needs are low, reflecting its adaptation to naturally lean environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to minimal; it is adapted to naturally lean soils. A very light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring may benefit potted plants but is generally not necessary for garden plants.
