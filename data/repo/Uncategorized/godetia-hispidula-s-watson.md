## 🧤 Care Instructions
Valley Godetia thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, indicative of its native Mediterranean climate. It requires moderate water during its spring growth but is drought-tolerant and prefers dry conditions during its summer dormancy. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to less nutrient-rich soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to less nutrient-rich soils; excessive fertilization can harm the plant. A light, balanced fertilizer or compost in early spring is generally sufficient, or none if soil is moderately fertile.
