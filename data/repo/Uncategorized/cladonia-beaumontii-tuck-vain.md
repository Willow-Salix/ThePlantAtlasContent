# Beaumont's Cup Lichen
### *Cladonia beaumontii (Tuck.) Vain.*

![Beaumont's Cup Lichen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/CladoniaSpec01.jpg)

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate to Subtropical Woodland/Coastal Plain. Characterized by sandy soils, open pine forests, warm humid summers, and mild winters. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Avoid direct, intense sunlight, especially during the hottest parts of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high ambient humidity and frequent moisture from misting or rainfall, rather than direct soil watering. Allow to dry slightly between hydration cycles to prevent rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations.
Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).
Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.
Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dunes, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.
Larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes continuella, feed on Cladonia species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in high humidity and bright indirect light, mimicking its native southeastern U.S. woodland habitat. Provide moisture through frequent misting rather than direct watering, and avoid all traditional fertilizers, as they can be detrimental to its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is needed or recommended. Lichens are sensitive to high nutrient levels and atmospheric pollutants, deriving nutrients from their environment.
