## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Mountains and Piedmont region (e.g., North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate Forest (Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forest) |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to dappled sun, especially protection from intense afternoon sun, mimicking its growth as an understory plant or at forest edges. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular watering is essential, particularly during dry spells, to reflect its native habitat's consistent rainfall, but avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rhododendron (; pl.: rhododendra), from Ancient Greek ῥόδον (rhódon), meaning "rose", and δένδρον (déndron), meaning "tree", is a very large genus of about 1,024 species of woody plants in the heath family (Ericaceae). They can be either evergreen or deciduous. Most species are native to eastern Asia and the Himalayan region, but smaller numbers occur elsewhere in Asia, and in North America, Europe and Australia.
It is the national flower of Nepal, the state flower of Washington and West Virginia in the United States, the state flower of Nagaland and Himachal Pradesh in India, the provincial flower of Jeju Province in South Korea, the provincial flower of Jiangxi in China and the state tree of Sikkim and Uttarakhand in India. Most species have brightly coloured flowers which bloom from late winter through to early summer.
Azaleas make up two subgenera of Rhododendron. They are distinguished from "true" rhododendrons by having only five anthers per flower.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Piedmont Rhododendron thrives in environments mimicking its native Appalachian forests, preferring partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained, acidic soil. Provide regular watering, especially during dry periods, and apply a light, acid-forming fertilizer in spring to maintain optimal health and growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with an acid-forming fertilizer designed for rhododendrons and azaleas, typically in early spring. Its native forest soils are generally acidic and rich in organic matter from leaf litter.
