## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Mexico and Central America (e.g., Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica), extending into parts of the Caribbean (e.g., Cuba). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical with seasonal rainfall, typically warm and humid. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. This fruit tree thrives in direct sunlight, mirroring its exposure in open tropical landscapes. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular and consistent watering, especially during dry seasons and when actively growing or fruiting, to mimic tropical rainfall patterns. Allow soil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pouteria sapota,  the mamey sapote, is a species of tree native to Central America and southern Mexico. It is now cultivated throughout Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, as well as in Florida and parts of South America. Its fruit is eaten raw in many Latin American countries, and is added to smoothies, milkshakes, ice cream, and other foods.
Some of its names in Latin American countries, such as mamey colorado (Cuba), zapote colorado (Costa Rica) and zapote rojo (South America), refer to the reddish colour of its flesh to distinguish it from the unrelated but similar-looking Mammea americana, whose fruit is usually called "yellow mamey" (Spanish: mamey amarillo).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Mamey Sapote requires a warm, tropical-like environment with full sun exposure. It needs consistent moisture, particularly during dry periods, and benefits from regular fertilization to support its growth and prolific fruiting. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high nutrient needs. Benefits from regular applications of a balanced fertilizer, especially one formulated for fruit trees, during the growing season to support robust growth and fruit production in often fertile but sometimes leached tropical soils.
