## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lopadium vulpinum is a lichen that thrives in cool, humid, and well-ventilated environments with indirect light, mimicking its native old-growth forest habitat. Avoid direct sun, traditional soil, and fertilizers; instead, focus on maintaining high ambient humidity and occasional misting to allow for moisture absorption.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers. This lichen absorbs nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rain) and the substrate it grows on. Fertilizers can be harmful.
