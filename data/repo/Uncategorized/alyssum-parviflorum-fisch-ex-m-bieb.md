## 🌱 Overview
Alyssum is a genus of over a hundred species of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, native to temperate Europe, Asia, and northern Africa, with the highest species diversity in the Mediterranean region. The genus comprises annual and perennial herbaceous plants or (rarely) small shrubs, growing to 10–100 cm tall, with oblong-oval leaves. Alyssum flowers are characteristically small and grouped in terminal clusters; they are often yellow or white colored but can be pink or purple.
The genera Lobularia, Aurinia and Odontarrhena are closely related to Alyssum and were formerly included in it. The widely cultivated species popularly known as "sweet alyssum" (Alyssum maritimum) is Lobularia maritima. The common rockery plant (Alyssum saxatile) is Aurinia saxatilis.
Alyssum foliage is used as food by the caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera, including the Gem (Orthonama obstipata). However, rabbits will not eat it.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy plant prefers full sun and dry conditions, reflecting its native steppe environment. It requires minimal watering once established and thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soil without the need for heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils; over-fertilization can reduce flowering and promote leggy growth.
