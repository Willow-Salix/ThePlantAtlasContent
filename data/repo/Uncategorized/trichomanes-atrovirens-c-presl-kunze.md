## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeast Asia (e.g., Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia) and Pacific Islands |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Deep shade to very low light; absolutely no direct sun. Prefers dappled or indirect light levels found on a rainforest floor. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist substrate and extremely high ambient humidity (80-90% or higher); never allow to dry out. Best suited for terrarium or vivarium culture to maintain humidity. |

## 🌱 Overview
Trichomanes is a genus of ferns in the family Hymenophyllaceae, termed bristle ferns. The circumscription of the genus is disputed. All ferns in the genus are filmy ferns, with leaf tissue typically 2 cells thick.  This thinness generally necessitates a permanently humid habitat, and makes the fronds somewhat translucent. Because of this membrane-like frond tissue, the plant is prone to drying out. "Filmy ferns" in the taxa Hymenophyllaceae grow in constantly wet environments. Many are found in cloud forests such as "Choco" in Colombia. There are also members of the taxa that can grow submersed in water. 
The name bristle fern refers to the small bristle that protrudes from the indusia of these ferns.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Dark Bristle Fern, a true tropical rainforest inhabitant, demands exceptional humidity and constant moisture to thrive. It requires very low light conditions, mimicking its natural understory habitat, and is highly sensitive to dryness and strong light. Optimal care involves a closed terrarium environment to maintain the critical humidity levels this delicate fern needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very light feeding, if any. Use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/8 to 1/4 strength) once a month during the growing season, or none if grown epiphytically with decaying organic matter. Sensitive to over-fertilization.
