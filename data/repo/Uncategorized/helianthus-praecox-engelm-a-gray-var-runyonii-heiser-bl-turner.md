## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South Central United States (primarily Texas) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Prairie |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), consistent with its open prairie habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate and regular watering during the growing season; allow soil to dry slightly between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, but performs best with consistent moisture, reflecting natural rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Helianthus () is a genus comprising around 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the daisy family Asteraceae commonly known as sunflowers. Except for three South American species, the species of Helianthus are native to North America and Central America. The best-known species is the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus). This and other species, notably Jerusalem artichoke (H. tuberosus), are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions, as food crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants. The species H. annuus typically grows during the summer and into early fall, with the peak growth season being mid-summer.
Several perennial Helianthus species are grown in gardens, but have a tendency to spread rapidly and can become aggressive.  On the other hand, the whorled sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus, was listed as an endangered species in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule protecting it under the Endangered Species Act. The primary threats to this species are industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. They grow to 1.8 metres (6 feet) and are primarily found in woodlands, adjacent to creeks and moist, prairie-like areas.
The common sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine, cultivated there for several centuries.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Runyon's Sunflower flourishes in full sun and well-draining, fertile soil, typical of its native Texas prairies. It requires moderate, consistent watering during its growth and bloom periods, and benefits from regular fertilization to support its robust development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high fertilization during the growing season, especially when flowering. Benefits from rich, well-draining soil, indicative of fertile grassland soils.
