# Stroganowia
### *Stroganowia Kar. & Kir.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Asia (e.g., Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan) and Southern Siberia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Steppe / Cold Semi-Arid. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, preferring open, bright conditions typical of steppe environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings; highly drought-tolerant once established due to adaptation to arid regions. Water infrequently but deeply. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stroganowia thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring infrequent, deep watering due to its native semi-arid environment. It is generally low-maintenance regarding nutrients, requiring only sparse fertilization during its growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate needs. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/early summer) as steppe soils can vary in richness.
