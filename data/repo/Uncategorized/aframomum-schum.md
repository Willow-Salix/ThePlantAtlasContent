## 🧤 Care Instructions
Aframomum thrives in warm, humid conditions with consistent soil moisture and indirect light, characteristic of tropical rainforests. Ensure well-draining, nutrient-rich soil and protect it from direct, intense sunlight.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding during the growing season with a balanced, slow-release or liquid fertilizer, due to the nutrient-rich organic matter found in its native habitat.
