## 🌱 Overview
Tradescantia () is a genus of 85 species of herbaceous perennial wildflowers in the family Commelinaceae, native to the Americas from southern Canada to northern Argentina, including the West Indies. Members of the genus are known by many common names, including inchplant, wandering jew, spiderwort, dayflower and trad.
Tradescantia grow 30–60 cm  tall (1–2 ft), and are commonly found individually or in clumps in wooded areas and open fields. They were introduced into Europe as ornamental plants in the 17th century and are now grown in many parts of the world. Some species have become naturalized in regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and on some oceanic islands.
The genus's many species are of interest to cytogenetics because of evolutionary changes in the structure and number of their chromosomes. They have also been used as bioindicators for the detection of environmental mutagens. Some species have become pests to cultivated crops and considered invasive.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hairystem Spiderwort thrives in bright, indirect light or partial shade, reminiscent of its native humid subtropical woodland edges. Provide consistent moisture during the growing season, ensuring well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Light fertilization will support healthy growth, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant when its specific needs are met.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during spring and summer, or at half-strength every few weeks. Reduce or stop fertilization in fall and winter.
