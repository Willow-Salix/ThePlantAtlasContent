## 🌱 Overview
Botrychium is a genus of ferns, seedless vascular plants in the family Ophioglossaceae. Botrychium species are known as moonworts. They are small, with fleshy roots, and reproduce by spores shed into the air. One part of the leaf, the trophophore, is sterile and fernlike; the other, the sporophore, is fertile and carries the clusters of sporangia or spore cases.  Some species only occasionally emerge above ground and gain most of their nourishment from an association with mycorrhizal fungi.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Ternate Grapefern thrives in temperate conditions with partial sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It prefers regular watering during its growing season and benefits from light fertilization. Avoid direct midday sun and waterlogging to ensure healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder. A diluted balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) can be applied once or twice during the growing season (spring/early summer). Over-fertilization should be avoided.
