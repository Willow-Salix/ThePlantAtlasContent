| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to semi-arid scrubland, grasslands, and pinyon-juniper woodlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in environments with at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its open habitat. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pursh's Bindweed is a hardy plant best suited for dry, sunny environments mimicking its native Western U.S. scrublands. Provide full sun exposure and ensure excellent drainage, watering only when the soil is completely dry as it is highly drought-tolerant. Minimal fertilization is needed, making it a low-maintenance option for xeric gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to lean, rocky soils, it generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial but is often not necessary.
