## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wright's milkpea thrives in full sun and requires infrequent watering due to its native arid climate. It is a drought-tolerant plant that generally needs minimal fertilization, benefiting from lean, well-draining soil to mimic its natural environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it can fix atmospheric nitrogen. Use a very light, balanced fertilizer sparingly if desired, primarily in poor soils.
