## 🧤 Care Instructions
This golden currant variety flourishes in conditions mirroring its native Mediterranean climate, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering during its active growing season but is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing very little water in summer. Minimal fertilization is typically sufficient, as it adapts well to average soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in average to poor soils without heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is sufficient if growth appears weak.
