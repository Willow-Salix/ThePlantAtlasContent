## 🌱 Overview
Keckiella is a genus of plants in the plantain family. It includes several species of plants known commonly as keckiellas. A few species may be called beardtongues or penstemons because all keckiellas once belonged to genus Penstemon as the section Hesperothamnus. Keckiellas are native to the American southwest, especially California. They bloom in attractive snapdragon-like flowers. Genus Keckiella was named after the American botanist David D. Keck.
Species:

Keckiella antirrhinoides - snapdragon penstemon, yellow bush snapdragon
Keckiella breviflora - bush beardtongue, gaping beardtongue
Keckiella cordifolia - heartleaf keckiella, climbing penstemon
Keckiella corymbosa - redwood keckiella
Keckiella lemmonii - Lemmon's keckiella
Keckiella rothrockii - Rothrock's keckiella, Rothrock's penstemon

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant California native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its chaparral habitat. Provide moderate water during its active growing season in cooler months, significantly reducing it during hot, dry summers. It prefers lean to moderately fertile soil, requiring minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring or fall can be beneficial, but avoid over-fertilizing.
