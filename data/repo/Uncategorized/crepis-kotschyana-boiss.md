| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mountainous regions of the Middle East, including Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Steppe/Rocky Slopes |

## 🌱 Overview
Crepis, commonly known in some parts of the world as hawksbeard or hawk's-beard (but not to be confused with the related genus Hieracium with a similar common name), is a genus of annual and perennial flowering plants of the family Asteraceae superficially resembling the dandelion, the most conspicuous difference being that Crepis usually has branching scapes with multiple heads (though solitary heads can occur). The genus name Crepis derives from the Greek krepis, meaning "slipper" or "sandal", possibly in reference to the shape of the fruit.
The genus is distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and Africa, and several plants are known as introduced species practically worldwide. The center of diversity is in the Mediterranean.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in full sun with well-drained soil, mimicking its native rocky slopes. Water regularly but ensure the soil dries between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly to avoid nutrient excess.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor rocky soils. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
