## 🧤 Care Instructions
Drummond's mountain-avens requires full sun, excellent drainage, and lean soil to mimic its native alpine environment. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and avoid rich soils or excessive fertilization to ensure healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Naturally grows in lean, mineral-rich, gravelly, or rocky soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental; a very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer might be considered only if growth is severely lacking.
