## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern temperate and boreal regions, including parts of Europe (e.g., Fennoscandia, Central Europe), North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes region), and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Coniferous Forest / Boreal Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light; thrives in shaded understories, avoiding direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high humidity and a moist substrate (decaying wood or bark); relies heavily on atmospheric moisture and consistent dampness. Do not allow to dry out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chaenotheca is a genus of lichenized fungi within the family Coniocybaceae. The sexual reproduction structures are a mass of loose ascospores that are enclosed by a cup shaped exciple sitting on top of a tiny stalk, having the appearance of a dressmaker's pin (called a mazaedium), hence the common name pin lichen. Genus members are also commonly called needle lichens. Photobiont partners for Chaenotheca include members of the algae genera Symbiochloris, Trebouxia, Trentepohlia, and Tritostichococcus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Needle lichen thrives in cool, highly humid environments with very low to indirect light. It requires a consistently moist substrate and high atmospheric humidity, while supplemental fertilizer is unnecessary and potentially detrimental to its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient needs; supplemental fertilizer is generally not required and can be harmful. Obtains necessary nutrients from the environment (air, rain, substrate).
