## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in temperate and boreal forest regions across North America, Europe, and Asia, often found in old-growth forests. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Boreal Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate indirect light. Prefers dappled shade or filtered light, avoiding direct harsh sunlight which can desiccate it. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity is essential. Requires consistent moisture from ambient humidity and occasional misting or rainfall, allowing for periods of drying between moistening events to prevent rot. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Microcalicium is a genus  of lichen-forming fungi in the order Pertusariales. It is the only genus in the monotypic family Microcaliciaceae. These taxa were circumscribed by the Finnish lichenologist Edvard August Vainio in 1927, with Microcalicium disseminatum assigned as the type species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Microcalicium lichens thrive in high humidity and low to moderate indirect light, mimicking their native temperate boreal forest habitats. They absorb moisture and nutrients directly from the air, so regular misting or humid conditions are vital, while traditional fertilizers should be entirely avoided.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens derive their minimal nutrient needs from the air and their substrate; traditional fertilizers are not only unnecessary but can be harmful.
