## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lapalapa thrives in conditions mimicking its native Hawaiian wet forests, requiring bright, indirect light, consistently moist well-draining soil, and high humidity. Protect it from intense direct sun and provide moderate fertilization during its growing period for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in the fall and winter.
