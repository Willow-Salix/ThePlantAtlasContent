## 🌱 Overview
Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) or common buckwheat is a flowering plant in the knotweed family Polygonaceae cultivated for its grain-like seeds and as a cover crop. Buckwheat cultivation originated around the 6th millennium BC in the region of what is now Yunnan Province in southwestern China. The name "buckwheat" is used for several other species, such as Fagopyrum tataricum, a domesticated food plant raised in Asia.
Despite its name, buckwheat is not closely related to wheat, nor is it a cereal or a member of the grass family. It is related to sorrel, knotweed, and rhubarb. Buckwheat is considered a pseudocereal because the high starch content of the seeds enables buckwheat to be cooked and consumed like a cereal.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wild buckwheat thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its native high desert habitat in Utah. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping. Avoid over-fertilization and ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nutrient needs. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, typically once a year in spring with a low-nitrogen formula.
