## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in exposed, open scrubland habitats without significant tree canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low watering once established; it is highly drought-tolerant, adapted to hot, dry summers and relying on winter rains. Overwatering can be detrimental. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Rainbow Manzanita thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean scrubland environment. Once established, it requires very little water and is highly drought-tolerant, making it an excellent low-maintenance choice. Avoid excessive watering and fertilizing to ensure optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Manzanitas are adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils and can be sensitive to excess phosphorus.
