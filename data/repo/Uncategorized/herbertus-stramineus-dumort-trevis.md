## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort thrives in cool, consistently humid environments with low, indirect light and a constantly moist, acidic substrate. Avoid direct sun and ensure high ambient humidity, as drying out is detrimental. Fertilization should be kept to an absolute minimum or avoided entirely.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
