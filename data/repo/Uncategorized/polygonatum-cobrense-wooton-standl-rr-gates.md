## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with consistently moist, well-drained, and organically rich soil, much like its native montane woodland habitat. Ensure it is protected from harsh direct sunlight and receives regular watering, particularly during its active growth period, to support its lush foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from organically rich soil. Amend with compost or apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring.
