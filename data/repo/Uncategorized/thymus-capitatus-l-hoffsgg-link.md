## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Basin (including Southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of the Middle East) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), consistent with its native open, sunny habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, reflecting its adaptation to dry Mediterranean summers. Highly drought-tolerant once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
The thymus (pl.: thymuses or thymi) is a specialized primary lymphoid organ of the immune system. Within the thymus, T cells mature. T cells are critical to the adaptive immune system, where the body adapts to specific foreign invaders. The thymus is located in the  upper front part of the chest, in the anterior superior mediastinum, behind the sternum, and in front of the heart. It is made up of two lobes, each consisting of a central medulla and an outer cortex, surrounded by a capsule.
The thymus is made up of immature T cells called thymocytes, as well as lining cells called epithelial cells which help the thymocytes develop. T cells that successfully develop react appropriately with MHC immune receptors of the body (called positive selection) and not against proteins of the body (called negative selection). The thymus is the largest and most active during the neonatal and pre-adolescent periods.  By the early teens, the thymus begins to decrease in size and activity and the tissue of the thymus is gradually replaced by fatty tissue.  Nevertheless, some T cell development continues throughout adult life.
Abnormalities of the thymus can result in a decreased number of T cells and autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 and myasthenia gravis. These are often associated with cancer of the tissue of the thymus, called thymoma, or tissues arising from immature lymphocytes such as T cells, called lymphoma. Removal of the thymus is called a thymectomy. Although the thymus has been identified as a part of the body since the time of the Ancient Greeks, it is only since the 1960s that the function of the thymus in the immune system has become clearer.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Conehead Thyme thrives in conditions mimicking its Mediterranean origin, requiring full sun and exceptionally well-drained soil. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering, and performs best with minimal to no fertilization. The primary care strategy is to avoid overwatering and ensure ample direct sunlight.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; its native soils are often lean. If necessary, a very light, balanced fertilizer in spring, but generally thrives in nutrient-poor conditions.
