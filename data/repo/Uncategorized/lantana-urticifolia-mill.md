## 🌱 Overview
Lantana () is a genus of about 150 species of perennial flowering plants in the verbena family, Verbenaceae. They are native to tropical regions of the Americas and Africa but exist as an introduced species in numerous areas, especially in the Australian-Pacific region, South and Northeastern part of India. The genus includes both herbaceous plants and shrubs growing to 0.5–2 m (1.6–6.6 ft) tall. Their common names are shrub verbenas or lantanas. The generic name originated in Late Latin, where it refers to the unrelated Viburnum lantana.
Lantana's aromatic flower clusters (called umbels) are a mix of red, orange, yellow, or blue and white florets. Other colors exist as new varieties are being selected. The flowers typically change color as they mature, resulting in inflorescences that are two- or three-colored.
"Wild lantanas" are plants of the unrelated genus Abronia, usually called "sand-verbenas".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Nettleleaf Shrubverbena flourishes in full sun and well-draining soil, adapting well to its native tropical and subtropical dry habitats. Water thoroughly when the soil is dry during the growing season, reducing frequency in cooler months. Fertilize sparingly to promote abundant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season. Tolerant of moderately fertile to poor soils.
