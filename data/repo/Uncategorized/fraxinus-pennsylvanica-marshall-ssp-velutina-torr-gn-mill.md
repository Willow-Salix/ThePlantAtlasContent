## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Velvet Ash thrives in full sun, adapting well to arid and semi-arid climates due to its native habitat along watercourses. It requires regular watering during establishment but becomes quite drought-tolerant once mature. Minimal fertilization is generally sufficient for its robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring can benefit young or stressed trees.
