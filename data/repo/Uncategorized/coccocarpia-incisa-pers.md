## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of the Neotropics, including parts of Central and South America (e.g., Brazil, Colombia) and the Caribbean. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect light to partial shade. As an epiphyte growing under dense forest canopies, it requires protection from direct, intense sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity and consistent moisture. Requires frequent misting or a terrarium-like environment to maintain high atmospheric moisture, mimicking tropical rainfall patterns. Avoid complete drying out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Coccocarpia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Coccocarpiaceae. Recent genetic studies suggest the genus originated in the Australasia–Oceania region during the Late Cretaceous period, roughly 76–100 million years ago, and later spread to Asia and the Americas. Some South American lineages are thought to have reached the continent via warm rainforest corridors that crossed Antarctica during the Palaeogene period, around 50–60 million years ago.
The genus is far more diverse than previously recognised, with ongoing research indicating it may contain over 200 species, and possibly more than 300, as many familiar names actually represent multiple distinct evolutionary lineages that are morphologically similar. These lichens typically grow as leaf-like structures in humid tropical forests around the world, with most species displaying a dull blue-grey upper surface and reddish-brown to nearly black disc-shaped fruiting bodies. Unlike many lichens that partner with green algae, Coccocarpia species associate with cyanobacteria of the genus Rhizonema.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical lichen thrives in very high humidity and indirect light, replicating its native rainforest environment. Ensure consistent atmospheric moisture through frequent misting and avoid direct sun. No conventional fertilization is needed, as it acquires nutrients from the air and water.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Lichens absorb nutrients primarily from the air and rainwater, making conventional fertilization unnecessary and potentially harmful.
