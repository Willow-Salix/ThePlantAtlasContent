## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Arnold's Hawthorn prefers full sun and consistent moisture, mirroring its native temperate forest environment. It is a hardy, relatively low-maintenance plant once established, requiring minimal fertilization in average soils. Ensure good drainage to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally a low to moderate feeder. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, particularly for young plants or those in poor soil.
