## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wetland grass thrives in consistently moist to wet soil conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade. Mimic its native montane wetland environment by providing ample water and moderate light. Fertilizer needs are low, as it is adapted to its natural habitat's nutrient levels.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer. As a native wetland grass, it is adapted to its natural environment's nutrient levels. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer or addition of organic matter once a year in spring should suffice if growth appears sluggish.
