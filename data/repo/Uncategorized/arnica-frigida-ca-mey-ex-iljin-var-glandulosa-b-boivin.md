## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and Subarctic North America (e.g., Alaska, Yukon, Northwest Territories, British Columbia, Alberta) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to bright indirect light. Requires significant light exposure due to lack of overhead canopy in its native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate and consistent moisture. Ensure well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging, mimicking the often rocky, meltwater-fed but not saturated conditions of its native tundra. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arnica angustifolia is an Arctic and alpine species of plants in the sunflower family, known by the common names narrowleaf arnica and Arctic arnica. It is native to colder regions in Europe, Asia, and North America (northern and western Canada, Alaska, northern Rocky Mountains).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arctic variety of Arnica thrives in cool climates with ample light. Provide full sun and ensure consistently moist, well-draining soil, avoiding both drought and waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, reflecting the nutrient-poor conditions of its native tundra.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Alpine soils are typically lean; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be used sparingly during the growing season.
