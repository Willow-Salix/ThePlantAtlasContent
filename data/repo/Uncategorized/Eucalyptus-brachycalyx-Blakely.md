## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Australian native thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established, preferring well-drained soils. Avoid over-watering and excessive fertilization, especially with high phosphorus, to ensure healthy growth in conditions mimicking its arid to semi-arid homeland.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low-nutrient needs; native soils are typically poor. Avoid high phosphorus fertilizers, which can be detrimental to Australian native plants. Fertilize sparingly with a low-phosphorus, slow-release formula only if growth is poor.
