## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | White Mountains, New Hampshire and Maine, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra (specifically subalpine/alpine rocky slopes) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring direct sunlight for most of the day due to its native exposed, high-altitude habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate; prefers well-drained soil and tolerates dry conditions between waterings, mimicking quick-draining rocky slopes and periods of meltwater followed by dryness. |

## 🌱 Overview
Paronychia is an inflammation of the skin around the nail, often due to bacteria or fungi.  
Its sudden (acute) occurrence is usually due to the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Gradual (chronic) occurrences are typically caused by fungi, commonly Candida albicans. 
Risk factors for paronychia include frequent hand washing and trauma to the cuticle, such as from chronic nail biting or hangnails.
Treatment typically involves antibiotics for bacterial infections and antifungals for fungal infections. If there is pus formation, incision and drainage may be necessary.
Paronychia is commonly mistakenly used interchangeably with herpetic whitlow or felon, which are distinct conditions.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soil, typical of its rocky mountain home. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid rich fertilizers to mimic its natural environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor, rocky soils characteristic of its native habitat and generally does not require significant fertilization.
