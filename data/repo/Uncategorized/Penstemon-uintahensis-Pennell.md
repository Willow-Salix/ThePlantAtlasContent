## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native subalpine habitat: full sun, well-drained soil, and moderate water once established. Avoid overwatering and excessive fertilization, as it prefers lean conditions and is adapted to natural rainfall and snowmelt patterns.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Rich soils or excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering in these high-altitude adapted plants.
