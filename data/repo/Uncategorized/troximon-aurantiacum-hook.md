### *Troximon aurantiacum Hook.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (including diverse regions across Canada and the United States, from British Columbia south to Arizona and New Mexico, and east to the Dakotas) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Mountain/Alpine Meadow and Subalpine Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in full sun exposure, typical of open mountain meadows and clearings. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, particularly during its active growing season (spring through early summer). Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Orange Agoseris is a hardy perennial best suited for full sun in well-drained soil, reflecting its native mountain meadow habitat. It requires consistent moisture during its growing period but is intolerant of waterlogged conditions. Fertilization should be minimal, supporting its natural adaptation to moderately rich soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in moderately fertile soils without requiring heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if the soil is poor.
