## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (including Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, South Dakota) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Tundra, Montane Meadows, and Open Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun, especially in higher elevation environments. Can tolerate partial shade in open woodlands. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist but very well-drained soil, characteristic of alpine meadows and rocky slopes fed by snowmelt. Avoid prolonged waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in cool, exposed environments typical of Western North American mountains. Provide full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native alpine and subalpine habitats. It requires minimal fertilization, adapting well to lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. Thrives in lean, rocky soils. A light, balanced fertilizer application once a year in spring is sufficient if soil is poor.
