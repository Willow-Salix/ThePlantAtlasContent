## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in temperate regions, particularly Western Europe (e.g., British Isles, Scandinavia) and parts of North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Maritime |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Sun (at least 6 hours of direct light preferred), often found in exposed situations. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity and regular moisture from rain or mist are essential. Lichens absorb water directly from the air and precipitation; avoid prolonged standing water and allow the lichen to dry between moistening cycles. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pertusaria is a large genus of warty crustose lichens in the Pertusariaceae family. The fruiting bodies are usually modified apothecia that immersed in warts on the main body (thallus) with small holes for the spores to emerge, similar to ostioles, or are fully above and lecanorine (spore bearing discs surrounded by a ring of tissue similar to the tissue of the thallus.  Members of the genus are commonly called wart lichens.
The widespread genus contains over 500 species.
Classification in the large genus relies heavily on thallus chemistry to distinguish and classify species, some of which differ only in the presence or absence of a single secondary chemical. Lichexanthone, norlichexanthone, and their chlorinated derivatives are common in this genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pore Lichen thrives in cool, moist temperate maritime conditions with good air circulation, preferring significant light exposure found on exposed rocks or tree bark. It requires high ambient humidity and regular moisture from rainfall, absorbing nutrients naturally without the need for fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air, rain, and the substrate. Traditional fertilizers can be harmful.
