## 🌱 Overview
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bryum Moss requires a consistently moist and humid environment with partial shade, replicating its native subarctic bog habitat. It has very low nutrient needs and must never dry out, making a terrarium or specialized bog garden suitable for cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Mosses thrive in nutrient-poor conditions, and high levels of fertilizers can be detrimental.
