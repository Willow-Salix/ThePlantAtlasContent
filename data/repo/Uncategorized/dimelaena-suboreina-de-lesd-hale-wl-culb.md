| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and alpine regions, including Greenland, Fennoscandia, North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada), and other mountainous areas globally. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure, tolerant of cold temperatures and strong winds. Should be protected from extreme heat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent but thorough rehydration periods, allowing complete drying between moisture events. Requires high air humidity or direct rainfall/snowmelt when active. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arctic-alpine lichen thrives in high sun exposure with cold temperatures and strong winds. It requires infrequent but thorough rehydration, followed by complete drying, as it is poikilohydric. Nutrient needs are met by the environment, making additional fertilization unnecessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely minimal to none; this lichen derives nutrients primarily from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust) and its rock substrate.
