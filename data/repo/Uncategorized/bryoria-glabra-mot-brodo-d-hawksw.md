## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including North America (especially Pacific Northwest, Canada, Alaska), Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate and Boreal Forests (typically coniferous or mixed forests), characterized by high humidity, frequent precipitation, and cool temperatures. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to filtered light, mimicking its natural growth on tree branches under a forest canopy. Direct, intense sunlight should be avoided as it can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and frequent moisture from misting or ambient precipitation (rain, fog). Lichens absorb water directly from the air and surfaces, not via roots; prolonged dry periods are detrimental. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bryoria is a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. Many members of this genus are known as horsehair lichens. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in boreal and cool temperate areas. These lichens typically grow as slender, hair-like strands that hang from conifer trees or form small bushes, ranging in colour from dark brown to pale grey. They play important ecological roles, particularly as winter food for caribou in northern forests, where some species can accumulate in large quantities in the forest canopy. The genus contains about 35 species found worldwide, with ongoing discoveries of new species especially in mountainous regions of Asia and western North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, highly humid environments with clean air and filtered light. It demands consistent atmospheric moisture and is unsuited for typical indoor plant care due to its unique biological needs. Fertilization is neither necessary nor beneficial.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens acquire necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust, organic particles). Artificial fertilization can be harmful and lead to nutrient imbalances or pollution sensitivity.
