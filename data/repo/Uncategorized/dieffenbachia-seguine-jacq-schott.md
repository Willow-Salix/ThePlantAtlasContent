## 🌱 Overview
Dieffenbachia , commonly known as dumb cane or leopard lily, is a genus of tropical flowering plants  in the family Araceae. It is native to the New World Tropics from Mexico and the West Indies south to Argentina. Some species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants, especially as houseplants, and have become naturalized on a few tropical islands.
Dieffenbachia is a perennial herbaceous plant with straight stem, simple and alternate leaves containing white spots and flecks, making it attractive as indoor foliage. Species in this genus are popular as houseplants because of their tolerance of shade. The English names, dumb cane and mother-in-law's tongue (also used for Sansevieria species) refer to the poisoning effect of raphides, which can cause temporary inability to speak. Dieffenbachia was named by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott, director of the Botanical Gardens in Vienna, to honor his head gardener Joseph Dieffenbach (1790–1863).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dumbcane thrives in conditions mirroring its tropical rainforest understory origins. Provide indirect bright light and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, allowing the top layer to dry slightly between waterings. High humidity and regular feeding during the growing season are essential for robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed monthly during spring and summer with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength, reflecting the rich but recycling nutrients of its native soil.
