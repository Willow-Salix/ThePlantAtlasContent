## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Borneo (Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei), Sumatra, and parts of the Philippines |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun when mature, tolerating partial shade in juvenile stages. As an emergent rainforest tree, it requires high light levels for optimal growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent and abundant moisture, mimicking high rainforest rainfall. The soil should be kept consistently damp but well-drained to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eusideroxylon is a genus of evergreen trees of the family Lauraceae. The genus is monotypic, and includes one accepted species, Eusideroxylon zwageri. It is known colloquially in English as Bornean ironwood, billian, or ulin.
It is native to Borneo and Sumatra, where it grows in lowland rain forests.
Eusideroxylon are hardwood trees reaching up to 50 metres in height with trunks over 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) in diameter, producing commercially valuable timber. The wood of E. zwageri is impervious to termites, and can last up to 100 years after being cut. Due to extensive logging, it is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This large tropical tree thrives in warm, humid conditions with abundant rainfall. Ensure it receives ample sunlight as it matures and is planted in consistently moist, well-draining soil, with regular fertilization to support its robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or organic matter, especially during active growth periods, to support its robust growth in nutrient-cycling tropical soils.
