## 🌱 Overview
Callitris is a genus of coniferous trees in the Cupressaceae (cypress family). There are 16 recognized species in the genus, of which 13 are native to Australia and the other three (C. neocaledonica, C. sulcata and C. pancheri) native to New Caledonia. Traditionally, the most widely used common name is cypress-pine, a name shared by some species of the closely related genus Actinostrobus. Alongside Eucalyptus, Callitris is one of the dominant tree genera in Australia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The White Cypress-Pine thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, reflecting its adaptation to arid Australian environments. It requires infrequent, deep watering and performs best in well-draining soil with minimal to no fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements. If grown in containers, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring may be beneficial, but generally not needed in ground.
