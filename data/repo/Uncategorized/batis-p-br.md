| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Coastal Salt Marsh/Mangrove/Beach environments. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. Thrives in direct, intense sunlight, consistent with its exposure in open coastal areas. |
| **💧 Water** | High water needs, requiring consistently moist to wet soil and tolerating frequent inundation. For long-term health, it prefers brackish or saline water conditions, replicating its native salt-tolerant habitat. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Turtleweed thrives in full, direct sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil, ideally with brackish or saline water to mimic its native coastal habitat. It is a resilient plant adapted to warm, humid environments, needing only moderate, infrequent fertilization to flourish.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate and infrequent. Native coastal sandy soils are not typically rich, so a balanced, dilute liquid fertilizer applied every few months during the growing season is generally sufficient.
