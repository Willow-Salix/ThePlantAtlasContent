## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hawthorn thrives in temperate climates, preferring full sun to partial shade conditions typical of forest edges. It requires moderate, consistent watering, allowing for slight drying between sessions, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Ensure well-draining soil for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally requires minimal fertilization in average to poor soils. A light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring can benefit growth in lean soils.
