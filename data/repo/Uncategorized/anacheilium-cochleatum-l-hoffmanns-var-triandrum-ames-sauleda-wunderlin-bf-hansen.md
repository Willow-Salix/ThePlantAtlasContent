## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Florida (USA), Caribbean (e.g., Cuba, Jamaica), Central America (e.g., Mexico, Belize, Guatemala), northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Venezuela) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. As an epiphyte, it thrives in the dappled light found under a forest canopy, avoiding direct midday sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **💧 Water** | Water regularly when the potting medium is nearly dry, typically every 4-7 days depending on conditions. Ensure good drainage, as these epiphytes do not like to sit in standing water. High humidity is beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Prosthechea is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family (Orchidaceae). The name is derived from the Greek word prostheke (appendix), referring to the appendage on the back of the column. Appendage orchid is a common name for this genus. Prosthechea is abbreviated Psh. in the horticultural trade.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This orchid requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture, allowing the roots to dry slightly between waterings. High humidity is preferred, mimicking its tropical forest home. Fertilize sparingly during active growth to support its epiphytic nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize lightly with a balanced orchid-specific fertilizer, diluted to half or quarter strength, every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Reduce or stop fertilizing during dormancy.
