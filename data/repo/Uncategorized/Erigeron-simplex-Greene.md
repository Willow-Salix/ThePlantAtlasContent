## 🧤 Care Instructions
Onestem Fleabane, an alpine native, requires full sun and thrives in cool, well-drained, lean soils. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly. Mimicking its mountainous habitat ensures optimal growth, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine beds.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils typical of alpine environments. Excessive fertilization can harm it. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, if desired, is more than sufficient.
