## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Puerto Rico and other Greater Antilles (West Indies) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest (understory) |
| **☀️ Light** | Low light to partial shade; direct sun will scorch the fronds. It thrives in filtered or dappled light conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the soil consistently moist but never waterlogged. High humidity is crucial, so regular misting or placement in a humid environment (e.g., terrarium) is highly recommended. |

## 🌱 Overview
Danaea is a fern genus of approximately 80 species in the eusporangiate fern family Marattiaceae. They are small to intermediately large ferns with erect or creeping rhizomes and usually once-pinnate leaves with opposite pinnae. The fertile leaves are contracted, acrostichoid and covered below with sunken, linear synangia. The genus Danaea has a neotropical distribution, occurring from southern Mexico through Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America to Bolivia, Paraguay and the Mata Atlantica in Brazil and Northern Argentina. There is also a population on Isla del Coco (Cocos Island) in the Pacific.
The genus name of Danaea is named after the Greek mythology, Danaë, an Argive princess and mother of the hero Perseus by Zeus.
Two species Danaea carillensis (Costa Rica) and D. simplicifolia (Guianas, Brazil, Trinidad) have simple, undivided leaves, and some other species sometimes have bipinnate leaves (D. atlantica, D. bipinnata, D. nodosa, D. urbanii). One species Danaea kalevala of the Lesser Antilles was named in honour of the Finnish heroic epic Kalevala.
The basal chromosome number for this genus is 2n=80. The type species is Danaea nodosa.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Forest Danafern, provide a consistently moist, well-draining soil medium and ensure very high ambient humidity, mimicking its native rainforest understory. Offer low to partial light, protecting it from any direct sun exposure to prevent leaf burn.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. Use a dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer). Avoid over-fertilizing.
