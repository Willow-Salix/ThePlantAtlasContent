## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient tree thrives in full sun and is exceptionally drought-tolerant once established, benefiting from moderate watering during its active growth period. It requires minimal fertilization, as it enriches the soil through nitrogen fixation, making it adaptable to various soil types found in its native habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen, improving soil fertility and thriving in poor soils without rich amendments.
