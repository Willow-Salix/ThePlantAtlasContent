## 🌱 Overview
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. Species are distributed widely – from Quebec to northern Argentina in the Americas, across northern and southern tropical Africa, in the southern Arabian Peninsula, in Myanmar and Thailand, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its arid and semi-arid native regions. Water sparingly once established, and provide minimal fertilization, leveraging its natural ability to fix nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so heavy nitrogen fertilization is unnecessary. A light application of a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer or compost in spring is sufficient, especially in poor soils.
