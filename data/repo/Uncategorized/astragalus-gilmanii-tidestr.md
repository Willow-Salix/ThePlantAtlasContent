## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gilman's milkvetch thrives in hot, dry conditions with abundant sunlight. Provide full sun exposure and infrequent, deep watering, ensuring the soil dries completely between waterings. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its adaptation to lean desert soils and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization is sufficient. As a legume, it can fix nitrogen, thriving in lean desert soils, so excessive fertilizer is not necessary and can be detrimental.
