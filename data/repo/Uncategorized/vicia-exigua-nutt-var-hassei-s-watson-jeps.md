## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hasse's Vetch thrives in full sun and well-draining soils, typical of its native Mediterranean climate. It requires moderate watering during its active winter-spring growth, then becomes drought-tolerant for the dry summer months. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has very low fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil itself. Supplemental fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental, especially high nitrogen.
