## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Pacific Islands, including Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Cook Islands, French Polynesia (e.g., Society Islands, Marquesas), and other central/south Pacific atolls and coasts. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Coastal / Insular Tropical |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it typically grows in open coastal areas and beaches. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings; it tolerates some drought once established, but thrives with regular moisture typical of tropical rainfall. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Boerhavia Tetrandra thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native tropical coastal environment. It requires moderate watering, tolerating some drought once established, and benefits from light, infrequent fertilization to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; light feeding once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, particularly given its native habitat in nutrient-poor sandy or rocky coastal soils.
