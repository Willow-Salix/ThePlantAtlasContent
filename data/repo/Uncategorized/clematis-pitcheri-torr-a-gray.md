| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |

| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Deciduous Forest transition zone, characterized by warm summers, cold winters, and moderate annual rainfall. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade (at least 6 hours of direct sun daily). Benefits from shading the root zone to keep it cool, mimicking its preference for woodland edges. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil, especially during active growth and flowering. Water regularly during dry periods, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. Tolerates short periods of drought once established. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bluebill Clematis thrives in temperate climates with full sun to partial shade, requiring consistently moist, well-draining soil, particularly at the roots. It benefits from moderate fertilization in spring and is relatively low-maintenance once established, adapting well to its native woodland edge and prairie environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate needs. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a layer of compost in early spring as new growth emerges. Avoid over-fertilization.
