## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (Nevada, Utah, Arizona, California) and Baja California, Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Montane Desert / Pinyon-Juniper Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low watering frequency; highly drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings, mimicking arid rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pinus monophylla, the single-leaf pinyon, (alternatively spelled piñon) is a pine in the pinyon pine group, native to North America. The range is in southernmost Idaho, western Utah, Arizona, southwest New Mexico, Nevada, eastern and southern California and northern Baja California.
It occurs at moderate altitudes from 1,200 to 2,300 m (3,900 to 7,500 ft), rarely as low as 950 m (3,120 ft) and as high as 2,900 m (9,500 ft). It is widespread and often abundant in this region, forming extensive open woodlands, often mixed with junipers in the Pinyon-juniper woodland plant community. Single-leaf pinyon is the world's only one-needled pine.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Singleleaf Pinyon thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, characteristic of its arid Western US origins. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and preferring dry conditions. Minimal to no fertilization is needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Native soils are typically lean and nutrient-poor, so established plants rarely require fertilization. If necessary, use a very mild, balanced, slow-release formula sparingly in spring.
