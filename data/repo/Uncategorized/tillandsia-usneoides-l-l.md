## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spanish Moss thrives in bright, indirect light to partial sun with high humidity, mimicking its native subtropical and tropical environments. It requires frequent watering by misting or soaking, ensuring thorough drying afterward to prevent rot, and benefits from minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very minimal; a highly diluted (1/4 strength) bromeliad or air plant specific fertilizer can be applied as a mist or soak once a month during active growing seasons. Primarily relies on natural airborne nutrients.
