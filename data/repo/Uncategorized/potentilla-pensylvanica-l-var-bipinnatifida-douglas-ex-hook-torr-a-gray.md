## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Western North America, including parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of Canada (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta) and the United States. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland (Prairie) and open, dry-mesic habitats. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. As a plant native to open prairies, it requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Native to prairies with periods of both rainfall and drought, it prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil during active growth, tolerating drier conditions once established. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bipinnate Cinquefoil thrives in full sun, mimicking its native open prairie habitat. It requires moderate watering, preferring well-drained soil that can dry out slightly between waterings, and is generally drought-tolerant once established. This hardy plant has low to moderate fertilizer needs, making it a relatively low-maintenance option for appropriate climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Prairie soils vary in richness, but this plant is adapted to moderate nutrient levels. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil is poor, otherwise, it may not require regular feeding.
