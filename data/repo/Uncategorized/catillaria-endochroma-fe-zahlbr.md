## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen needs a consistently humid environment and indirect light, mirroring its native tropical forest habitat. Ensure frequent moisture exposure through misting and protect it from any direct, harsh sunlight. Avoid traditional fertilizers, as they can be harmful to lichens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients directly from the air, rainwater, and their substrate; chemical fertilizers can be detrimental.
