## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in subtropical and tropical South America, including Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Dry Forests, Grasslands, and Savannas, characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Sun. It naturally occurs in open, exposed areas. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This South American native thrives in full to partial sun and well-draining soil, preferring subtropical to tropical dry environments. It is drought-tolerant but appreciates moderate watering during its active growing season, allowing soil to dry out between applications. Minimal fertilization is typically sufficient for healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. It can grow in relatively poor soils but benefits from light, balanced fertilization during its active growth phases.
