## 🌱 Overview
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).
