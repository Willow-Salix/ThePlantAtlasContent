## 🌱 Overview
Pisonia is a genus of flowering plants in the four o'clock flower family, Nyctaginaceae. It was named for Dutch physician and naturalist Willem Piso (1611–1678). Certain species in this genus are known as catchbirdtrees, birdcatcher trees or birdlime trees because they catch birds.  The sticky seeds are postulated to be an adaptation of some island species that ensures the dispersal of seeds between islands by attaching them to birds, and also allows the enriching of coralline sands.  (Should a fledgling fall to the ground, become entangled in the Pisonia's sticky seeds, and be unable to free itself, then it will starve, and so enrich the soil within the tree's rootzone.) These island species include P. brunoniana of Australasia and Polynesia and P. umbellifera, which is widespread in the tropical Indo-Pacific region.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical tree variety thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright indirect light. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from regular feeding during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease feeding during fall and winter.
