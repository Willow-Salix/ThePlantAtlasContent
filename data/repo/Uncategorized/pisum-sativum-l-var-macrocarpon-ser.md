## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Near East, Central Asia, and Mediterranean regions (ancestral species) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Steppe, Mediterranean (ancestral species and early cultivation areas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) as they are open-field crops not typically found under dense canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent and regular watering, especially critical during flowering and pod development. Soil should remain evenly moist but not waterlogged, mimicking temperate rainfall patterns during the growing season. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Snow peas thrive in full sun with consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Due to nitrogen fixation, they require minimal nitrogen fertilizer, focusing instead on phosphorus and potassium. Regular watering, particularly during flowering, is crucial for good pod development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nitrogen requirements due to their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Benefits from moderate phosphorus and potassium. Excessive nitrogen can promote leafy growth at the expense of pod production.
