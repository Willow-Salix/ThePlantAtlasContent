## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Montane Wet Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. As a dominant tree in its native habitat, it thrives in bright conditions but can tolerate some filtered light. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture, especially during active growth, but also excellent drainage. Water thoroughly when the topsoil begins to dry, then allow it to dry slightly before the next watering to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Metrosideros (; MET-roe-SID-uh-ruhs) is a genus of approximately 60 trees, shrubs, and vines in the family Myrtaceae, mostly found in the Pacific region. Most of the tree forms are small, but some are exceptionally large, the New Zealand species in particular. The name derives from the Ancient Greek metra or "heartwood" and sideron or "iron". Perhaps the best-known species are the pōhutukawa (M. excelsa), northern rātā (M. robusta) and southern rātā (M. umbellata) of New Zealand, and ʻōhiʻa lehua (M. polymorpha) from the Hawaiian Islands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This 'Ōhi'a Lehua variety thrives in bright conditions, from full sun to partial shade, and needs consistent moisture with excellent drainage. Mimic its native tropical wet forest environment by providing regular watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and offering moderate fertilization for robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or organic amendments, particularly during the growing season. Native volcanic soils can be mineral-rich but also lean, so supplemental nutrients are beneficial.
