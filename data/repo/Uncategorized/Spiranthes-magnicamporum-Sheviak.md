## 🧤 Care Instructions
This terrestrial orchid thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during its active growth period. Mimicking its native prairie habitat, it benefits from low to moderate, infrequent fertilization, ensuring proper drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly during the active growing season (e.g., once a month at half strength). Avoid over-fertilization.
