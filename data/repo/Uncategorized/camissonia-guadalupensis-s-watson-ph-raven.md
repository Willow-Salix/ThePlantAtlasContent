## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Guadalupe Island, Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is preferred, reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth (winter and spring), allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Significantly reduce or cease watering during its summer dormancy period. |

## 🌱 Overview
Camissonia, sometimes commonly known as sun cup or sundrop, is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the evening primrose family Onagraceae. A total of 12 species are known, nearly all from western North America, especially in the California Floristic Province, but also one from South America. Previous circumscriptions of the genus had recognized up to 62 species before it was split among other closely related genera.
The flowers generally open at dawn and are yellow. They are usually cup-shaped, thus the common name.
Formerly included in Oenothera, the species of Camissonia are distinguished by having a club- or head-shaped stigma, instead of the 4-part-divided stigma of Oenothera or Clarkia.
Camissonia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia cupes and Schinia deserticola, both of which feed on C. claviformis, the latter exclusively.
The genus is named after the botanist Adelbert von Chamisso.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Guadalupe Suncup thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its open island habitat. Water moderately during its winter-spring growing season, allowing for dry periods, and virtually withhold water during its summer dormancy. Keep fertilization to a minimum.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, diluted fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season, as native soils in its habitat are not typically rich.
