## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Montane Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring direct sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily, typical of open, high-elevation landscapes. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to very low; it is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between applications. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soil, mimicking its arid, montane origins. It requires minimal water once established, tolerating prolonged dry periods, and has very low fertilizer needs. Avoid overwatering and rich soils to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; native to lean, rocky, nutrient-poor soils, it thrives without supplemental fertilization and can be harmed by rich fertilizers.
