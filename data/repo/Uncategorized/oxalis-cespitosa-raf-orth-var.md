| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Open Woodlands and Grasslands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, consistent with its presence in open fields and forest edges. |

## 🌱 Overview
Oxalis ( (British English) or  (American English)) is a large genus of flowering plants in the wood-sorrel family, Oxalidaceae, comprising over 550 species. The genus occurs throughout most of the world, except for the polar areas; species diversity is particularly rich in tropical Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.
Many of the species are known as wood-sorrels (also as wood sorrels or woodsorrels) as they have an acidic taste reminiscent of the sorrel proper (Rumex acetosa), which is not closely related. Some species are called yellow sorrels or pink sorrels after the colour of their flowers instead. Other species are colloquially known as false shamrocks, and some called sourgrasses. For the genus as a whole, the term oxalises is also used.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable plant thrives in conditions mimicking its temperate native habitat, preferring full sun to partial shade. Provide consistent moisture, ensuring the soil dries slightly between waterings, and offer light fertilization during the growing season to support healthy growth without over-enrichment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season, or a slow-release granular fertilizer in spring, as its native soils are not typically exceptionally rich.
