## 🧤 Care Instructions
This variety of Prickly Currant thrives in cool, moist, and partially shaded environments typical of its native Western North American montane forests. Provide consistently moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter, and protect it from intense afternoon sun. Minimal fertilization is needed, focusing on organic amendments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
