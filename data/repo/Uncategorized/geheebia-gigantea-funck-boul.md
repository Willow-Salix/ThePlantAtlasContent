# Giant Geheebia Moss
### *Geheebia gigantea (Funck) Boul.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions of Europe (e.g., Alps, Pyrenees) and eastern North America (e.g., Appalachian Mountains). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically moist, shaded ravines and rocky outcrops with high humidity, often near streams or waterfalls). |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to very low light, preferring deep shade. Direct sun should be avoided as it can cause desiccation and inhibit growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture and high humidity. The substrate should be kept constantly damp but not waterlogged, often benefiting from daily misting or placement in a terrarium. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in environments mimicking its native, cool, moist, and deeply shaded forest ravines. Ensure consistently damp substrate and high ambient humidity with very low light exposure. Minimal fertilization is required, as over-fertilization can harm the delicate plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. If used, apply a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly, perhaps once or twice a year, as excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
