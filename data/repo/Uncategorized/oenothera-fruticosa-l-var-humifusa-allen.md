| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (specifically coastal plains from North Carolina to Florida) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Coastal Plain |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to Moderate; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it's adapted to well-drained, sandy soils and can tolerate some drought. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Oenothera fruticosa var. humifusa thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, characteristic of its native coastal plain environment. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and provide minimal fertilization to mimic its natural, lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; its native sandy soils are typically lean, so it thrives without heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer once in spring is sufficient.
