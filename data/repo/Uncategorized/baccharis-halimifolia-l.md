## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (from coastal Delaware south to Florida and west to Texas and Oklahoma), Mexico, and the West Indies. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Coastal |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth and flowering, but can tolerate partial shade. Its native habitat in open coastal areas indicates a high tolerance for direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Tolerates drought once established due to its adaptability to varying soil moisture. However, it thrives with regular moisture, reflecting the typical rainfall in its humid subtropical native range. Water deeply when the topsoil dries out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Baccharis halimifolia is a North American species of shrubs in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Nova Scotia, the eastern and southern United States (from Massachusetts south to Florida and west to Texas and Oklahoma), eastern Mexico (Nuevo León, San Luis Potosí, Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Quintana Roo), the Bahamas, and Cuba.
Widely used common names include eastern baccharis, groundsel bush, sea myrtle, and saltbush. Consumption weed, cotton-seed tree, groundsel tree, menguilié, and silverling are also used more locally.  In most of its range, where no other species of the genus occur, this plant is often simply called baccharis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Eastern Baccharis is a resilient plant best suited for full sun in a humid subtropical coastal environment. It requires regular watering for optimal health but is notably drought-tolerant once mature. Due to its adaptability to varied and often poor soils, it has low fertilization needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As it often grows in disturbed sites and coastal areas with less fertile soils, it does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if growth is poor.
