## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, humid, and shaded environments, replicating its native old-growth conifer forest habitat. It requires consistent moisture and high atmospheric humidity, with minimal to no external fertilization due to its sensitivity.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. Lichens are sensitive to pollutants and excessive nutrients, typically absorbing what they need from air and rain.
