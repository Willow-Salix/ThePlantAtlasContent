## 🧤 Care Instructions
To successfully cultivate Creamy Ragwort, replicate its native subalpine conditions by providing full to partial sun and ensuring excellent soil drainage. Maintain consistent moisture during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, as this plant is adapted to less nutrient-rich environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring is generally sufficient. It can thrive in lean, rocky soils characteristic of its native habitat without heavy feeding.
