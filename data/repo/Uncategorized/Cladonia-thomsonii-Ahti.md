## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America (Pacific Northwest, Alaska), parts of Europe (e.g., Scandinavia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate to Boreal Forest, characterized by cool temperatures, moderate to high precipitation, and often high humidity. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Prefers filtered light and protection from intense, direct sun, especially in warmer climates. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity is crucial. Requires frequent misting or light watering with distilled/rainwater to keep the environment consistently moist, but avoid prolonged standing water. Allow for slight drying of the substrate surface between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations.
Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).
Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.
Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dunes, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.
Larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes continuella, feed on Cladonia species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thomson's Cup Lichen thrives in cool, consistently humid environments with bright, indirect or filtered light. Provide frequent misting or light watering with pure water, ensuring good air circulation to prevent rot. Fertilization is unnecessary and can be harmful to this slow-growing, nutrient-averse organism.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is needed or recommended. Lichens thrive in nutrient-poor environments and can be harmed by typical plant fertilizers.
