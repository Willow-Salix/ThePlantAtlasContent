| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western Idaho, USA (specifically, mountainous regions such as the Payette National Forest) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-Arid Montane Shrubland/Grassland (characterized by cold winters, dry summers, and open, rocky slopes) |

## 🌱 Overview
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.
