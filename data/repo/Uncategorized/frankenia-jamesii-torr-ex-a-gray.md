| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers high light exposure typical of open desert and scrubland environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings, mimicking its native low-rainfall environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Frankenia (sea heath) is the only genus in the Frankeniaceae family of flowering plants. Other genera have been recognized within the family, such as Anthobryum, Hypericopsis and Niederleinia, but molecular phylogenetic studies have consistently shown that they all belong inside Frankenia. Frankenia comprises about 70–80 species of shrubs, subshrubs and herbaceous plants, adapted to saline and dry environments throughout temperate and subtropical regions. A few species are in cultivation as ornamental plants.

James' Seaheath thrives in conditions similar to its arid native habitat. Provide full sun exposure and allow the soil to dry out completely between infrequent waterings. This plant is highly drought-tolerant and needs very little supplemental fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires minimal to no fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor or saline desert soils.
