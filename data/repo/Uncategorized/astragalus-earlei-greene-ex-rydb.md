## 🧤 Care Instructions
Earle's Milkvetch thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering with excellent drainage. As a legume, it has low nitrogen needs; a light annual fertilization is ample, if any, to support its growth in lean, well-draining soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none at all if soil is naturally lean, due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.
