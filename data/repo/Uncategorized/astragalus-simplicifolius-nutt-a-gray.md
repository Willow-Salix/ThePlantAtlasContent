## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils, reflecting its native arid scrubland habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid heavy fertilization, especially nitrogen-rich types, due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and adaptation to lean soils. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. A very light application of a low-nitrogen, balanced fertilizer once in spring might be beneficial in extremely poor soils, but is generally not needed.
