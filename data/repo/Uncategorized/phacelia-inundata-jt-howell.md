## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (California, Nevada, Oregon) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-arid Desert (specifically ephemeral wetlands/playas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun; requires direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day, typical of open playa environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Heavy watering during active growth, mimicking seasonal inundation followed by dry periods. Drought-tolerant once established, but thrives with periodic heavy moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Phacelia (phacelia, scorpionweed, heliotrope) is a genus of about 200 species of annual or perennial herbaceous plants in the borage family, native to North and South America. California is particularly rich in species with over 90 recorded in the region.
The genus is traditionally placed at family rank with the waterleafs (Hydrophyllaceae) in the order Boraginales. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, recognizing that the traditional Boraginaceae and Hydrophyllaceae are paraphyletic with respect to each other, merges the latter into the former and considers the family basal in the Euasterids I clade. Other botanists continue to recognize the Hydrophyllaceae and Boraginales after analysing the secondary structure of the ITS1 genetic region rather than its sequence for these higher taxonomic levels.  This placed Phacelia within the Hydrophyllaceae. Further molecular taxonomic analysis of the Boraginales has divided the Boraginales in two and placed Phacelia among the monophyletic herbaceous Hydrophyllaceae in Boraginales II.
The genus includes both annual and perennial species. Many have been cultivated as garden and honey plants.
There are reports that glandular hairs of stems, flowers and leaves of some species of Phacelia secrete oil droplets that can cause an unpleasant skin rash (contact dermatitis) in some people, specifically from P. brachyloba, P. campanularia, P. crenulata, P. gina-glenneae, P. grandiflora, P. ixodes, P. minor, and P. pedicellata. The major contact allergen of P. crenulata has been identified as geranylhydroquinone and of P. minor as geranylgeranylhydroquinone.
The mining bee Andrena phaceliae is a specialist pollinator of this genus in the Eastern United States.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Playa Yellow Phacelia thrives in full sun and requires a watering regimen that simulates its native playa environment, with periods of heavy moisture followed by dry spells. It is adapted to lean soils, so minimal fertilization is necessary, primarily during its active growing phase.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean, well-draining soils. A light application of balanced fertilizer once per season during active growth is sufficient, as it's adapted to often mineral-rich, nutrient-poor playa soils.
