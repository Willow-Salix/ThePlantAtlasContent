## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia (South America) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Grassland/Savanna |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight) for best growth and vigor, tolerates light partial shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering is needed for establishment; highly drought-tolerant once mature due to its extensive rhizome system, but thrives with consistent moisture during active growth. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arachis is a genus of about 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family (Fabaceae), native to South America, and was recently assigned to the informal monophyletic Pterocarpus clade of the Dalbergieae. At least one species, the peanut (Arachis hypogaea), is a major food crop species of global importance; some of the other species are cultivated for food to a small extent in South America. Other species such as A. pintoi are cultivated worldwide as forage and soil conditioner plants, with the leaves providing high-protein feed for grazing livestock and a nitrogen source in agroforestry and permaculture systems.
Arachis species, including the peanut, are used as food plants by some Lepidoptera species, including the flame shoulder, nutmeg, and turnip moth.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rhizoma Peanut is a low-maintenance perennial that thrives in full sun, reminiscent of its native grassland environment. It requires moderate watering during establishment but exhibits remarkable drought tolerance once its extensive root system is developed. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it typically does not require nitrogen fertilizer. Benefits from phosphorus and potassium, especially in soils with low nutrient availability.
