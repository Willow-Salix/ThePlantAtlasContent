## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Arizona) and Baja California, Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Desert Oasis |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate to regular watering, especially when young or during hot, dry periods, as it naturally occurs near water sources in its native habitat. Drought-tolerant once established but performs best with consistent moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Washingtonia filifera, commonly known as the California fan palm, or desert fan palm, is a flowering plant in the family Arecaceae, native to the far southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It typically grows 15–20 m (49–66 ft) tall and 3–6 m (10–20 ft) wide, with a sturdy, columnar trunk and waxy, fan-shaped (palmate) leaves. As a monocot, it is evergreen and exhibits a tree-like growth habit.
It is the only palm species native to the southwestern United States, forming groves around perennial water sources in the Colorado, Mojave, and Sonoran deserts. These stands provide critical habitat for wildlife and were historically used by Indigenous peoples of the region for food, shelter, and materials. Today the California fan palm is widely planted as an ornamental tree in arid and subtropical climates, though wild populations face pressures from groundwater decline, and habitat alteration.
In California, where the majority of its native groves occur, the species forms iconic desert oases such as the Oasis of Mara in Joshua Tree National Park, the Thousand Palms Oasis in the Coachella Valley Preserve, Lost Palms Oasis, and Fortynine Palms Oasis. Outside California, notable populations are protected at Castle Creek in Arizona's Bradshaw Mountains, the Hassayampa River Preserve, and Kofa National Wildlife Refuge.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The California Fan Palm thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its desert oasis origins. While drought-tolerant once established, it prefers regular watering and benefits from a palm-specific fertilizer during active growth. Ensure adequate space for its large size and root system.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate, benefiting from a slow-release palm-specific fertilizer during the growing season to supplement desert-like soil conditions.
