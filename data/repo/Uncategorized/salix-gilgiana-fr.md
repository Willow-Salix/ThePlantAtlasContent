## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This willow thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist to wet soil, never allowing it to dry out. It benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growth period, mirroring the rich, organic soils of its native Japanese riparian habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high; benefits from a balanced fertilizer during the growing season, especially in poorer soils, as its native riparian soils are often rich in organic matter.
