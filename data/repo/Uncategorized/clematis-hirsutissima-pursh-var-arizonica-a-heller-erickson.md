## 🌱 Overview
Clematis is a genus of about 380 species within the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae. Their garden hybrids and cultivars have been popular among gardeners, beginning with Clematis 'Jackmanii', a garden staple since 1862.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Arizona Clematis thrives in conditions mimicking its native high-elevation semi-arid habitat, requiring full to partial sun and well-draining soil. It prefers moderate, infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization in spring to support its growth and flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer sparingly in early spring, or only if soil is demonstrably poor.
