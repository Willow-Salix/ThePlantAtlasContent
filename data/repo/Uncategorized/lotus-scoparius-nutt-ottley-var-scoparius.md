## 🧤 Care Instructions
Common deerweed is a highly adaptable, low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and dry conditions. It is extremely drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and performs best in poor, well-draining soils without the need for regular fertilization. This makes it ideal for xeriscaping or arid garden environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. This plant thrives in lean soils and, as a legume, can fix its own nitrogen.
