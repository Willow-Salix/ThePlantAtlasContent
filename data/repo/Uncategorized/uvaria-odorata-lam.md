## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Ylang-ylang Vine, provide bright, indirect light and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, simulating its tropical rainforest origin. High humidity is crucial, and regular fertilization during the growing season will promote healthy growth and abundant blooms.
