## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including British Columbia (Canada) and the Northwestern United States (e.g., Oregon, Washington, Northern California, Idaho, Montana). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Moist Shrubland/Woodland, often found in riparian zones, wet meadows, and open, moist forests. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for optimal flowering and densest growth, but tolerates some afternoon shade, especially in warmer regions. |
| **💧 Water** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native habitat along streambanks and wet areas. Do not allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Spiraea , sometimes spelled spirea in common names, and commonly known as meadowsweets or steeplebushes, is a genus of about 80 to 100 species of shrubs in the family Rosaceae. They are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest diversity in eastern Asia.
The genus formerly included the herbaceous species now segregated into the genera Filipendula and Aruncus; recent genetic evidence has shown that Filipendula is only distantly related to Spiraea, belonging in the subfamily Rosoideae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rose Spirea thrives in consistently moist to wet soil conditions, ideally receiving full sun to partial shade to encourage robust flowering. Regular watering is essential to maintain damp soil, reflecting its native riparian habitats. It benefits from a light annual fertilization in early spring to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in moderately fertile soils. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or less if soil is naturally rich.
