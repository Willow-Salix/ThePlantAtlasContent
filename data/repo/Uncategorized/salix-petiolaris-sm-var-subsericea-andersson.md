## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern North America (Canada and northern United States) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Wetland / Boreal Wetland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Sun (requires significant light exposure typical of open wet areas) |
| **💧 Water** | High (requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, mimicking its native boggy or riparian habitats) |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This willow thrives in full to partial sun, needing consistently moist to wet soil to replicate its native wetland environments. It benefits from rich, organic soil but generally requires only low to moderate fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate (thrives in naturally rich organic soils of wetlands but is not a heavy feeder requiring frequent fertilization in cultivation)
