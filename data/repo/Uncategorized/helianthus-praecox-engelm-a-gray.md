## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Texas, USA (coastal plains and sandy areas) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Warm Temperate Grassland/Prairie |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open prairie habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Allow the top 2-3 inches of soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, but benefits from consistent moisture during active growth and flowering, with excellent drainage being crucial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Helianthus () is a genus comprising around 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the daisy family Asteraceae commonly known as sunflowers. Except for three South American species, the species of Helianthus are native to North America and Central America. The best-known species is the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus). This and other species, notably Jerusalem artichoke (H. tuberosus), are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions, as food crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants. The species H. annuus typically grows during the summer and into early fall, with the peak growth season being mid-summer.
Several perennial Helianthus species are grown in gardens, but have a tendency to spread rapidly and can become aggressive.  On the other hand, the whorled sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus, was listed as an endangered species in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule protecting it under the Endangered Species Act. The primary threats to this species are industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. They grow to 1.8 metres (6 feet) and are primarily found in woodlands, adjacent to creeks and moist, prairie-like areas.
The common sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine, cultivated there for several centuries.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Texas sunflower flourishes in full sun and well-drained, sandy or average soils, mirroring its native prairie environment. It requires moderate watering, allowing for periods of dryness, and generally has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to average to sandy soils, a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly once at the beginning of the growing season, especially in nutrient-poor soils.
