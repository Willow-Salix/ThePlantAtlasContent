## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Pacific Northwest of the United States (Oregon, Washington, Idaho, northern California) and southwestern Canada (British Columbia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland and open woodlands, characterized by wet winters/springs and dry, hot summers. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Native habitats are open prairies and rocky slopes, indicating a preference for abundant direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is required during its active growing and flowering period in late winter and spring. It is drought-tolerant and prefers dry conditions during its summer dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Olsynium is a genus of summer-dormant rhizomatous perennial flowering plants in the iris family Iridaceae, native to sunny hillsides in South America and western North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, provide full sun exposure and well-drained soil that mimics its native temperate grassland environment. Water consistently during its active growth in late winter and spring, then allow the soil to dry out completely as the plant enters summer dormancy. Fertilizer needs are minimal, as it prefers leaner conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. These plants are adapted to leaner soils found in their native grasslands. Over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen, can promote foliage at the expense of flowers.
