| **🌍 Origin** | Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate Forest Understory |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to full shade. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch fronds. It thrives in dappled light conditions similar to a forest floor. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is key. Water regularly to keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged, allowing the top inch to dry slightly between waterings. High humidity is also beneficial. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Korean Tasselfern thrives in conditions that mimic its native East Asian forest floor, requiring consistent moisture, high humidity, and protection from direct sunlight. Provide dappled to full shade and keep the soil evenly moist, offering moderate fertilization during active growth to support its lush foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a diluted liquid fertilizer (half strength) every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
