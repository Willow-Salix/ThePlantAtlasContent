## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah) and Baja California, Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Rocky Deserts. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring high light conditions typical of rocky desert slopes where it often grows in crevices. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; allow soil to dry out completely between infrequent, deep waterings. Requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native habitat where rainfall is scarce but intense. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cheilanthes, commonly known as lip ferns, is a genus of about 180 species of rock-dwelling ferns with a cosmopolitan distribution in warm, dry, rocky regions, often growing in small crevices high up on cliffs.  Most are small, sturdy and evergreen.   The leaves, often densely covered in trichomes, spring directly from the rootstocks.  Many of them are desert ferns, curling up during dry times and reviving with the coming of moisture.  At the ends of veins sporangia, or spore-bearing structures, are protected by leaf margins, which curl over them.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Coville's Lipfern is a xeric fern requiring conditions similar to its native arid environment. Provide full sun to partial shade, very infrequent watering with excellent drainage, and avoid over-fertilizing. It thrives on neglect in well-drained, rocky substrates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization needed, as it naturally thrives in poor, rocky soils. Over-fertilizing can harm the plant.
