## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and subarctic North America, including Alaska, Yukon, Northwest Territories, Greenland, and parts of arctic Canada |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic Tundra / Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in open, exposed alpine and arctic environments above the tree line with intense light. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture during the short growing season, provided by snowmelt, but requires excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging; tolerant of drier conditions during dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Saxifraga oppositifolia, the purple saxifrage or purple mountain saxifrage, is a species of plant that is very common in the high Arctic and also some high mountainous areas further south, including northern Britain, the Alps and the Rocky Mountains.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arctic-alpine plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained, gritty soil that remains consistently moist during its short growing season. Minimal fertilization is required due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. Provide a cool environment and excellent drainage to mimic its native tundra habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; its native soils are poor and rocky, so it is adapted to nutrient-scarce conditions. If fertilized, use a very dilute, balanced feed once early in the growing season.
