# Sphaerostephanos Invisus
### *Sphaerostephanos invisus (G. Forst.) Holttum*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Caroline Islands, Fiji, Marianas, New Caledonia, Niue, Samoa, Society Islands, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu, Wallis & Futuna Islands |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light; prefers shaded conditions similar to a forest understory. Avoid direct sunlight which can scorch fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged, mimicking continuous rainfall in its native habitat. Never allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. High ambient humidity is crucial. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sphaerostephanos invisus thrives in the warm, humid conditions of its native Pacific Island rainforests. Provide low to medium indirect light and ensure the soil remains consistently moist, never drying out. Fertilize sparingly during the growing season for best results.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Rainforest soils, while rich in organic matter, can have nutrients quickly leached.
