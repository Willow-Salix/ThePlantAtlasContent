## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America (Appalachian Mountains, including parts of the USA and Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest (specifically humid, shaded microclimates within this biome) |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light. Thrives in deeply shaded conditions, mimicking its natural habitat on the forest floor or under dense canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is crucial; the substrate should remain damp but not waterlogged. High ambient humidity is also essential, often requiring misting or a humid environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arbuscula (Latin: Arbuscŭla; d. between 54 and 35 BCE) was a woman stage performer of ancient Rome. She was a celebrated actor in pantomimes during the 1st century BCE, when most of the female parts at the time were played by men at least in tragedy. 
Cicero speaks of her in 54 BC as having been very successful, and having given him great pleasure. Horace mentions her as having been hissed and booed at by an audience, though it is said she did not care that the common people booed her, and remarked, "It is enough the knights still applaud me."

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss requires a consistently moist, humid environment with very low, indirect light, mimicking the shaded, damp conditions of the Appalachian forest floor. Avoid direct sun and ensure good airflow to prevent rot, while maintaining high humidity levels. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses typically have minimal nutrient needs and can be harmed by excessive fertilization.
