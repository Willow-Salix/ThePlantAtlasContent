## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical regions, including parts of Central & South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest (Humid) |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect to low light; prefers dappled shade conditions similar to a forest understory. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity is paramount. Requires consistent moisture, often achieved through frequent misting or a high-humidity environment (e.g., terrarium). Avoid prolonged saturation of the substrate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Thelidium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Verrucariaceae. The genus was established in 1855 by the Italian lichenologist Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo, who distinguished it from related genera by its point-like fruiting bodies with distinctive double walls and granular spores. These lichens form thin crusts on rock surfaces and reproduce through tiny, black, flask-shaped structures that contain spores. The genus includes about 27 species found worldwide, ranging from common European species to more recently discovered ones from Asia and Australia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Melanotheca cruenta thrives in consistently high humidity and indirect to low light, mirroring its tropical rainforest origin. It needs regular moisture from misting and excellent air circulation to prevent issues, with no need for external fertilizers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. Lichens absorb nutrients primarily from the air and rainwater, and are sensitive to chemical fertilizers.
