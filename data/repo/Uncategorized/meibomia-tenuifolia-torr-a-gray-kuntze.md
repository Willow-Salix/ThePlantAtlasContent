## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions characteristic of its native pine barren habitat. Provide moderate water, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and use fertilizer sparingly to mimic its natural environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; a light, balanced fertilizer applied once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor pineland soils.
