## 🧤 Care Instructions
This East African native thrives in bright, sunny conditions, characteristic of tropical savannas. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and provide light fertilization during active growth. Its adaptation to dry seasons makes it relatively drought-tolerant and low-maintenance once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, diluted fertilizer during the growing season. As a legume, it has lower nitrogen requirements due to nitrogen fixation.
