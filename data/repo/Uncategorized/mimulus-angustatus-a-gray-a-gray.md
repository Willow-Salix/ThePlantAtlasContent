## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically California, primarily in the Sierra Nevada foothills and Central Valley. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, specialized in vernal pools or seasonally wet depressions. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, unsheltered vernal pool environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist to wet conditions during its active growing season (late winter through spring) to mimic its vernal pool habitat, followed by a dry dormancy period in summer. |

## 🌱 Overview
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This vernal pool specialist thrives in full sun and demands consistently wet conditions during its active growth in late winter and spring. It requires a distinct dry dormancy period through the summer months to mimic its native Mediterranean climate and vernal pool cycle.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Vernal pool soils are not typically rich; a light, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season if soil is poor, but often not necessary.
