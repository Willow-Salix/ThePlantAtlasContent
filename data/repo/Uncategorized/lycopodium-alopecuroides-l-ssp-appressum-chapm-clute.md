## 🌱 Overview
Lycopodium (from Ancient Greek lykos, wolf and podion, diminutive of pous, foot) is a genus of clubmosses, also known as ground pines or creeping cedars, in the family Lycopodiaceae. Two very different circumscriptions of the genus are in use. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Lycopodium is one of nine genera in the subfamily Lycopodioideae, and has from nine to 15 species. In other classifications, the genus is equivalent to the whole of the subfamily, since it includes all of the other genera. More than 40 species are accepted.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This clubmoss thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, mimicking its native boggy habitats and should never dry out. It prefers full sun to partial shade and benefits from high humidity. Minimal fertilization is needed for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is required. If fertilized, use a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly during the active growing season.
