## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant, native to Central Asian steppes and meadows, prefers bright, open environments with full to partial sun exposure. It requires well-drained soil and a watering regimen that allows the soil to dry completely between applications, tolerating periods of drought. Fertilization should be minimal, focused on supporting active growth rather than heavy feeding.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Apply a balanced, dilute liquid fertilizer sparingly once or twice during the active growing season, or use a slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring.
