## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss requires conditions similar to its native forest understory, meaning very low, indirect light and consistently high humidity. Its substrate must be kept uniformly moist, as it is highly sensitive to drying out. Fertilization is rarely needed and should be minimal.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer; if applied, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid solution (e.g., for epiphytes) once or twice a year at most.
