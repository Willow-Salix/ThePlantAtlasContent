## 🌱 Overview
Mycobilimbia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. These lichens are characterized by their crust-like growth form that appears as a thin layer on various surfaces, ranging in colour from creamy white to greenish-grey. The genus was proposed by the German lichenologist Heinrich Rehm in 1890. Mycobilimbia species can be identified by their distinctive reproductive structures (apothecia) that start as flat discs and later become convex bumps, typically in beige to reddish-brown colours.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mycobilimbia lichens thrive in cool, humid conditions with low to indirect light, mimicking their native temperate forest habitats. They do not require traditional fertilization and are sensitive to concentrated mineral salts, relying instead on ambient nutrients and consistent moisture.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; lichens obtain nutrients from air and rain and are sensitive to mineral salts.
