## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Long Beech Fern thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shady conditions, mirroring its temperate forest origins. Provide ample humidity and protect it from direct sunlight to ensure lush frond growth and overall health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient, as it naturally grows in soils rich in decaying organic matter but not overly fertile. A diluted balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season is adequate.
