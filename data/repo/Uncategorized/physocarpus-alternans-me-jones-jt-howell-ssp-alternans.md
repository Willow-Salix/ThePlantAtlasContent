## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (Intermountain West region) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Montane Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. More frequent watering may be needed in extreme heat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Physocarpus, commonly called ninebark, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae, native to North America (most species) and northeastern Asia (one species). 
The genus name Physocarpus comes from the Greek for "bladder fruit", referring to the inflated fruits of some species. The common name 'ninebark' refers to the peeling bark of mature branches, which comes away in strips.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dwarf Ninebark thrives in conditions mimicking its arid montane scrubland origin, preferring full sun and well-draining soil. It is very drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent deep watering. Minimal fertilization is typically needed, making it a low-maintenance shrub.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient if growth is weak or soil is very poor.
