## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (including Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California) and Northern Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-Arid Grasslands and Desert Riparian Zones |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6-8+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; water deeply and infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It naturally occurs near water sources, so it can tolerate periodic flooding. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sporobolus is a nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. The name Sporobolus means "seed-thrower", and is derived from Ancient Greek word σπόρος (spóros), meaning "seed", and the root of βάλλειν (bállein) "to throw", referring to the dispersion of seeds. Members of the genus are usually called dropseeds or sacaton grasses. They are typical prairie and savanna plants, occurring in other types of open habitat in warmer climates. At least one species (S. caespitosus from Saint Helena) is threatened with extinction, and another (S. durus from Ascension Island) is extinct.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Big Sacaton is a resilient, warm-season grass that thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established, despite its natural presence near water. Provide well-draining soil, deep but infrequent watering, and minimal fertilization for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; this grass is adapted to poor to moderately fertile soils. A light application of a balanced fertilizer in early spring can encourage growth but is generally not essential.
