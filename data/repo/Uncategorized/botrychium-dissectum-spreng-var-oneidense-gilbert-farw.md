## 🌱 Overview
Botrychium is a genus of ferns, seedless vascular plants in the family Ophioglossaceae. Botrychium species are known as moonworts. They are small, with fleshy roots, and reproduce by spores shed into the air. One part of the leaf, the trophophore, is sterile and fernlike; the other, the sporophore, is fertile and carries the clusters of sporangia or spore cases.  Some species only occasionally emerge above ground and gain most of their nourishment from an association with mycorrhizal fungi.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Oneida Grapefern requires a cool, shaded environment with consistently moist, well-draining, and organically rich soil, mimicking its native temperate forest understory. Protect it from direct sun and ensure high humidity for optimal growth and health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in rich, organic soil from decomposed leaf litter. A light application of compost or a balanced organic fertilizer in spring is sufficient.
