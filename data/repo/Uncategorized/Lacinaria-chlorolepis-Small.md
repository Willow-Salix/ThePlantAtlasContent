## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Scaly Blazingstar flourishes in full sun and well-drained, sandy soil, reflecting its native pine flatwood and savanna habitats. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and is quite drought-tolerant once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it prefers leaner soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient. It naturally thrives in average to somewhat poor, sandy soils.
