## 🧤 Care Instructions
Western Golden Corydalis prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between applications, as it adapts to seasonal dry spells. Light fertilization can support its growth as an annual or biennial, especially in poorer soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization or average soil fertility; does not require rich soil and can be sensitive to over-fertilization.
