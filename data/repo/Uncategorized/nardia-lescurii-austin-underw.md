## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America, including Newfoundland, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Arkansas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically, moist, shaded areas within temperate forests). |
| **☀️ Light** | Low light to partial shade. Mimic the dappled light of a forest floor; direct sunlight will scorch it. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist substrate; never allow it to dry out. High ambient humidity is crucial, potentially requiring misting or a terrarium environment. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Nardia lescurii thrives in cool, consistently moist, and humid environments with low, indirect light, replicating its native temperate forest floor habitat. It requires a substrate that is constantly damp but not waterlogged, benefiting significantly from high ambient humidity, and has very minimal or no fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Liverworts obtain most nutrients from their environment; excessive fertilization can be harmful. If needed, use an extremely diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly.
