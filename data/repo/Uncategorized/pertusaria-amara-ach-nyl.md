## 🌱 Overview
Pertusaria is a large genus of warty crustose lichens in the Pertusariaceae family. The fruiting bodies are usually modified apothecia that immersed in warts on the main body (thallus) with small holes for the spores to emerge, similar to ostioles, or are fully above and lecanorine (spore bearing discs surrounded by a ring of tissue similar to the tissue of the thallus.  Members of the genus are commonly called wart lichens.
The widespread genus contains over 500 species.
Classification in the large genus relies heavily on thallus chemistry to distinguish and classify species, some of which differ only in the presence or absence of a single secondary chemical. Lichexanthone, norlichexanthone, and their chlorinated derivatives are common in this genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pertusaria amara, a lichen, thrives in humid, temperate forest conditions with low to moderate indirect light. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere, making high humidity and clean air essential for its survival, while traditional fertilizers are unnecessary and potentially detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers; relies on atmospheric nutrients and clean air quality, absorbing what it needs directly from its environment.
