## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wright's Cudweed thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid to semi-arid montane environment, requiring full sun to partial sun and infrequent watering. It is highly drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining, poor to average soils, with minimal need for fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; naturally grows in poor to average, well-draining soils. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as rich soil can be detrimental.
