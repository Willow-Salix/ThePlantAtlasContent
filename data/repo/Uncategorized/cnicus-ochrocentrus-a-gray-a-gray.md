## 🧤 Care Instructions
This thistle thrives on neglect, requiring full sun exposure and very little water once established. It prefers well-draining soil and will perform best without supplemental fertilization, mirroring its adaptation to arid, nutrient-poor montane environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. This plant is adapted to poor, rocky, or sandy soils typical of its native habitat and excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
