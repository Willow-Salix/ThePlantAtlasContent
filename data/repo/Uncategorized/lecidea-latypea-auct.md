## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of Europe and North America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Filtered light to partial shade, avoiding harsh, direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent atmospheric moisture from regular rainfall and high humidity; no substrate watering is required as lichens absorb water directly from the air. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This crustose lichen thrives in conditions mirroring its native temperate forest habitat, requiring consistent atmospheric moisture from rain and high humidity, alongside filtered light. It obtains all necessary nutrients from the air and its substrate, making traditional watering and fertilizing not only unnecessary but potentially harmful.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None; lichens obtain necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust) and their substrate, and are sensitive to chemical fertilizers.
