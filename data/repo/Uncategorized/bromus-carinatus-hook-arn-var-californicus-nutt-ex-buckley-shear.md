## 🧤 Care Instructions
California Brome is a robust native grass thriving in full sun to partial shade, mirroring its origins in temperate grasslands. It requires moderate water during its active cooler growing season but is highly drought-tolerant once established, preferring dry conditions in summer. Minimal to no fertilization is necessary, as it is adapted to lean native soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. This native grass is adapted to lean soils and over-fertilization can be detrimental, promoting excessive foliage at the expense of vigor.
