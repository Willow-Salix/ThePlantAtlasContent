# Amblystegiella Alpicola
### *Amblystegiella alpicola (Lindb. ex Lindb. & Arnell) Broth.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions; alpine and subalpine zones across the Northern Hemisphere, including Scandinavia, Greenland, North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, mountainous western United States), and northern Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Boreal Forest (wet, cool-temperate to cold) |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate indirect light; prefers cool, shaded conditions, avoiding direct harsh sun that can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist; the substrate should never be allowed to dry out. Requires high humidity and can benefit from frequent misting or placement in a terrarium. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Amblystegiella alpicola is an arctic-alpine moss that demands a consistently cool, very humid environment with perpetually moist substrate. It thrives in low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its natural habitat on wet rocks and stream banks, and requires virtually no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses have very low nutrient requirements; if any is applied, use an extremely diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 strength or less) very sparingly.
