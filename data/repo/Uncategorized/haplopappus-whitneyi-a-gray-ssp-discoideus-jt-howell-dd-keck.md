## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Sierra Nevada, California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine zones |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring direct, unfiltered light for most of the day, reflecting its high-elevation, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It's adapted to well-drained, rocky soils and can tolerate periods of drought once established, but appreciates moisture during active growth from snowmelt. |

## 🌱 Overview
Haplopappus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae found in South America, mostly restricted to the dry regions of the Southern Andes, Chilean Matorral, and Patagonia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and requires very well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native rocky slopes. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between applications, and avoid excessive fertilization. It's drought-tolerant once established, preferring natural moisture cycles.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native to lean, rocky, nutrient-poor soils, this plant does best without rich amendments or heavy feeding.
