## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cold, bright, and airy conditions typical of arctic and alpine environments. Provide high light exposure and ensure periods of thorough wetting followed by complete drying to mimic natural precipitation patterns. Avoid all forms of traditional fertilization, as it draws nutrients from the air and substrate naturally.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; traditional fertilizers are detrimental. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and substrate.
