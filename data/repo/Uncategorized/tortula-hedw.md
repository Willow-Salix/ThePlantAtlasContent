| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Cosmopolitan, widespread across temperate, semi-arid, and even some arid regions globally, including North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. Often found in urban areas, disturbed sites, and on rocks or soil. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Semi-Arid, often pioneer in exposed environments, capable of tolerating periods of desiccation. |
| **☀️ Light** | Thrives in bright, indirect light to full sun. Tolerant of direct sunlight, especially if provided with adequate moisture during growth periods, but can also adapt to partial shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular moisture to grow actively, but is highly tolerant of periods of drought and desiccation. Allow the substrate to dry out significantly between waterings, then rehydrate thoroughly. Avoid constantly soggy conditions. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tortula moss is a hardy and adaptable plant, thriving in bright light and able to withstand significant drying out. It prefers a cycle of drying and thorough rehydration, requiring minimal to no fertilization. This resilient moss is suitable for various exposed and semi-dry environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Fertilization is generally not necessary, and excessive nutrients can be harmful. If desired, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly, perhaps once a year.
