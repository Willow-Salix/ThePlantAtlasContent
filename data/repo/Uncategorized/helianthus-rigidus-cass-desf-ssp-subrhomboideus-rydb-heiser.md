## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central North America, primarily the Great Plains region of the United States and Canada |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland (Prairie) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open prairie habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, consistent moisture for establishment; highly drought-tolerant once mature, requiring less frequent watering mimicking natural prairie dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Helianthus () is a genus comprising around 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the daisy family Asteraceae commonly known as sunflowers. Except for three South American species, the species of Helianthus are native to North America and Central America. The best-known species is the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus). This and other species, notably Jerusalem artichoke (H. tuberosus), are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions, as food crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants. The species H. annuus typically grows during the summer and into early fall, with the peak growth season being mid-summer.
Several perennial Helianthus species are grown in gardens, but have a tendency to spread rapidly and can become aggressive.  On the other hand, the whorled sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus, was listed as an endangered species in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule protecting it under the Endangered Species Act. The primary threats to this species are industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. They grow to 1.8 metres (6 feet) and are primarily found in woodlands, adjacent to creeks and moist, prairie-like areas.
The common sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine, cultivated there for several centuries.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stiff Sunflower thrives in open, sunny environments, demanding full sun and well-drained soil typical of its native prairie habitat. It requires moderate watering during establishment but exhibits strong drought tolerance once mature. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to the nutrient cycles of natural grasslands.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally thrives in moderately rich prairie soils without heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is optional, especially in poorer soils.
