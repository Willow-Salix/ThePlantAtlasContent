| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean/Semi-Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily). It thrives in open, exposed areas typical of its native chaparral and scrubland habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water regularly during its active growing season in spring, ensuring well-drained soil. Reduce watering significantly or cease entirely during dry summer months, mimicking its native climate's rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lupine thrives in full sun and lean, well-drained soils, consistent with its Mediterranean and semi-arid native climate. It requires moderate watering during its spring growth period but is highly drought-tolerant once established, preferring dry summer conditions. Avoid over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen, due to its natural nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen from the air into the soil. High nitrogen fertilizers can harm more than help; prefer lean, well-draining soils.
