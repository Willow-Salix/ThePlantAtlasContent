## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lepidopilum moss thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest habitat. Provide very high humidity, consistent moisture without waterlogging, and low, indirect light. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its slow growth and epiphytic nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; if desired, apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once or twice a year at 1/4 strength).
