## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, United States |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently during dry periods, especially during the first year. Avoid overwatering, particularly in summer, as this can lead to root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ceanothus is a genus of about 50–60 species of nitrogen-fixing shrubs and small trees in the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae). Common names for members of this genus are buckbrush, California lilac, soap bush, or just ceanothus. "Ceanothus" comes from Ancient Greek: κεάνωθος (keánōthos), which was applied by Theophrastus (371–287 BC) to an Old World plant believed to be Cirsium arvense.
The genus is native to North America with the highest diversity on the western coast. Some species (e.g., C. americanus) are restricted to the eastern United States and southeast Canada, and others (e.g., C. caeruleus) extend as far south as Guatemala. Most are shrubs 0.5–3 metres (1.6–9.8 ft) tall, but C. arboreus and C. thyrsiflorus, both native to California, can be small multi-trunked trees up to 6–7 metres (20–23 ft) tall.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Ceanothus thrives in conditions mimicking its native Californian Mediterranean climate. Provide full sun and well-draining soil, ensuring deep but infrequent watering once established to promote drought tolerance. Avoid over-fertilization, especially with high nitrogen, as it is a nitrogen-fixing plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally requires little to no fertilizer. If necessary, use a low-nitrogen formula sparingly in early spring. High nitrogen can inhibit growth and flowering.
