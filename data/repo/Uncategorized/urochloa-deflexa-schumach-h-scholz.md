## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical Africa (widespread across West, Central, East, South Tropical Africa) and the Arabian Peninsula |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Savanna and Semi-Arid Grasslands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, as it originates from open grasslands and savannas without significant canopy cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Its native climate experiences distinct wet and dry seasons, indicating drought tolerance. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To cultivate, provide abundant direct sunlight, replicating its native open habitat. Water moderately during its active growth phases, ensuring the soil dries out between applications to mimic seasonal rainfall patterns. Supplement with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season to support healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced fertilizer. Native savanna soils typically offer moderate fertility, requiring nutrient replenishment for robust growth.
