## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Pacific Pea thrives in full sun to partial shade, adapting well to the dry summers characteristic of its native chaparral and woodland habitats. Water moderately during its spring growth, then allow it to remain dry through summer due to its strong drought tolerance. Requires very little fertilizer due to its natural nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen, reducing the need for external nitrogen fertilization. It generally thrives in average to poor, well-draining soils.
