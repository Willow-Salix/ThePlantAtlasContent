## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah) and parts of Northern Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | High, direct sun exposure. This plant thrives in full sun for at least 6-8 hours daily, typical of its open desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low watering. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water deeply but infrequently during the active growing season (spring/summer) and greatly reduce or cease watering during dormancy (fall/winter). |

## 🌱 Overview
Opuntia, commonly called the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family Cactaceae, many known for their flavorful fruit and showy flowers. Cacti are native to the Americas, and are well adapted to arid climates; however, they are still vulnerable to alterations in precipitation and temperature driven by climate change. The plant has been introduced to Australia, southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.
Prickly pear alone is also used to refer to the fruit, but may also be used for the plant itself; in addition, other names given to the plant and its specific parts include tuna (fruit), sabra, sabbar, nopal (pads, plural nopales, from the Nahuatl word nōpalli), nostle (fruit) from the Nahuatl word nōchtli, and paddle cactus. The genus is named for the Ancient Greek city of Opus. The fruit and leaves are edible. The most common culinary species is the "Barbary fig" (Opuntia ficus-indica).
In places where they have been introduced outside their native range, some species in the genus Opuntia behave as aggressive invasive species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus demands intense, direct sunlight and requires very minimal watering, mimicking its arid native environment. Ensure extremely well-draining soil to prevent root rot and fertilize sparingly only during its active growth period in spring and summer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilization. Use a diluted, balanced cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer). Native desert soils are often nutrient-poor, so over-fertilization can be detrimental.
