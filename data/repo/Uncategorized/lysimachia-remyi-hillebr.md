## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in conditions mimicking its native wet, exposed cliff faces. Provide bright, indirect light to partial sun and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, along with high humidity.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season, using a balanced liquid fertilizer, as native cliff soils are typically low in nutrients.
