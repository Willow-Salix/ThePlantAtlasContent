| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern Oregon and Northwestern California (USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Vernal Pool Ecosystem |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in open, unshaded vernal pool environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently wet to saturated conditions during its active growing season (winter and spring), followed by a dry period as the pools evaporate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Limnanthes, the type genus of the family Limnanthaceae, consists of annual herbaceous plants commonly known as the meadowfoams. The seven species are all native to coastal and adjoining regions (inland valleys, foothills and mountains) of western North America, where they typically grow in marshy habitats, such as the margins of vernal pools. Some are endemic to California.
General form ranges from decumbent to erect, with leaves either pinnately lobed or compound; the lobes or leaflets may themselves range from entire to deeply lobed. Both 4- and 5-sepaled and petaled members are known.
The white meadowfoam Limnanthes alba is of commercial interest for its oil, while several other species are rare or endangered. Honey produced by bees that pollinate Limnanthes alba has the distinct flavor of toasted marshmallows.
L. douglasii is widely cultivated as a hardy annual, its white and yellow flower colour giving it the common name of poached egg plant.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To cultivate Woolly Meadowfoam, provide full sun exposure and keep the soil consistently wet or even saturated during its winter-spring growing period, mimicking its vernal pool habitat. This annual thrives in low-nutrient conditions and requires a period of dry dormancy in summer after flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to naturally low-nutrient soils typical of vernal pool habitats.
