## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America (Northeastern USA and Southeastern Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers ample sunlight for best growth and fruiting, typical of forest edges and open woodlands. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, consistent watering; thrives in moist, well-drained soil but is tolerant of occasional dry spells once established, reflecting natural rainfall patterns in temperate regions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus coccinea, the scarlet hawthorn, is a species of hawthorn around which there is considerable confusion because the name has been misapplied for a long time. It has been shown to be the same as C. pedicellata, and under the rules of botanical nomenclature, the older name (C. coccinea) should be used.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate plant prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil, tolerating brief dry periods once established. It requires minimal fertilization, thriving best with a light application in spring if necessary. Mimicking its native open woodland environment ensures healthy growth and vibrant fruit production.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; generally not a heavy feeder. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring, especially in poor soils.
