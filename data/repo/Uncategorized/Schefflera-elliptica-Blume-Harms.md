| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Malesia (including Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Sulawesi, Philippines, and New Guinea) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light. Mimicking its understory habitat, it prefers dappled sunlight and protection from harsh, direct midday sun. |

## 🌱 Overview
Schefflera  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae with 13 species native to New Zealand and some Pacific islands.
The genus is named in honor of Johann Peter Ernst von Scheffler, physician and botanist of Gdańsk, and later of Warsaw, who contributed plants to Gottfried Reyger for Reyger's book, Tentamen Florae Gedanensis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Schefflera elliptica thrives in conditions similar to its native tropical rainforest understory, requiring consistently moist soil, high humidity, and indirect light. Protect it from direct sun exposure and provide moderate fertilization during its growth period to ensure optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding during the active growing season (spring through summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks. Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
