## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and sub-Mediterranean regions including Europe, western North America, Macaronesia, South Africa, Australia (Tasmania), and New Zealand. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate and Sub-Mediterranean, often found in open, exposed rocky or mossy habitats, characterized by distinct seasons, moderate rainfall, and periods of dryness. |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure to bright indirect light. As a lichen growing on exposed rocks or soil, it thrives in open environments with ample natural light and can tolerate full sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent to moderate watering. This lichen tolerates periods of drought and prefers to dry out completely between moistening periods, absorbing moisture from rain, dew, or ambient humidity. |

## 🌱 Overview
Toninia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. The genus contains about 70 recognised species that are distributed worldwide, with many found in arctic and alpine environments as well as arid regions. These lichens are characterised by their often reduced or scale-like thalli and distinctive black apothecia (fruiting bodies) that typically become convex with age and contain needle-shaped ascospores. Toninia species primarily grow on soil, rocks, and other mineral substrates, and are distinguished from related genera by their spore-producing structures and chemical reactions to standard lichen identification tests.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Toninia opuntioides thrives in bright, open environments mirroring its temperate and sub-Mediterranean origins. It requires infrequent watering, tolerating dry periods well, and has no need for supplemental fertilization, obtaining all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens acquire necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate (rocks, soil, bark); supplemental fertilization can be harmful.
