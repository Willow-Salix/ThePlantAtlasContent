## 🌱 Overview
Terminalia is a genus of large trees of the flowering plant family Combretaceae, comprising nearly 300 species distributed in tropical regions of the world. The genus name derives from the Latin word terminus, referring to the fact that the leaves appear at the very tips of the shoots.
Axlewood (T. latifolia) is used for its wood and tannins and as a fodder. African birch (T. leiocarpa) is used for its wood and to make yellow dye and medicinal compounds. A yellow dyestuff produced from the leaves of T. leiocarpa has traditionally been used in West Africa to dye leather.
