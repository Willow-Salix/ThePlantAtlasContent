## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Geranium thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring consistently moist, well-drained soil that mimics its native montane meadow habitats. Provide regular watering throughout the growing season and a light spring feeding to support its vigorous growth and abundant flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderately fertile, humus-rich soil. A light application of balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or well-rotted compost in early spring is sufficient.
