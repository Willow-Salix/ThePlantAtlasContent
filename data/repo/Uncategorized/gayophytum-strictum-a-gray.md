## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native dry woodlands and scrublands. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, along with low fertilizer input, making it a low-maintenance option for dry, sunny locations.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Minimal or no fertilization is required, as it is adapted to less nutrient-rich environments.
