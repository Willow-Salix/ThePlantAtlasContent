## 🧤 Care Instructions
This grass thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical savanna origin, preferring full to partial sun and well-draining soil. It requires regular watering during its active growth but can withstand dry spells. Fertilization is generally not critical due to its adaptation to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer is needed, as it is adapted to the often nutrient-poor soils of its native savanna. A light, balanced fertilizer application once or twice during the growing season would suffice if desired, but is not strictly necessary.
