## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian native thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its natural dry to mesic coastal and shrubland habitats. Water moderately, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization. Once established, it exhibits good drought tolerance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice a year during the active growing season is sufficient, as native soils are not typically overly rich.
