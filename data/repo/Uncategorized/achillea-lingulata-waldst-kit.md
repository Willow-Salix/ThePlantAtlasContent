## 🌱 Overview
Achillea  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The plants typically have frilly leaves and are known colloquially as yarrows, although this common name usually refers to A. millefolium. The genus was named after the Greek mythological character Achilles, whose soldiers were said to have used yarrow to treat their wounds; this is reflected by common names such as allheal and bloodwort. The genus is native primarily to Eurasia and North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy alpine plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or borders. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and apply minimal fertilizer to promote robust flowering and compact growth. Ensure good air circulation and avoid waterlogging to prevent issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; this plant thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering. An annual application of compost or a very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth appears weak.
