## 🌱 Overview
Viburnum is a genus of about 150–175 species of flowering plants in the moschatel family, Adoxaceae or its alternative name Viburnaceae. Its current classification is based on molecular phylogeny. It was previously included in the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae.
The member species are evergreen or deciduous shrubs or (in a few cases) small trees native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species extending into tropical montane regions in South America and southeast Asia. In Africa, the genus is confined to the Atlas Mountains.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mapleleaf Viburnum thrives in conditions similar to its native temperate forest understory, requiring partial to full shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Minimal fertilization with organic matter or a slow-release product helps maintain its health and vigor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from an annual application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a layer of compost/organic matter in early spring.
