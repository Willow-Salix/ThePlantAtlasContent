## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stahl's Staggerbush thrives in conditions similar to its native subtropical montane wet forests, requiring consistently moist, well-draining, and acidic soil. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and fertilize sparingly with a suitable acid-loving formula.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with an acid-forming or slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season. Ericaceae are generally adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils, so avoid excessive nutrients.
