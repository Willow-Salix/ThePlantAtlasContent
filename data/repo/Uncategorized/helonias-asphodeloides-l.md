## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Swamp Pink, replicate its native bog environment by providing consistently wet, acidic, and nutrient-poor soil. It prefers full sun to partial shade, especially with some protection from intense afternoon sun. Avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to low-nutrient conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. High fertility can be detrimental.
