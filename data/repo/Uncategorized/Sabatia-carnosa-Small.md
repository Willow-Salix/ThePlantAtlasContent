## 🌱 Overview
Sabatia, the rose gentians, is a genus of about 20 species of flowering plants in the family Gentianaceae, native to eastern and central North America (Nova Scotia west to Wisconsin and New Mexico, and south to Florida and Texas), Central America, and the Caribbean.
They are annual or perennial herbaceous plants growing to 10–130 cm tall, with opposite leaves. The flowers are produced in large cymes at the top of the stems; the flower corolla has 5–12 lobes, colored pink or white, with a contrasting central yellow 'eye'. The fruit is a capsule containing numerous small seeds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pink Meadow Beauty thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, never letting the soil dry out. Due to its native boggy habitat, it prefers low to moderate fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage while maintaining constant moisture.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as native bog and savanna soils are typically acidic and nutrient-poor; over-fertilization can be detrimental.
