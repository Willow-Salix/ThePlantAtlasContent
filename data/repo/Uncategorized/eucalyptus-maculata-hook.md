# Spotted Gum
### *Eucalyptus maculata Hook.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern Australia (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Warm Temperate Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure is essential, as it thrives in open, unshaded woodlands and forests. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers well-drained soil; regular watering for young trees to establish. Once mature, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal supplementary watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Spotted gum usually refers to the Australian tree species Corymbia maculata but may also refer to other closely related species within the genus Corymbia as follows:

Corymbia citriodora (usually referred to as the lemon-scented gum)

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spotted Gum thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its native open woodland habitat. Young plants need regular watering for establishment, but mature trees are very drought-tolerant. Fertilization should be minimal, as these plants are adapted to poorer soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer sparingly for young plants; established trees rarely need fertilization.
