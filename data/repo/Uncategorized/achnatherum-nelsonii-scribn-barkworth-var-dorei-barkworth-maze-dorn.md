## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically Alberta and British Columbia in Canada, and Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho in the United States. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Montane Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to mimic its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings, especially during hot, dry periods. Requires less water than typical garden plants. |

## 🌱 Overview
Achnatherum is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It includes 20 species of needlegrass native to temperate Eurasia and North Africa. Several needlegrass species have been switched between Achnatherum and genus Stipa; taxonomy between the two closely related genera is still uncertain. In 2019 Peterson et al. reorganized the genera in tribe Stipeae based on molecular DNA studies, and placed the species from the Americas into other genera.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Nelson's Needlegrass var. dorei thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, being highly drought-tolerant once established. It requires minimal watering and fertilization, preferring lean soils over rich ones, making it a low-maintenance choice for appropriate climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is needed, as it is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils. Excessive fertilization can lead to weak, floppy growth.
