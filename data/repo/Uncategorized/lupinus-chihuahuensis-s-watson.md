| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily). Thrives in intense, unfiltered solar radiation, typical of desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly and infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, as consistent moisture can lead to root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Chihuahuan Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native arid scrubland and desert environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, with minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere, reducing the need for external nitrogen fertilization. A light application of compost or a low-nitrogen, balanced fertilizer may be beneficial in very poor soils.
