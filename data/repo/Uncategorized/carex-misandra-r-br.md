| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, exposed conditions typical of its native habitat, tolerating long daylight hours with lower sun intensity. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist soil during the growing season, mimicking conditions from snowmelt. Tolerant of cool, wet conditions but also capable of enduring short dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy sedge thrives in cool, open environments, requiring full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil during the growing season. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor tundra conditions. It's well-suited for alpine gardens or cold climate landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Tundra soils are naturally lean and nutrient-poor, so minimal to no fertilization is required. If necessary, a light application of a slow-release, balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient.
