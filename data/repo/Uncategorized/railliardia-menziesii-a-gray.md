## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (Maui, Hawaiʻi) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine Shrubland and Alpine Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring intense direct light for most of the day, typical of high-altitude exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Tolerant of dry periods but benefits from occasional deep watering, mimicking fog drip or infrequent rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dubautia or na'ena'e is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. The genus was named after Joseph Eugène DuBaut (1796–1832), an officer in the French Navy who participated in Freycinet's expedition.
The entire genus is endemic to Hawaii. It contains more species than the other two genera in the silversword alliance, including cushion plants, shrubs, trees, and lianas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian endemic requires full, intense sun and extremely well-draining, lean soil. Water moderately, allowing the substrate to dry out between applications, and avoid rich fertilizers. It thrives in cool subalpine to alpine conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in nutrient-poor, well-draining volcanic soils. Avoid rich fertilizers which can harm the plant.
