## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States, West Indies, Mexico, Central and South America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Wetland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in bright, direct light conditions typical of open marshlands. |
| **💧 Water** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, as it naturally grows in boggy or marshy areas. Should not be allowed to dry out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
White Star Grass requires abundant sunlight and consistently wet soil conditions to mimic its native subtropical wetland habitat. Ensure the plant never dries out and provide bright light for optimal growth. Fertilize lightly during active growth periods.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate. Benefits from occasional feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season, but is not a heavy feeder.
