## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering due to its native arid grassland climate. Avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Allow the soil to dry thoroughly between infrequent waterings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to None. Over-fertilization can harm the plant. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is optional for very poor soils.
