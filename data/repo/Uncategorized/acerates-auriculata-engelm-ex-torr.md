## 🌱 Overview
Asclepias is a genus of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants known as milkweeds, named for their latex, a milky substance containing cardiac glycosides termed cardenolides, exuded where cells are damaged. Most species are toxic to humans and many other species, primarily due to the presence of cardenolides. However, as with many such plants, some species feed upon milkweed leaves or the nectar from their flowers. A noteworthy feeder on milkweeds is the monarch butterfly, which uses and requires certain milkweeds as host plants for its larvae.
The Asclepias genus contains over 200 species distributed broadly across Africa, North America, and South America. It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant milkweed thrives in full sun conditions, replicating its native arid scrubland environment. It requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions to prevent root rot. Fertilization is generally not needed, as it prefers lean, well-draining soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; thrives in lean soils. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring if growth appears sluggish in very poor soils.
