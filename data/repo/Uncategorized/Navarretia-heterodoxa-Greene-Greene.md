## 🌱 Overview
Navarretia is a genus of flowering plants related to the phloxes and the gilias. This is one genus of plants, among others, which are sometimes called pincushion plants. It includes 45 species native to the Americas. In North America they range from western Canada through the western and west-central United States to northwestern Mexico, and to Ohio and Pennsylvania. In South America they range through Argentina and Chile.
The inflorescence which bears the flowers is surrounded by frilly green bracts bearing soft spines, giving it the appearance of a pincushion. Several species are members of the vernal pool ecosystem.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Calistoga Pincushionplant is an annual that thrives in full sun and requires abundant water during its winter and spring growth phase to simulate vernal pool conditions. As summer approaches and the plant completes its life cycle, allow the soil to dry out completely, and keep fertilization to a minimum.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. A single application of a very light, balanced fertilizer might be beneficial early in the growing season, but avoid over-fertilization.
