## 🌱 Overview
Melica is a genus of perennial grasses known generally as melic or melic grass. They are found in most temperate regions of the world.

Melic grasses are clumping to short-rhizomatous grasses. They have flowering culms up to 250 cm (98 in) tall bearing spikelets of papery flowers. The spikelets have between one and seven fertile flowers with a rudimentary structure at the distal end composed of one to four sterile florets. Some species of melic have corms, lending them the name oniongrass.
The genus is most diverse in South America and temperate Asia. Eight species are endemic to China. In North America, most species occur west of the Mississippi River, with exceptions being Melica mutica and M. nitens which occur throughout much of the southeast and lower Midwest respectively.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This grass thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moderate to low watering, being quite drought-tolerant once established due to its bulbous base. It requires minimal fertilization, adapting well to native soil conditions found in its Western North American habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to naturally occurring soil nutrients, excessive fertilization is not required.
