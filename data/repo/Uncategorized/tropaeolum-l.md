# Nasturtium
### *Tropaeolum L.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Andean regions of South America, including Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Mountainous |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. While native high-altitude conditions often mean intense sun, cooler temperatures and moisture in these areas suggest that some shade can be beneficial in hot climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering, keeping the soil consistently moist but ensuring good drainage. They are adapted to periods of rain followed by drier spells, indicating a need for consistent moisture without waterlogging. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Nasturtiums thrive in full sun to partial shade, requiring regular moisture in well-draining soil to mimic their native mountainous habitats. Avoid over-fertilizing, as this can hinder flowering and promote only leafy growth, aligning with their preference for lean to moderately fertile conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Native to areas with often lean to moderately fertile soils, too much rich soil or nitrogen can lead to excessive foliage at the expense of flowers.
