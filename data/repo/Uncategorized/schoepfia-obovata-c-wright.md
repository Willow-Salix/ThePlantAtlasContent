## 🧤 Care Instructions
White Beefwood thrives in warm, sunny conditions with well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Caribbean dry forest habitats. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between applications, and reduce watering in cooler or dormant periods. Provide a light, balanced fertilizer during active growth to support its development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula during the active growing season (spring and summer). It is adapted to soils that are not exceptionally rich.
