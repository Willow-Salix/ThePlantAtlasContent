## 🧤 Care Instructions
Kathul Mountain Draba thrives in full sun and requires exceptionally well-drained, gritty or rocky soil to mimic its native alpine tundra habitat. Water moderately during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and provide minimal to no fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental; a light, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring, or none at all, is sufficient.
