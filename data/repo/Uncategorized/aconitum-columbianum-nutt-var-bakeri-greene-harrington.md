## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Aconitum variety thrives in conditions similar to its native Rocky Mountain habitat. Provide full sun in cool, high-altitude regions or partial shade in warmer areas, alongside consistently moist, well-draining, and fertile soil. Regular watering is essential to prevent drying out, mimicking its natural preference for moist stream banks and meadows.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, organic-rich feed in early spring, particularly if the soil is not naturally rich. Prefers humus-rich, well-draining soil.
