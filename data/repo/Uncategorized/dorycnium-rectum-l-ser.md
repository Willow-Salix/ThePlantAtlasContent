## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, including Southern Europe (e.g., Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece), North Africa (e.g., Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia), and parts of Western Asia (e.g., Turkey). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Sclerophyll Shrubland/Woodland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) to partial sun. Prefers full sun for best growth and flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring less water during hot, dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lotus, a latinization of Greek lōtos (λωτός), is a genus of flowering plants that includes most bird's-foot trefoils (also known as bacon-and-eggs) and deervetches. Depending on the taxonomic authority, roughly between 70 and 150 species are accepted, all legumes; American species formerly placed in the genus have been transferred to other genera. Lotus species are found in the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to a wide range of habitats.
The aquatic plant commonly known as the Indian or sacred lotus is Nelumbo nucifera, a species not closely related to Lotus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Mediterranean native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, exhibiting good drought tolerance once established. Water moderately during its active growth period, reducing frequency in summer. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires very little fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. If growth seems poor, a balanced, low-phosphorus fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
