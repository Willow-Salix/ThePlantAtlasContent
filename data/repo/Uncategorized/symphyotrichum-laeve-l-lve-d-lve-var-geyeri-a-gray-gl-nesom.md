## 🌱 Overview
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Geyer's Aster prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native prairie and open woodland habitats. It's moderately drought-tolerant once established and generally does not require extensive fertilization, performing best in average to rich garden soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in average to rich, well-draining soil. Does not typically require heavy fertilization; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil quality is poor.
