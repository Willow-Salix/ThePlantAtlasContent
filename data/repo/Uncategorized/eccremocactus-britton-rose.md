## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a jungle cactus, Eccremocactus thrives in conditions that mimic its native tropical forest habitat, preferring bright, indirect light and consistent moisture during active growth. Ensure excellent drainage and allow slight drying between waterings to prevent root rot. Reduce watering and halt fertilization during its winter dormancy period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize monthly during the active growing season with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 or bloom-boosting formula). Do not fertilize in winter.
