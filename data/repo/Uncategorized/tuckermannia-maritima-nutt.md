# Sea Dahlia
### *Tuckermannia maritima Nutt.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal Southern California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (Coastal Chaparral/Scrubland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight) for robust growth and abundant flowering, tolerating some partial sun in the hottest regions. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate watering during its spring growing season. Becomes highly drought-tolerant once established and needs very little to no water during its summer dormancy, especially in well-draining soils. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient perennial thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, typical of its native Mediterranean coastal environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established, particularly during its summer dormancy, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean, poor to average soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, but avoid over-fertilizing.
