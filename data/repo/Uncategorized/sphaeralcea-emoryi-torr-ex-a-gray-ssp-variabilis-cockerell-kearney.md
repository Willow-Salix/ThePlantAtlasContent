| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, Nevada, California) and Northwestern Mexico (Baja California, Sonora) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |

## 🌱 Overview
Sphaeralcea is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family (Malvaceae). There are about 40-60 species, including annuals, perennials, and shrubs. Most originate in the drier regions of North America, with some known from South America. They are commonly known as globemallows, globe mallows, false mallows or falsemallows. The name of the genus is derived from the Greek words σφαῖρα (sphaira), meaning "sphere," and αλκεα (alkea), meaning "mallow."
The leaves of these plants are spirally arranged, and usually palmate or toothed. Both stems and leaves are downy. Like other Malvaceae, the flowers are saucer- or cup-shaped, with the stamens joined into a column in the center.
Sphaeralcea species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia olivacea, which has been recorded on S. lindheimeri.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Emory's Globemallow is a hardy desert plant requiring full sun and minimal water, thriving in arid conditions. Plant in well-draining soil and avoid over-fertilizing, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between infrequent waterings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor desert soils and typically does not require fertilization. Excessive fertilizer can promote weak, leggy growth.
