## 🧤 Care Instructions
Curtiss' Evening Primrose thrives in full sun and very well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its native habitat in the southeastern US. Provide moderate watering, ensuring the soil dries between applications, and avoid heavy fertilization as it prefers lean conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in lean to average soils and does not require heavy fertilization. Over-fertilization can reduce flowering.
