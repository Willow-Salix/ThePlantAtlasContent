## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical and subtropical grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Provide moderate, consistent watering during its active growing season, allowing the soil surface to dry slightly between applications. It requires minimal fertilization for healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a grass often found in disturbed or less fertile areas, it does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during its active growth period is generally sufficient.
