## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Nearly cosmopolitan, found across temperate and subtropical regions of North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate and Subtropical Woodlands, Heathlands, Moorlands, and Open Fields. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial Sun to Full Sun (tolerates a wide range of light conditions, preferring brighter spots in cooler climates and some shade in hotter climates). |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage; allow the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent waterlogging and root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bracken (Pteridium) is a genus of large, cosmopolitan, coarse ferns in the family Dennstaedtiaceae. Ferns (Pteridophyta) are vascular plants that undergo alternation of generations, having both large plants (sporophytes) that produce spores and small plants (gametophytes) that produce sex cells (eggs and sperm) in its life cycle. Brackens are noted for their large, highly divided leaves. They are found on all continents except Antarctica, though their typical habitat is moorland.  The genus probably has the widest distribution of any fern in the world. 
The word bracken is of Old Norse origin, related to Swedish bräken and Danish bregne, both meaning fern. In the past, the genus was commonly treated as having only one species, Pteridium aquilinum, but the recent trend is to subdivide it into about ten species.
Like other ferns, brackens do not have seeds or fruit, but reproduce by spores. The immature fronds, known as fiddleheads, are sometimes eaten, although some are thought to be carcinogenic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bracken fern is a highly adaptable and robust plant, thriving in a wide range of light from partial to full sun. It prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil and has low to moderate fertilizer requirements, making it relatively easy to care for in suitable environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs; an annual application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring is typically sufficient, especially in naturally poor soils. Avoid over-fertilization.
