## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical grass thrives in full sun conditions, much like its native savanna habitat. It prefers moderate watering, allowing for some drying between sessions, and is well-adapted to alkaline soils. Overall, it is a relatively low-maintenance plant suited for sunny, well-drained locations.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Being adapted to limestone soils, it prefers alkaline conditions and does not require rich, heavily fertilized soil. A general-purpose, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
