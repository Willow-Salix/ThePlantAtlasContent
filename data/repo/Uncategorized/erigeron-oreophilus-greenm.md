## 🧤 Care Instructions
Chaparral Fleabane prefers full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native chaparral environment. It needs moderate watering in spring, becoming very drought-tolerant as summer progresses, and has low nutrient requirements.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in leaner soils; over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if needed.
