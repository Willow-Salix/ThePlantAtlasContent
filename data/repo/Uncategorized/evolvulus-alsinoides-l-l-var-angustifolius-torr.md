## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and requires well-drained soil, tolerating drought conditions once established. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. Fertilization is minimal, making it a low-maintenance choice for warm, sunny environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. An occasional application of a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer once a month during the active growing season is sufficient, as it naturally grows in lean soils.
