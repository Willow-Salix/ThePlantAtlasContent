## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and South America, including southern Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and the West Indies. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Cloud Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight which can scorch leaves, preferring dappled light as an understory epiphyte in its natural habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the central 'tank' (rosette) filled with clean, non-chlorinated water, flushing it weekly. The growing medium should remain consistently moist but well-drained, not waterlogged. High humidity is essential. |

## 🌱 Overview
Guzmania (tufted airplant) is a genus of over 120 species of flowering plants in the botanical family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Tillandsioideae. They are mainly stemless, evergreen, epiphytic perennials native to Brazil, southern Mexico, Central America, and northern and western South America. They are found at altitudes of up to 3,500 m (11,483 ft) in the Andean rainforests.
The genus is named after Spanish-Ecuadorian pharmacist and naturalist, Anastasio Guzmán.
Several species of this genus are cultivated as indoor and outdoor garden plants. The best known is Guzmania lingulata (scarlet star) which bears orange and red bracts.
The plant dies after it has produced its flowers in summer, but new plants can easily be propagated from the offsets which appear as the parent plant dies. They are epiphytes and can do well if tied on to pieces of bark with roots bound into sphagnum moss.
Guzmanias require warm temperatures and relatively high humidity. The ascomycete fungus Cochliobolus sativus and other pathogens can cause fatal root rot in plants of this genus if the roots get too wet and cold.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic bromeliad thrives in bright, indirect light and high humidity, typical of its native tropical rainforests. Maintain its central 'tank' with fresh water, ensure consistently moist but well-drained growing medium, and provide very diluted foliar fertilizer during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize sparingly. Use a very diluted (1/8 to 1/4 strength) liquid fertilizer sprayed into the 'tank' or foliage every 2-4 weeks during the growing season. No need for heavy soil fertilization.
