## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun and very dry conditions, reflecting its arid habitat. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization as it is adapted to poor soils. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal intervention once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils. If desired, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once annually in spring.
