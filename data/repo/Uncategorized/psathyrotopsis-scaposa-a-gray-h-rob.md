## 🧤 Care Instructions
Naked Turtleback thrives in conditions mimicking its native Southwestern U.S. desert habitat. Provide full sun and very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between applications, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Fertilizer needs are minimal due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. If fertilized, use a very diluted, low-nitrogen formula once or twice during the growing season, as it naturally thrives in nutrient-poor desert soils.
