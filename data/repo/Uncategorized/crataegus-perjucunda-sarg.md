## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy hawthorn thrives in full sun to partial shade within temperate climates. It prefers moderate watering, especially when young, and established plants are fairly drought-tolerant. Fertilization is generally not necessary, making it a low-maintenance choice.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal, typically not required in average soil. A balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil is very poor.
