## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western and Central North America (e.g., Canada, United States, Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland, Arid Scrubland, Mountain Slopes |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially mimicking dry periods in its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chrysopsis (golden asters) are plants in the family Asteraceae native to the southern and eastern United States. All the species are found in Florida, although some are found in other states as well.
These are annual and perennial herbs bearing daisy-like flower heads with yellow disc florets and usually yellow ray florets. Some species formerly classified in this genus are now included in other genera: Heterotheca, Pityopsis, Stenotus, Ionactis, Aster, Eucephalus, Erigeron, Machaeranthera, Croptilon, Xanthisma, Oclemena, Bradburia, Oxypappus, Arnica, and Helichrysopsis.
Golden asters are often used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Schinia petulans (which feeds exclusively on C. subulata).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Leafy Goldenaster is a resilient plant thriving in full sun and well-draining soil, reflective of its native arid to semi-arid environments. It requires minimal watering once established and generally does not need heavy fertilization. This makes it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or rock gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth. A light application of balanced granular fertilizer in spring, or none at all, is generally sufficient.
