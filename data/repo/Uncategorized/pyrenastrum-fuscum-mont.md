## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen requires a consistently humid environment with ample atmospheric moisture and protection from direct sunlight. It thrives on bark or rock in conditions mimicking its tropical rainforest origin, absorbing all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere and rain.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
