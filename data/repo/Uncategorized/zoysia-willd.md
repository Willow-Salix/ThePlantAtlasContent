## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australia, particularly coastal and open grassland regions. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Grassland and Coastal Zones, characterized by warm temperatures and distinct wet/dry seasons or consistent moderate rainfall. |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun for optimal growth, ideally receiving 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with its origins in open, exposed environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Needs moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. While it demonstrates significant drought tolerance once established, regular irrigation during prolonged dry spells is beneficial, reflecting the seasonal rainfall patterns of its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Zoysia (UK: ; US: , -, -, -) is a genus of creeping grasses widespread across much of Asia and Australia, as well as various islands in the Pacific. These species, commonly called zoysia or zoysiagrass, are found in coastal areas or grasslands. It is a popular choice for fairways and teeing areas at golf courses.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Zoysiagrass is a warm-season grass thriving in full sun and warm temperatures. It requires moderate watering, tolerating drought exceptionally well once its deep root system is established. Nutrient requirements are relatively low, making it a low-maintenance option for a durable lawn.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Has relatively low to moderate fertilizer needs. It benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer application 1-2 times per year during its active growing season to maintain density and color, consistent with its adaptation to various soil types in its native range.
