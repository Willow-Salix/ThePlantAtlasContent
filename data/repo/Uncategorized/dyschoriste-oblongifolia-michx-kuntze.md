## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Oblongleaf Snakeherb, provide full sun to partial shade conditions and ensure well-draining soil, mimicking its native pine flatwood and sandhill environments. Water regularly to keep the soil moist but avoid waterlogging, allowing the top layer to dry between waterings. Fertilization needs are low; a light application during the growing season is generally adequate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, particularly in sandy or less fertile soils.
