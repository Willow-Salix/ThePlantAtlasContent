## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions across Europe, North America, and Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (conditions suitable for its lichen hosts) |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect light to dappled shade, mimicking conditions favorable for its host lichens. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular moisture and high humidity, avoiding desiccation, similar to temperate forest understory conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Tremella is a genus of fungi in the family Tremellaceae. All Tremella species are parasites of other fungi and most produce anamorphic yeast states. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies), when produced, are gelatinous and are colloquially classed among the "jelly fungi". Over 100 species of Tremella (in its wide sense) are currently recognized worldwide. One species, Tremella fuciformis, is commercially cultivated for food.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cultivating Tremella haematommatis Diederich requires providing suitable conditions for its specific lichen host, primarily Haematomma species. This involves maintaining consistent moderate humidity, indirect light, and a stable, unpolluted environment typical of temperate forests where these lichens thrive naturally.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; this fungus obtains nutrients directly from its lichen host. Ensuring the host lichen thrives naturally provides its nutrient source.
