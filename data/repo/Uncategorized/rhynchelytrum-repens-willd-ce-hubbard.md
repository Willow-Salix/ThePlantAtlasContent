## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Africa (e.g., South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe) and other parts of tropical Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Savanna and Subtropical Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is ideal for vigorous growth, reflecting its open grassland origins. |
| **💧 Water** | Water regularly during its active growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic savanna wet/dry cycles. It is highly drought-tolerant once established. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pink Natal Grass thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, tolerating dry conditions well once established. Mimicking its native savanna environment, it requires regular watering during its active growing season, followed by drier periods. Fertilization needs are minimal.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder. A single application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, or it may not require any in reasonably fertile soils.
