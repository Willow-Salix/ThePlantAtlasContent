| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah) and Baja California, Mexico, particularly in the Mojave Desert region. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily). This plant thrives in high light conditions typical of desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Low. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to sparse desert rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chaenactis macrantha is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family known by the common names bighead dustymaiden and Mojave pincushion. It is native to the Great Basin and the southwestern deserts of the United States, in California, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, southwestern Idaho, and southeastern Oregon. It grows in dry, open habitat with gravelly, sandy soils, often calcareous or alkaline in nature.
Chaenactis macrantha is an annual herb growing one or more branching stems to 30 - 35 centimeters (12-14 inches) in maximum height. The leaves are a few centimeters long and divided into many lobes. The inflorescence bears one or more flower heads on long peduncles. The flower head is lined with woolly phyllaries which have recurved tips.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Mojave Pincushion is a resilient desert plant that demands full sun and excellent drainage to mimic its native arid environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely, and avoid over-fertilization, as it thrives on neglect in suitable conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky desert soils and does not require frequent fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
