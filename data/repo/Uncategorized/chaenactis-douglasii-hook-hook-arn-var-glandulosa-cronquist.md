## 🌱 Overview
Chaenactis is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae which are known generally as pincushions and dustymaidens.
These wildflowers are native to western North America, especially the desert southwest of the United States. They are quite variable in appearance. They are generally aster-like in appearance with many disc florets in each head. There may be only disc florets, but sometimes there are also enlarged ray florets along the edges of the corolla. They may be white to yellow or pink.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Douglas' Dustymaiden thrives in full sun and requires very little water, reflecting its native arid scrubland habitat. It prefers well-drained, lean soils and generally does not need fertilization. The key to its care is mimicking dry, sunny conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Native to lean, well-drained soils, excessive nutrients can be detrimental. If needed, a very dilute, low-phosphorus fertilizer once a year might suffice for potted plants.
