## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Sierra Nevada foothills, Transverse Ranges, California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Chaparral and Foothill Woodlands) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, especially benefitting from afternoon shade in hotter climates to prevent scorching. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during its active growth period in winter and spring, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Requires minimal to no water during its summer dormancy, being drought-tolerant once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Delphinium thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean climate, preferring full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. Provide moderate water during its spring growing season, drastically reducing it during its summer dormancy. Fertilization should be minimal, especially in naturally fertile soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, particularly in poor soils. Avoid over-fertilizing.
