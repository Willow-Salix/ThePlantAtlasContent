## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest and Thorn Scrub |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun is preferred, mimicking its open native habitats. It can tolerate partial shade, but flowering may be reduced. |
| **💧 Water** | Water regularly during the active growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Significantly reduce watering during cooler or dormant periods to prevent root rot, as it is adapted to seasonal drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Thevetia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae, first described for modern science as a genus in 1758. It is native to Mexico, Central America, South America, and Cuba. The taxonomy of the genus is controversial, with some authors including Cascabela within Thevetia, while others accept the two genera as separate.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Thevetia, provide abundant sunlight, mirroring its native tropical dry forest environment. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, and reduce watering during dormancy. Use a balanced fertilizer sparingly during its active growth period to support healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize moderately with a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Avoid over-fertilization, especially during dormant phases.
