## 🌱 Overview
Vachellia is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae, commonly known as thorn trees or acacias. It belongs to the subfamily Mimosoideae. Its species were considered members of genus Acacia until 2009. Vachellia can be distinguished from other acacias by its capitate inflorescences and spinescent stipules. Before discovery of the New World, Europeans in the Mediterranean region were familiar with several species of Vachellia, which they knew as sources of medicine, and had names for them that they inherited from the Greeks and Romans.
The wide-ranging genus occurs in a variety of open, tropical to subtropical habitats, and is locally dominant. In parts of Africa, Vachellia species are shaped progressively by grazing animals of increasing size and height, such as gazelle, gerenuk, and giraffe. The genus in Africa has thus developed thorns in defence against such herbivory.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Whitethorn acacia is a resilient desert plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering once established, and has minimal fertilizer needs. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary, or a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring can be beneficial for potted plants or very poor soils.
