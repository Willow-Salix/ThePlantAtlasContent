## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wandflowers, native to the Mediterranean climate of South Africa, thrive in full sun and well-draining soil. They require consistent moisture during their active growing period in cooler months, followed by a crucial dry dormancy during the summer. Fertilization should be minimal, reflecting the low-nutrient conditions of their natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as their native Fynbos soils are often nutrient-poor; a balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
