## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America (e.g., Alaska, Canadian Arctic, Western USA mountains, Pacific Northwest) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Subarctic, Boreal Forest margins |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. Tolerates direct sun in very cool, moist conditions but generally prefers protection from intense midday sun. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity and frequent moisture exposure are critical. Requires daily misting or placement in a consistently humid environment (e.g., terrarium). Absorbs water directly from the air and precipitation; does not have traditional root-based watering needs. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cetraria is a genus of fruticose lichens that associate with green algae as photobionts. Most species are found at high latitudes, occurring on sand or heath, and are characterised by their "strap-like" form with spiny lobe edges. The lobes can range from narrow and linear to broader and flattened, often forming loose or densely packed cushions. Their distinctive spiny margins serve both a defensive role and aid in vegetative reproduction through fragmentation. The genus was created by Erik Acharius in 1803 and belongs to the large family Parmeliaceae. While originally a species-rich genus, taxonomic revisions since the 1960s have split many species into new genera, though the exact circumscription remains debated among lichenologists.
Several Cetraria species have cultural and economic importance, particularly C. islandica (Iceland moss), which has been widely used in European traditional medicine for treating digestive and respiratory ailments. This species was also historically important as a famine food in Northern Europe and continues to find applications in modern cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Cetraria species are also ecologically important, serving as indicators of air quality and climate change due to their sensitivity to environmental conditions and ability to accumulate various elements, including potentially toxic heavy metals and radioactive isotopes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, high-humidity environments with bright, indirect light. It requires frequent moisture from misting or a consistently humid microclimate, but also needs to dry out slightly between hydration periods. Avoid all conventional fertilizers as they are harmful; nutrients are absorbed directly from the air and water.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Conventional fertilizers are detrimental. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air and ambient moisture, and conventional feeding can harm them.
