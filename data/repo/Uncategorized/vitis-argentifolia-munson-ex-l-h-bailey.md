## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers locations with good light exposure for best growth and potential fruiting, often climbing to reach sunlight in its native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during the growing season. Tolerates some drought once established but thrives with regular watering, mimicking its native habitat along stream banks and moist woodlands. |

## 🌱 Overview
Vitis (grapevine) is a genus of 81 accepted species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae.  The genus consists of species predominantly from the Northern Hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture.
Most cultivated Vitis varieties are wind-pollinated with hermaphroditic flowers containing both male and female reproductive structures, while wild species are dioecious. These flowers are grouped in bunches called inflorescences. In many species, such as Vitis vinifera, each successfully pollinated flower becomes a grape berry with the inflorescence turning into a cluster of grapes. While the flowers of the grapevines are usually very small, the berries are often large and brightly colored with sweet flavors that attract birds and other animals to disperse the seeds contained within the berries.
Grapevines usually only produce fruit on shoots that came from buds that were developed during the previous growing season. In viticulture, this is one of the principles behind pruning the previous year's growth (or "One year old wood") that includes shoots that have turned hard and woody during the winter (after harvest in commercial viticulture). These vines will be pruned either into a cane which will support 8 to 15 buds or to a smaller spur which holds 2 to 3 buds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Silverleaf Grape thrives in a humid subtropical woodland environment, requiring full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide moderate fertility, avoiding over-fertilization, to support healthy growth and potential fruiting.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Benefits from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer in spring, especially if soil is poor. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush foliage at the expense of fruit production.
