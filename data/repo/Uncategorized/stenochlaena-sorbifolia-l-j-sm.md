## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, including Southeast Asia (e.g., Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines), parts of West and Central Africa, and tropical Northern Australia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Protect from intense, direct sunlight, especially during peak hours. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Requires high humidity, mimicking its native swamp and riverbank habitats. Water frequently, ensuring good drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Stenochlaena is a genus of ferns of the plant family Blechnaceae. Six species were formally accepted in an April 2013 scientific review of the genus, first written some years earlier and submitted in 2009. One additional species S. hainanensis awaits confirmation of its difference from S. palustris by means of differences in fertile material and/or its formal publication. One additional likely species grows naturally in Cameroon, Africa, recognised with the descriptive name Stenochlaena sp. 'Cameroon' but it awaits formal description.
Some species of Stenochlaena are common climbing ferns in South-East Asian rainforests.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This vigorous tropical climbing fern thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light or partial shade, avoiding direct sun. Maintain consistently moist soil and high ambient humidity, characteristic of its native swampy habitats, and feed regularly during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize monthly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler months.
