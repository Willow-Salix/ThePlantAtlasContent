## 🧤 Care Instructions
Buckley's Spiderwort thrives in bright indirect to partial sun and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Water regularly, allowing slight drying between waterings, and provide moderate fertilizer during its growth period. This approach mimics its native humid subtropical prairie and woodland environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer). Native soils in its habitat are typically moderately fertile, benefiting from occasional nutrient replenishment.
