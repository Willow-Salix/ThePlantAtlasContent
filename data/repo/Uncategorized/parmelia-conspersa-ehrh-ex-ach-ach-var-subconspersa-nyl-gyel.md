| **🌍 Origin** | Globally widespread in temperate and boreal regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and South Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Exposed rocky habitats within temperate and boreal zones, often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and mountainous areas. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers high light levels to full sun exposure, as it typically grows on exposed rock surfaces with minimal shading. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies on natural rainfall, fog, or atmospheric moisture. Highly tolerant of drought; does not require frequent watering and should not be kept constantly wet. Water uptake is direct from the thallus surface. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions on rocks, relying solely on environmental moisture and atmospheric nutrients. Avoid overwatering and traditional fertilization, as it is highly adapted to periods of dryness and minimal nutrient input.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Obtains necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rain) and mineral traces leached from its substrate. Fertilizers can be detrimental.
