## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen thrives in consistently humid and shaded environments, mimicking its native temperate forest habitat. It requires high ambient humidity and indirect light, absorbing moisture and nutrients directly from the air and rainfall, thus requiring no traditional fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required; this lichen obtains its nutrients from airborne particles, rainfall, and substances leaching from its host substrate (tree bark).
