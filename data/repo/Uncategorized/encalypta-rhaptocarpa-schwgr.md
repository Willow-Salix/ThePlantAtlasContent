## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient moss thrives in cool, exposed alpine and boreal conditions. Provide full sun to partial shade, ensuring the substrate remains consistently moist but well-drained. Fertilization should be minimal to none for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is needed. If growth is exceptionally poor, a highly diluted (1/10 strength) balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied very sparingly once a year.
