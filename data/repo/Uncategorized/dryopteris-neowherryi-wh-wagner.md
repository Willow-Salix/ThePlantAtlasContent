## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Dappled shade to partial shade. Avoid direct, intense sunlight, especially during the hot afternoon hours, as it can scorch the fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking the humid understory of its native forest. |

## 🌱 Overview
The moth genus Dryopteris is now considered a junior synonym of Oreta.

Dryopteris , commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to Dryopteris filix-mas), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales.
Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American Dryopteris hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization.
The fossil record of this genus shows that it was widespread even as far back as the Cretaceous with fossils being found in Late Cretaceous rock layers from North America down to Antarctica.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This woodfern prefers conditions similar to its native temperate forest floor, requiring dappled to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained, organically rich soil. Protect it from direct sun and provide regular watering to maintain humidity around the plant. Fertilize sparingly during the active growing season.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. Use a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer once or twice during the growing season (spring/early summer). Rich, organic soil is preferred.
