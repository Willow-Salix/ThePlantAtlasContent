## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (United States, particularly the Intermountain West including Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland, Desert, Sagebrush Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native desert and scrubland environment. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent deep watering; highly drought-tolerant once established. Allow soil to dry completely between waterings, mimicking sporadic desert rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chrysothamnus, known as rabbitbrush, rabbitbush, and chamisa, are a genus of shrubs in the family Asteraceae. The native distribution is in the arid western United States, Canada, and northern Mexico. It is known for its bright white or yellow flowers in late summer.
Chrysothamnus may grow up to a 120 cm (47 in) tall shrub or subshrub, usually with woody stem bases.  The leaves are alternate, sessile or with short petioles, with entire edges. The flowerheads are singular or in clusters. Each composite flower often has five to 6 (though sometimes upwards of 40) yellow disc florets and no ray florets.
Chrysothamnus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora linosyridella, Coleophora viscidiflorella (which have both been recorded on C. viscidiflorus) and Schinia walsinghami.
