## 🌱 Overview
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in consistently moist to wet soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native wetland habitats. Ensure the soil never dries out, and provide moderate fertilization during its active growth phase for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate, as it often grows in fertile, silty soils. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied lightly during the growing season.
