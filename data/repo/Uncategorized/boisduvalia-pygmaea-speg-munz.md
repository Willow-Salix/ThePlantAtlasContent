## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Argentina, Chile |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Semi-Arid Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun; requires direct sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily to thrive, typical of open steppe environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is adapted to periods of drought in its native semi-arid habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Epilobium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae, containing about 197 species. The genus has a worldwide distribution. It is most prevalent in the subarctic, temperate and subantarctic regions, whereas in the subtropics and tropics Epilobium species are restricted to the cool montane biomes, such as the New Guinea Highlands.
The taxonomy of the genus has varied between different botanists, but the modern trend is to include the previously recognised genera Boisduvalia, Chamaenerion (previously Chamerion), Pyrogennema and Zauschneria within Epilobium according to Peter H. Raven, who has extensively studied the willowherbs and merges the other segregate genera into Epilobium. Fringed willowherb (Epilobium ciliatum) is likely a cryptic species complex; apparently these plants also commonly hybridize with their congeners.
Most species are known by the common name willowherbs for their willow-like leaves. Those that were once separated in Boisduvalia are called spike-primroses or boisduvalias. Those Epilobium species previously placed in the Chamaenerion group are known as fireweeds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Boisduvalia pygmaea is an annual herb from the temperate grasslands and semi-arid steppes of Argentina and Chile. It requires full sun exposure and well-drained soil, thriving with moderate watering that allows for dry periods between applications. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to leaner native soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization; prefers lean to moderately fertile soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost annually should suffice.
