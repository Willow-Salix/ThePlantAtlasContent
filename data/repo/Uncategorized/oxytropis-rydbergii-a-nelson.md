## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains region of the United States and Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane/Subalpine Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive in conditions similar to open meadows and dry slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is crucial to ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot, mimicking its native well-drained, often rocky soils. |

## 🌱 Overview
Oxytropis is a genus of plants in the legume family. It includes over 600 species native to subarctic to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. It is one of three genera of plants known as locoweeds, and are notorious for being toxic to grazing animals. The other locoweed genus is the closely related Astragalus. Most oxtropis species are native to Eurasia and North America, but several species are native to the Arctic. These are hairy perennial plants which produce raceme inflorescences of pink, purple, white, or yellow flowers which are generally pea-like but have distinctive sharply beaked keels. The stems are leafless, the leaves being all basal. The plant produces legume pods containing the seeds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To successfully cultivate Rydberg's Crazyweed, provide full sun exposure and ensure exceptionally well-drained soil, replicating its montane/subalpine grassland habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions, and use fertilizer sparingly, particularly avoiding high-nitrogen formulas due to its natural nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, Oxytropis rydbergii can fix its own nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. A light application of a balanced or phosphorus-rich fertilizer once a year in spring may be beneficial, but is often not strictly necessary.
