## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Gonzalagunia, provide bright indirect light and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, never allowing it to dry out fully. High humidity is also beneficial, mimicking its native tropical rainforest environment. Fertilize regularly during the growing season to support robust growth.
