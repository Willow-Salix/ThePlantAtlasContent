## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | India, Southeast Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Monsoon Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Avoid direct, intense afternoon sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist during the active growing season (spring to autumn), allowing the top inch to dry slightly between waterings. Reduce watering significantly during dormancy (winter). Ensure excellent drainage to prevent rhizome rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Turmeric (), or Curcuma longa (), is a flowering plant in the ginger family Zingiberaceae. It is a perennial, rhizomatous, herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia that requires temperatures between 20 and 30 °C (68 and 86 °F) and high annual rainfall to thrive. Plants are gathered each year for their rhizomes, some for propagation in the following season and some for consumption or dyeing.
The rhizomes can be used fresh, but they are often boiled in water and dried, after which they are ground into a deep orange-yellow shelf-stable spice powder commonly used as a coloring and flavoring agent in many Asian cuisines, especially for curries (curry powder). Turmeric powder has a warm, bitter, black pepper-like flavor and earthy, mustard-like aroma.
Although long used in Ayurvedic medicine, there is no high-quality clinical evidence that consuming turmeric or the principal turmeric constituent, curcumin, is effective for treating any disease. Curcumin, a bright yellow chemical produced by the turmeric plant, is approved as a food additive by the World Health Organization, European Parliament, and United States Food and Drug Administration. Turmeric and its extract curcumin are generally safe but have recently been linked, especially in high-bioavailability forms, to rare cases of immune-mediated acute liver injury that typically resolve after stopping use, though severe outcomes can occur if use continues.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Turmeric thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It requires consistently moist soil during its active growth period, with a significant reduction in water during dormancy, and benefits from regular feeding with a balanced fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize every 2-4 weeks during the growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer. This mimics the nutrient-rich, yet often leached, soils of its tropical habitat.
