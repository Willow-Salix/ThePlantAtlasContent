## 🌱 Overview
Sphaeralcea is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family (Malvaceae). There are about 40-60 species, including annuals, perennials, and shrubs. Most originate in the drier regions of North America, with some known from South America. They are commonly known as globemallows, globe mallows, false mallows or falsemallows. The name of the genus is derived from the Greek words σφαῖρα (sphaira), meaning "sphere," and αλκεα (alkea), meaning "mallow."
The leaves of these plants are spirally arranged, and usually palmate or toothed. Both stems and leaves are downy. Like other Malvaceae, the flowers are saucer- or cup-shaped, with the stamens joined into a column in the center.
Sphaeralcea species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia olivacea, which has been recorded on S. lindheimeri.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Emory's Globemallow thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, reflecting its arid desert origins. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established. Minimal to no fertilization is necessary for healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Native to lean desert soils, excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth.
