## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical climber thrives in bright, indirect light to partial sun, mimicking its forest edge habitat, and requires consistently moist soil during its active growth. Provide moderate fertilization in spring and summer, and reduce watering in cooler, dormant periods to emulate its native monsoon climate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize monthly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength.
