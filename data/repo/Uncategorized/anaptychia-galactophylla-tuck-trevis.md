| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Typically found on tree bark or rocks, receiving filtered sunlight; avoid harsh, direct afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and frequent wetting, either through natural rainfall, misting, or dew. Absorbs water directly from the air and surface; avoid prolonged dryness or submersion. |

## 🌱 Overview
Anaptychia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. Anaptychia species are foliose (leafy) to fruticose (bushy) lichens. They have brown, thin-walled spores with a single septum, and a prosoplechtenchymatous upper cortex.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This foliose lichen thrives in consistently high humidity and bright, indirect light to partial shade, typically found on tree bark or rocks in warm temperate to tropical regions. It absorbs moisture from the air and rainfall, requiring frequent wetting and misting rather than traditional watering. No fertilizer is needed, as it is highly sensitive to external nutrients and pollutants.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizer. Lichens are highly sensitive to pollutants and derive necessary nutrients from the environment (air, rain, substrate); artificial fertilization can be detrimental.
