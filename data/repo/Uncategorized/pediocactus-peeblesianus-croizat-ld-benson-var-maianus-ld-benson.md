## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arizona, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. Requires direct, intense sunlight for several hours a day to mimic its native exposed desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely drought-tolerant. Water very sparingly and deeply only during the active growing season (spring/early summer), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Keep completely dry during its winter dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pediocactus (Greek: πεδίον (pedion) means "plain", "flat", "field") is a genus of cacti native to the Western United States. The genus comprises between 6 and 11 species, depending upon the authority. Species of this genus are referred to as hedgehog cacti, though that name is also applied to plants from the genera Echinocereus and Echinopsis. Species may also be referred to as pincushion cacti, a common name which is also applied to other genera.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This high desert cactus requires full, direct sun exposure and extremely infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings and remaining dry in winter. Fertilization needs are minimal, with a diluted cactus formula applied only during the active growth period. Proper care mimics its arid native environment to prevent rot and encourage healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Apply a highly diluted, balanced cactus fertilizer once or twice during the growing season (spring/early summer). Do not fertilize during dormancy.
