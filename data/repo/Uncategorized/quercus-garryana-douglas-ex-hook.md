## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Oregon White Oak thrives in full sun and is remarkably drought-tolerant once mature, mirroring its native Mediterranean climate. Young trees need consistent watering to establish a strong root system, but mature trees are low-maintenance, requiring minimal supplemental water or fertilizer in well-drained soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; established trees generally do not require fertilization. Young trees in nutrient-poor soils may benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer to aid in establishment.
