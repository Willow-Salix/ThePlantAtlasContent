## 🧤 Care Instructions
As an epiphytic lichen, Ramalina linearis thrives in environments with high humidity and good air circulation, receiving bright indirect light to partial sun. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and precipitation, requiring no traditional watering or fertilization, making consistent ambient humidity critical for its survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; as a lichen, it obtains all necessary nutrients from airborne particles and rainwater. Traditional fertilizers are detrimental.
