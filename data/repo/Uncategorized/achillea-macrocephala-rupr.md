## 🌱 Overview
Achillea  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The plants typically have frilly leaves and are known colloquially as yarrows, although this common name usually refers to A. millefolium. The genus was named after the Greek mythological character Achilles, whose soldiers were said to have used yarrow to treat their wounds; this is reflected by common names such as allheal and bloodwort. The genus is native primarily to Eurasia and North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Achillea macrocephala, originating from temperate grasslands and subalpine regions, is a hardy perennial that demands full sun and well-drained soil. It exhibits strong drought tolerance once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization to prevent leggy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soils. Over-fertilization can lead to weak, leggy growth. An annual light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, or none if soil is already nutrient-rich.
