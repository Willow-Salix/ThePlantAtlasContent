| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Intermountain West and Great Plains, including states such as Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Grassland and Sagebrush Steppe. Characterized by distinct seasons, with cold winters and hot, often dry, summers; found in open, exposed areas. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in environments with several hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with its native open grassland and sagebrush habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. This plant is drought-tolerant, preferring infrequent but deep watering that allows the soil to dry out completely between sessions. Overwatering, particularly in its dormant phase, should be strictly avoided. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bulbous Springparsley prefers full sun and well-drained, lean soil, mirroring its native arid grassland environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. This makes it a low-maintenance plant suitable for dry, sunny conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Naturally adapted to lean, sandy, or gravelly soils typical of arid regions. If fertilization is deemed necessary, a very dilute, balanced slow-release formula should be applied sparingly during its active growth period.
