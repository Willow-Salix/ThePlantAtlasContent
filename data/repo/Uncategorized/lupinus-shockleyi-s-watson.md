## 🧤 Care Instructions
Purple Desert Lupine thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soil, typical of its arid scrubland origin. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, especially once established. Avoid over-fertilizing, particularly with nitrogen, to encourage healthy blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers lean, well-draining soil and generally does not require fertilization. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen; excessive nitrogen can promote foliage over flowers.
