| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Japan, Korea |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and optimal nut production, replicating its position in the forest canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil. Water regularly, especially during dry periods and the active growing season, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castanea crenata, the Japanese chestnut or Korean chestnut, is a species of chestnut native to Japan and Korea. Castanea crenata exhibits resistance to Phytophthora cinnamomi, the fungal pathogen that causes ink disease in several Castanea species. The mechanism of resistance of Castanea crenata to Phytophthora cinnamomi may derive from its expression of the Cast_Gnk2-like gene.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Japanese Chestnut requires a full sun exposure and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native temperate forest habitat. Regular watering during dry spells and annual fertilization with organic matter or a balanced feed will support healthy growth and nut yield.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in fertile, organically rich soil. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, or annually incorporate compost and other organic matter to replenish nutrients, particularly for young trees and those bearing fruit.
