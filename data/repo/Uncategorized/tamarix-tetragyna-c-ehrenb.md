| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern Mediterranean, Middle East, and North Africa (e.g., Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Libya, Greece, Turkey) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid and Semi-Arid Scrubland; Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, thriving in direct, intense sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate; highly drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially crucial in hot, dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
The genus Tamarix (tamarisk, salt cedar, taray) is composed of about 50–60 species of flowering plants in the family Tamaricaceae, native to drier areas of Eurasia and Africa. The generic name originated in Latin and may refer to the Tamaris River in Hispania Tarraconensis (Spain).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering once established, reflecting its arid native habitat. It is highly tolerant of drought and poor, saline soils, making it a low-maintenance choice. Avoid over-watering and excessive fertilization to ensure optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; naturally adapted to poor, often saline soils. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental; if necessary, a very light, balanced feed once in spring is sufficient.
