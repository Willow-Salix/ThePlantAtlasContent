## 🧤 Care Instructions
Chaparral Mallow thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native arid and chaparral environments. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering once established, and generally needs minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally thrives without heavy fertilization. Native soils in its habitat are not typically rich, so a light application of a balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if desired.
