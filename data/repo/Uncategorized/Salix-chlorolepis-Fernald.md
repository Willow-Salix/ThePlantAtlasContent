## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Greenscale Willow thrives in cold, open environments with abundant moisture. It requires full sun and consistently wet soil conditions, mimicking its native subarctic alpine bog habitats, and has low fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring if growth appears weak, but generally not a heavy feeder.
