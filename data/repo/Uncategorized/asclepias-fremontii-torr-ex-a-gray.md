## 🌱 Overview
Asclepias is a genus of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants known as milkweeds, named for their latex, a milky substance containing cardiac glycosides termed cardenolides, exuded where cells are damaged. Most species are toxic to humans and many other species, primarily due to the presence of cardenolides. However, as with many such plants, some species feed upon milkweed leaves or the nectar from their flowers. A noteworthy feeder on milkweeds is the monarch butterfly, which uses and requires certain milkweeds as host plants for its larvae.
The Asclepias genus contains over 200 species distributed broadly across Africa, North America, and South America. It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fremont's Milkweed thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its arid scrubland origins. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering once established. Fertilization is generally minimal or not required.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilization is often not necessary in suitable native-like soils; a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring may be applied if soil is very poor.
