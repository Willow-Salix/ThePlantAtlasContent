## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal; temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America (e.g., Canada, northern US), Europe, and Asia, often in montane areas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate/Boreal Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light. Thrives in shaded conditions, mimicking its native forest floor environment. Avoid direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged. Requires high humidity; regular misting can be beneficial. Mimic frequent rainfall or constant dampness of its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dicranum is a genus of mosses, also called wind-blown mosses or fork mosses. 
These mosses form in densely packed clumps. Stems may fork, but do not branch. In general, upright stems will be single but packed together. Dicranum is distributed globally. In North America these are commonly found in Jack pine or Red pine stands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Strict Broom Moss thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, emulating its native forest floor habitat. Ensure constant moisture for the substrate and high ambient humidity, while strictly protecting it from any direct sunlight. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its low nutrient requirements.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses obtain most nutrients from water and air. If used at all, apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/10 strength) very sparingly, perhaps once every few months during active growth.
