## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar regions, including arctic and alpine areas of Europe (e.g., Alps, Scandinavia), Asia (e.g., Siberia), and North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Arctic Canada). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, high-altitude boreal zones. |
| **☀️ Light** | High light to full sun exposure, tolerant of harsh UV radiation, as it often grows on exposed rock surfaces in open environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies on atmospheric moisture (rain, snowmelt, dew, fog) for hydration. Tolerant of dry periods, but requires periodic rehydration from environmental moisture. Does not require soil-based watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Aspicilia (sunken disk lichen) is a genus of mostly crustose areolate lichens that grow on rock. Most members have black apothecia discs that are slightly immersed in the areolas, hence the common name"Given the same reason, the  naming of Aspicilia is derived from the Greek word for "shield concave". 
Most of the species of this genus grow on calcareous and acidic rocks and most of the taxa prefer temperate and arctic habitats.
Some members of the genus Aspicilia are pioneer species on granite and other hard rock, after which members of other lichen species may grow on them, such as members of Acarospora.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Rimmed Lichen thrives in cold, high-altitude environments with abundant light. It requires no soil or conventional watering, instead absorbing moisture from the air. Nutrient needs are met naturally from the environment, making external fertilization unnecessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from dust, atmospheric deposition, and the substrate itself (rocks). Conventional fertilizers are unnecessary and potentially harmful.
