## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Siberia (Russia), Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan), Mongolia, China |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Shrubland/Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Shade (prefers good light for best fruiting) |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings; once established, it is somewhat drought-tolerant but appreciates consistent moisture during prolonged dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cotoneaster  is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, native to the Palaearctic region (temperate Asia, Europe, north Africa), with a strong concentration of diversity in the genus in the mountains of southwestern China and the Himalayas. They are related to hawthorns (Crataegus), firethorns (Pyracantha), photinias (Photinia), and rowans (Sorbus).
Depending on the species definition used, between 70 and 300 different species of Cotoneaster are described, with many apomictic microspecies treated as species by some authors, but only as varieties by others.
The majority of species are shrubs from 0.5–5 m (1.6–16.4 ft) tall, varying from ground-hugging prostrate plants to erect shrubs; a few, notably C. frigidus, are small trees up to 15 m (49 ft) tall and 75 cm (30 in) trunk diameter. The prostrate species are mostly alpine plants growing at high altitudes (e.g. C. integrifolius, which grows at 3,000–4,000 m (9,800–13,100 ft) in the Himalayas), while the larger species occur in scrub and woodland gaps at lower altitudes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient shrub thrives in temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade for optimal growth and fruit production. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and provide a light annual feeding in spring. It is relatively low-maintenance once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate, a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring.
