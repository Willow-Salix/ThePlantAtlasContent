## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thornless Honey Locust is a robust and adaptable tree, thriving in full sun across a range of soil types. It requires moderate watering when young but develops excellent drought tolerance once established. Fertilization is rarely needed for mature plants, making it a low-maintenance choice.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not required once established in good soil. A balanced slow-release fertilizer can be used for young trees if growth is slow.
