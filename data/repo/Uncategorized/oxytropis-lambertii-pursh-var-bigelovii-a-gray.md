| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Semi-Arid Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open grassland and prairie habitats. |

## 🌱 Overview
Oxytropis is a genus of plants in the legume family. It includes over 600 species native to subarctic to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. It is one of three genera of plants known as locoweeds, and are notorious for being toxic to grazing animals. The other locoweed genus is the closely related Astragalus. Most oxtropis species are native to Eurasia and North America, but several species are native to the Arctic. These are hairy perennial plants which produce raceme inflorescences of pink, purple, white, or yellow flowers which are generally pea-like but have distinctive sharply beaked keels. The stems are leafless, the leaves being all basal. The plant produces legume pods containing the seeds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Purple locoweed thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its native grassland and steppe environments. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established. Avoid over-fertilization, as this plant fixes its own nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers and provide nutrients only if soil is exceptionally poor.
