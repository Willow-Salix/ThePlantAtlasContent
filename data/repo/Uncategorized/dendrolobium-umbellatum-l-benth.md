## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dendrolobium umbellatum thrives in tropical conditions, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil to mimic its coastal origins. Provide regular watering and moderate fertilization during its active growth periods to ensure healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring to fall) with a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer. Coastal sandy soils are not always nutrient-rich, so consistent but not heavy feeding is beneficial.
