## 🌱 Overview
Ixia is a genus of cormous plants native to South Africa from the family Iridaceae. Some of them are known as the corn lily. Some distinctive traits include sword-like leaves and long wiry stems with star-shaped flowers. It usually prefers well-drained soil. The popular corn lily has specific, not very intense fragrance. It is often visited by many insects such as bees. The Ixia are also used sometimes as ornamental plants. The genus is endemic to the Cape Provinces of western South Africa.
The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek ἰξία (ixia) ( = χαμαιλέων λευκός, (chamaeleon leukos)), the pine thistle, Carlina gummifera, an unrelated plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Ixia, originating from the open Fynbos of South Africa, requires full sun and thrives with moderate watering during its winter-spring growing season. It's crucial to provide a dry dormancy period in summer. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, fertilize sparingly with a low-phosphorus blend.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; use a low-phosphorus formula sparingly, if at all.
