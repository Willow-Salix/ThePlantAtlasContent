## 🧤 Care Instructions
Merrill's Polyalthia thrives when provided with conditions similar to its native Philippine rainforest, emphasizing high humidity and consistent moisture. Ensure it receives dappled or partial shade, never full direct sun, and a regular feeding schedule during its active growth period for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, slow-release or liquid fertilizer applied moderately during the growing season (spring through summer), to support lush growth in nutrient-rich yet fast-draining tropical soils.
