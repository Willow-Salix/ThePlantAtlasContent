## 🧤 Care Instructions
Brewer's Rockcress thrives in conditions mimicking its native Californian montane habitat, preferring full sun, exceptionally well-drained and nutrient-poor soil. It is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, with care taken to avoid any waterlogging, especially during warm, dry periods.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, or serpentine soils. Fertilization is generally not required; if growth seems stunted, a very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
