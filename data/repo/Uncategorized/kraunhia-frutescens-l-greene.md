## 🧤 Care Instructions
American Wisteria thrives in full sun with consistently moist soil, mimicking its native habitat along stream banks in the Southeastern US. Provide moderate, balanced fertilization, ensuring it's not overly high in nitrogen to promote abundant flowering rather than just foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring. As a legume, it fixes some nitrogen, so avoid excessive nitrogen which can promote foliage over flowers.
