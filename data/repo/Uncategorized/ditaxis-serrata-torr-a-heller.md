## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires very little water, tolerating long periods of drought. Ensure excellent drainage and provide lean soil, as it is not accustomed to rich, constantly moist conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically requires minimal fertilization, perhaps a balanced, diluted fertilizer once a year in spring if grown in poor soil.
