## 🧤 Care Instructions
Seep Muhly is a resilient, low-maintenance grass that thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring only moderate watering during extended dry periods or active growth. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization to maintain its natural, compact form.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Native to lean, rocky, or average prairie soils, it does not require rich fertilization. Excessive fertilizer can lead to floppy growth.
