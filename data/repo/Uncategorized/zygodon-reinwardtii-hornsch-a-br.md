## 🧤 Care Instructions
Reinwardt's zygodon moss thrives in consistently humid, low-light environments, mimicking its native tropical montane cloud forest. Ensure continuous moisture without waterlogging and provide excellent air circulation to prevent rot. Fertilization is generally not required, focusing instead on maintaining high humidity and filtered light.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs and can be harmed by over-fertilization. If desired, use a highly diluted (e.g., 1/8 strength) liquid fertilizer very sparingly, perhaps once or twice a year.
