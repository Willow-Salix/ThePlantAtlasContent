## 🌱 Overview
A daylily, day lily or ditch-lily is a flowering plant in the genus Hemerocallis , a member of the family Asphodelaceae, subfamily Hemerocallidoideae, native to Asia. Despite the common name, it is not taxonomically classified in the lily genus. Gardening enthusiasts and horticulturists have long bred Hemerocallis species for their attractive flowers; a select few species of the genus have edible petals, while some are extremely toxic. Thousands of cultivars have been registered by the American Daylily Society, the only internationally recognized registrant according to the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants. The plants are perennial, bulbous plants, whose common name alludes to its flowers, which typically last about a day.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Amur Daylily thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring consistently moist, well-draining soil, similar to its native temperate meadows and forest edges. It requires regular watering during its active growth and flowering, along with moderate spring fertilization for optimal health. This hardy plant is quite adaptable, making it a robust choice for temperate garden landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization; benefits from a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring or the incorporation of organic matter into the soil.
