## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeast Asia, including countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and parts of China, Taiwan, and Northern Australia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | As epiphytes growing under dense canopy, Phalaenopsis require bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight, especially harsh midday sun, can scorch their leaves. |
| **💧 Water** | In their native humid environments with frequent rainfall, they prefer consistent moisture but excellent drainage. Water thoroughly when the growing medium is nearly dry, ensuring no standing water remains around the roots, and maintain high humidity. |

## 🌱 Overview
Phalaenopsis (), also known as moth orchids, is a genus of about seventy species of plants in the family Orchidaceae. Orchids in this genus are monopodial epiphytes or lithophytes with long, coarse roots, short, leafy stems and long-lasting, flat flowers arranged in a flowering stem that often branches near the end. Orchids in this genus are native to Asia, New Guinea, and Australia, but mostly occur in Indonesia and the Philippines.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Phalaenopsis thrive in bright, indirect light and require consistent moisture, allowing the medium to dry slightly between waterings, while ensuring high humidity. Utilize a well-draining orchid-specific medium and provide dilute fertilizer during periods of active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As epiphytes absorbing nutrients from rainwater and decaying organic matter, they require dilute, orchid-specific fertilizer applied regularly (e.g., every 2-4 weeks) during active growth, rather than heavy feeding.
