## 🌱 Overview
Zamia integrifolia, also known as coontie, is a small, tough, woody cycad native to the southeastern United States (in Florida and formerly in Georgia), the Bahamas, Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and Puerto Rico. It is the only cycad native to the continental United States (the parts of the USA that exclude Hawaii and Alaska). Traditionally, it was used by Indigenous Americans to make starch.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient cycad thrives in well-drained soil and bright indirect to partial sun. It is drought-tolerant and requires thorough watering only when the soil has completely dried out. Fertilize sparingly during its active growing season.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding during the growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced, slow-release or cycad-specific fertilizer. Over-fertilization can harm the plant.
