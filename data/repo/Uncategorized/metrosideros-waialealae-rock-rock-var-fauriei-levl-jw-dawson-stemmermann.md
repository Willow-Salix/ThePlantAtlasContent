## 🌱 Overview
Metrosideros (; MET-roe-SID-uh-ruhs) is a genus of approximately 60 trees, shrubs, and vines in the family Myrtaceae, mostly found in the Pacific region. Most of the tree forms are small, but some are exceptionally large, the New Zealand species in particular. The name derives from the Ancient Greek metra or "heartwood" and sideron or "iron". Perhaps the best-known species are the pōhutukawa (M. excelsa), northern rātā (M. robusta) and southern rātā (M. umbellata) of New Zealand, and ʻōhiʻa lehua (M. polymorpha) from the Hawaiian Islands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in high humidity and consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native Hawaiian montane bog environment. It prefers bright indirect light to partial sun and benefits from light to moderate fertilization during its growing season. Ensure constant moisture without waterlogging to emulate its naturally wet habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during active growth.
