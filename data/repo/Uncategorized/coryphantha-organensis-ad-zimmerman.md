## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives on neglect, requiring conditions that mimic its native arid environment. Provide abundant direct sunlight and ensure excellent drainage, watering only when the soil is thoroughly dry. Minimal fertilization is needed, primarily during its active growth phase, to support its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Fertilize once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer) with a diluted, balanced cactus-specific fertilizer.
