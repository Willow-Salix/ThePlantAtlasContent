## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including regions from British Columbia south to California, and east to the Dakotas and Nebraska. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily). It thrives in open, exposed locations. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate; highly drought-tolerant once established. Mimic its native conditions by watering deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Silky Lupine flourishes in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native temperate grasslands and shrublands. It is very drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it has low fertilizer needs and should not be over-fertilized with nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; as a legume, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. A light, balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer may be applied sparingly in very poor soils, but is often not necessary.
