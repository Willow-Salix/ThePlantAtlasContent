## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (New Mexico, West Texas, Arizona) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Chihuahuan Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to very bright indirect light, mimicking its exposed desert habitat where it receives direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, particularly crucial during its dormancy in winter. Overwatering will lead to root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sclerocactus ("hard cactus", from Greek; refers to the hard, dry fruit) is a genus of cacti.  It comprises about 15 species, the exact number depending on the authority. These species are xerophytic. They are sometimes called 'fishhook cactus' or 'little barrels.'

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions to prevent rot. Fertilize sparingly with a low-nitrogen formula during its brief growing period in spring and early summer. Ensure excellent drainage and protect from excessive moisture, especially in cooler temperatures.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization. Use a low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus/potassium cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring to early summer).
