## 🌱 Overview
Chaenactis is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae which are known generally as pincushions and dustymaidens.
These wildflowers are native to western North America, especially the desert southwest of the United States. They are quite variable in appearance. They are generally aster-like in appearance with many disc florets in each head. There may be only disc florets, but sometimes there are also enlarged ray florets along the edges of the corolla. They may be white to yellow or pink.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in harsh, sunny conditions typical of its native mountainous deserts. Provide it with full sun and extremely well-draining soil, as it is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering. Avoid over-fertilization, as it prefers lean soil conditions for robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky soils and does not require regular fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
