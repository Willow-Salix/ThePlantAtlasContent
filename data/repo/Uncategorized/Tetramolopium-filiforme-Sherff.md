## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (endemic to O'ahu, Kaua'i, Moloka'i) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Dry Shrubland / Exposed Ridgetop Habitat |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring direct sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily, consistent with its exposed ridgetop habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent but deep watering once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Excellent drainage is paramount to prevent root rot in its naturally well-drained environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Tetramolopium is a genus of plants in the tribe Astereae within the family Asteraceae.
Most of the species are native to New Guinea, 11 species are found in Hawaii, and one in the Cook Islands, with the island populations apparently representing a recent (by evolutionary standards) colonization.  It is related to Camptacra, Kippistia, Minuria, Peripleura, and Vittadinia all of which are from Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, or Pacific islands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian ridgetop endemic thrives in full sun and requires exceptional drainage to mimic its natural environment. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. Fertilization should be minimal, if any, due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements. If used, apply a very dilute, balanced slow-release fertilizer sparingly during the growing season, as native volcanic soils are often not overly rich.
