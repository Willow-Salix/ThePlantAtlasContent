## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical Asia (including India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, China, Taiwan), also parts of Africa and Oceania. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest / Subtropical Humid |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial Shade to Full Shade. Thrives in indirect light or dappled shade, avoiding direct, intense sunlight which can scorch its leaves. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly before re-watering. High humidity is beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Oldenlandia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is pantropical in distribution and has about 240 species. The type species for the genus is Oldenlandia corymbosa.
Oldenlandia was named by Linnaeus in 1753 in Species Plantarum. The name honors the Danish botanist Henrik Bernard Oldenland (c. 1663 – 1697). Some species are important in ethnomedicine; a number (usually island endemics) are threatened species, with one species and one variety being completely extinct already.
Some botanists have not recognized Oldenlandia, but have placed some or all of its species in a broadly defined Hedyotis. More recently, the circumscription of Hedyotis has been narrowed to a monophyletic group of about 115 species and no longer includes Oldenlandia. The genus Oldenlandia, as presently defined, is several times polyphyletic and will eventually be reduced to a group of species closely related to the type species. This group, known informally as Oldenlandia sensu stricto, is sister to a section of Kohautia that will eventually be separated from Kohautia and named as a new genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical understory plant prefers partial to full shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native forest floor environment. Provide high humidity and occasional light fertilization during its growing period to ensure healthy growth. Protect it from harsh, direct sunlight.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer (diluted to half strength) once every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). No fertilizer needed during dormancy.
