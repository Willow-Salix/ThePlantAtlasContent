## 🧤 Care Instructions
Alpine Milkvetch thrives in cool, exposed environments with excellent drainage and consistent soil moisture. Provide full sun to partial sun and avoid excessive fertilization, as it fixes its own nitrogen. Ensure well-drained soil to prevent root issues and emulate its native high-altitude habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring if soil is exceptionally poor, but often not necessary due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
