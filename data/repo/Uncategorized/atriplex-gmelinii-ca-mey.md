## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal areas of Eastern Siberia, Russian Far East, Mongolia, Korea, Japan, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Coastal Temperate to Subarctic Salt Marsh and Dune |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open coastal habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing for soil to dry slightly between waterings but preferring consistent moisture. It requires well-drained soil typical of sandy coastal areas and can tolerate some drought once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Atriplex () is a plant genus of about 250 species, known by the common names of saltbush and orache (; also spelled orach). It belongs to the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae s.l.. 
The genus is quite variable and widely distributed. It includes many desert and seashore plants and halophytes, as well as plants of moist environments. 
The generic name originated in Latin and was applied by Pliny the Elder to the edible oraches. The name saltbush derives from the fact that the plants retain salt in their leaves; they are able to grow in areas affected by soil salination.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gmelin's Saltbush thrives in full sun and well-drained, potentially saline soil, mirroring its native coastal habitat. It requires moderate watering, allowing for some drought tolerance once established, and has low fertilizer needs, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; this plant is adapted to the often nutrient-poor or specific mineral compositions of saline coastal soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
