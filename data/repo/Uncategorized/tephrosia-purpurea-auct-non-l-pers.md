## 🌱 Overview
Tephrosia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is widespread in both the Eastern and Western Hemisphere, where it is found in tropical and warm-temperate regions.
The generic name is derived from the Greek word τεφρος (tephros), meaning "ash-colored," referring to the greyish tint given to the leaves by their dense trichomes. Hoarypea is a common name for plants in this genus, along with goat's rue and devil's shoestring.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant prefers full sun exposure and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. It is well-adapted to drier conditions and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Overall, it requires minimal care once established in a warm, sunny environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive fertilization is not required. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season if soil is poor.
