## 🌱 Overview
Gentiana () is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the gentian family (Gentianaceae), the tribe Gentianeae, and the monophyletic subtribe Gentianinae. With over 300 species, it is considered a large genus. Gentians are notable for their mostly large trumpet-shaped flowers, which are often of an intense blue hue, though some are also bright yellow. The type species of the genus is Gentiana lutea.
The genus name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king who may have discovered tonic properties in gentians.

This plant requires full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its temperate woodland origins. Minimal fertilization is needed, making it a relatively low-maintenance perennial once established in its preferred conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is usually sufficient, as it typically grows in moderately fertile forest and meadow soils.
