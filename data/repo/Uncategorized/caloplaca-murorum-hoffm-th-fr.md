## 🌱 Overview
Caloplaca is a lichen genus comprising a number of distinct species. Members of the genus are commonly called firedot lichen, jewel lichen. gold lichens, "orange lichens", but they are not always orange, as in the case of C. albovariegata. The distribution of this lichen genus is worldwide, extending from Antarctica to the high Arctic. It includes a portion of northern North America and the Russian High Arctic. There are about thirty species of Caloplaca in the flora of the British Isles.
A new species of Caloplaca, C. obamae, the first species to be named in honor of Barack Obama, was discovered in 2007 on Santa Rosa Island in California and published in March 2009.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen requires bright, direct sunlight and a suitable inorganic substrate like rock or concrete to thrive. It tolerates long dry periods, absorbing moisture passively from the atmosphere. No traditional watering or fertilization is necessary, as it obtains nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Caloplaca murorum obtains all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere and the substrate itself, and is sensitive to conventional fertilizers.
