## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic regions, specifically parts of Arctic Russia (e.g., Arctic Urals, Novaya Zemlya, Yamal Peninsula) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic Tundra / Polar Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires high levels of direct sun exposure, characteristic of treeless arctic environments during the growing season. Can tolerate long daylight hours with low sun angles. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist to wet soil conditions, typical of tundra environments with melting snow and permafrost close to the surface. Avoid complete drying out but ensure moderate drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
×  Pucciphippsia is a nothogenus of Arctic plants in the grass family, reported from Greenland, Svalbard, and Magadan. The nothogenus is derived from a hybridization between Phippsia and Puccinellia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arctic grass thrives in cold, treeless environments with high sun exposure during its short growing season. It requires consistently moist soil conditions, mimicking the melting snow and ice of its native tundra, and has very low nutrient demands due to its adaptation to poor soils. Ensure cold temperatures and good moisture for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Native soils are nutrient-poor; excessive fertilization is likely harmful and unnecessary. A lean substrate is preferred.
