## Care Guide
Gray's Anemone flourishes in cool, shaded environments with consistently moist, well-draining soil rich in organic matter. Protect it from direct, intense sunlight, and ensure regular watering during its active growth. Provide an annual feeding with compost or a balanced fertilizer in spring.

### Fertilizer
