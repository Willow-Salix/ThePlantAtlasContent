## Care Guide
Spiny Cocklebur thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native open grasslands. It requires moderate, consistent watering and is not particularly demanding regarding soil fertility. This plant generally prefers disturbed sites and can be quite resilient.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; can grow in average to poor soils, but will benefit from a balanced fertilizer application during its active growth phase if soils are very nutrient-deficient.
