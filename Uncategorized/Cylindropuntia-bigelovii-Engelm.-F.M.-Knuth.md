## Care Guide
To thrive, the Teddy Bear Cholla requires maximum direct sunlight and extremely infrequent watering, mimicking its harsh desert origins. It is highly drought-tolerant and benefits from well-draining soil with very minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; a diluted, low-nitrogen fertilizer can be applied during its active growing season (spring/summer), or often none is needed.
