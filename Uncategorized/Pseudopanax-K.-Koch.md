## Care Guide
Pseudopanax thrives in conditions similar to its native New Zealand temperate forests, preferring consistent moisture and bright, indirect light. Ensure well-draining soil and provide moderate fertilization during its growth period to maintain its health and vibrant foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer), reducing in fall and winter.
