# Endococcus buelliae
### *Endococcus buelliae (C.W. Dodge) Matzer*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in temperate regions where its host lichens, such as saxicolous (rock-dwelling) Buellia species, occur on exposed surfaces. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Saxicolous Habitats |
| **☀️ Light** | High light exposure, mimicking the conditions where its host lichens thrive on open, well-lit rock surfaces. |
| **💧 Water** | Intermittent wetting and drying, entirely dependent on natural rainfall, dew, and atmospheric moisture that rehydrates the host lichen. |

## 🌱 Overview
Endococcus is a genus of lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) in the family Lichenotheliaceae. It has 44 species. The genus was circumscribed by the Finnish botanist William Nylander in 1855. Although at least one source places the genus in the Verrucariaceae, a 2016 study of the type species, Endococcus rugulosus, determined that it should instead be placed in the family Lichenotheliaceae of the order Dothideales; this classification echoes a placement proposed in 1979 by David Hawksworth.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a lichenicolous fungus, Endococcus buelliae's survival is contingent upon the flourishing of its specific host lichen, typically certain Buellia species. This requires an environment with high light exposure on stable rock substrates and natural, intermittent moisture from precipitation, as the fungus obtains all nutrients from its host.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; Endococcus buelliae is a lichenicolous fungus that derives all necessary nutrients directly from its host lichen, negating the need for traditional fertilization.
