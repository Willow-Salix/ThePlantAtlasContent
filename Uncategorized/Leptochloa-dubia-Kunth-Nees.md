## 🧤 Care Instructions
This warm-season grass thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Provide deep, infrequent watering and avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to drier, less nutrient-rich conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to leaner soils found in natural grasslands, requiring minimal supplemental nutrients.
