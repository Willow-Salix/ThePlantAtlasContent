## Introduction
Leptochloa is a widespread genus of Asian, Australian, and American plants in the grass family.
Members of the genus are commonly known as sprangletops.
The generic name is derived from the Greek words leptos, meaning "thin," and chloa, meaning "grass," referring to the inflorescences.

## Care Guide
This warm-season grass thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Provide deep, infrequent watering and avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to drier, less nutrient-rich conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to leaner soils found in natural grasslands, requiring minimal supplemental nutrients.
