## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus demands full, direct sunlight and extremely well-draining soil. Water sparingly, allowing the substrate to dry entirely between applications, especially reducing water in cooler months. Fertilize very lightly with a low-nitrogen formula during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer needed. Use a low-nitrogen, high-potassium fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring to early summer), reflecting the lean desert soils.
