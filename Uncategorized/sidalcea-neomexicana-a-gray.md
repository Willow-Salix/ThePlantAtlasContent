## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western and Central United States (e.g., New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, California, Oregon) and Northern Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Wetland Edges, typically in moist to wet areas like meadows, stream banks, and seeps, often with alkaline or saline soils. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in open, exposed locations with ample light. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist to wet soil, especially during the active growing season. Tolerant of brief dry periods once established but performs best with regular and ample moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).
