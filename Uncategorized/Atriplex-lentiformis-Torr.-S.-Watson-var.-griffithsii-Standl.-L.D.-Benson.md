## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California) and Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert (Sonoran and Mojave Deserts) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires high light intensity and direct sun exposure for optimal growth, typical of desert environments. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; extremely drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Needs minimal water once established, mimicking desert rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Atriplex () is a plant genus of about 250 species, known by the common names of saltbush and orache (; also spelled orach). It belongs to the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae s.l.. 
The genus is quite variable and widely distributed. It includes many desert and seashore plants and halophytes, as well as plants of moist environments. 
The generic name originated in Latin and was applied by Pliny the Elder to the edible oraches. The name saltbush derives from the fact that the plants retain salt in their leaves; they are able to grow in areas affected by soil salination.

## Care Guide
Griffiths' Saltbush is a robust, drought-tolerant plant thriving in full sun, characteristic of its native arid desert habitats. It requires very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely, and has minimal to no fertilizer needs, adapting well to poor, saline soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to nutrient-poor, often saline or alkaline soils. Fertilizing is generally not necessary and can be detrimental.
