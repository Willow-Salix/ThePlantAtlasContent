## Care Guide
The False Beech Fern thrives in environments that replicate its native tropical rainforest understory, requiring consistent moisture, high humidity, and protection from direct sunlight. Ensure well-draining soil and provide a light, balanced fertilizer during active growth to maintain lush fronds.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer (half strength) once a month during the growing season (spring/summer). Avoid over-fertilizing.
