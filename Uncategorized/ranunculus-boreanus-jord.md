## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern parts of Eurasia and North America, including regions such as Canada, Alaska, Scandinavia, and Siberia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subarctic and Boreal Forest/Tundra climate, characterized by long, cold winters, short cool summers, and often moist or boggy conditions. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, especially during the short but intense northern growing season. It thrives with ample light when actively growing. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil. This plant does not tolerate drought and thrives in boggy or perpetually damp environments, mimicking its native habitat with snowmelt and frequent rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ranunculus  is a large genus of about 1750 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Members of the genus are known as buttercups, spearworts and water crowfoots.
The genus is distributed worldwide, primarily in temperate and montane regions. The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, which has extremely tough and tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much taller meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris. In ornamental  gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.
Buttercups usually flower in the spring, but flowers may be found throughout the summer, especially where the plants are growing as opportunistic colonizers, as in the case of garden weeds.
The water crowfoots (Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium), which grow in still or running water, are sometimes treated in a separate genus Batrachium (from Greek βάτραχος bátrakhos, "frog"). They have two different leaf types, thread-like leaves underwater and broader floating leaves. In some species, such as R. aquatilis, a third, intermediate leaf type occurs.
Ranunculus species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Hebrew character and small angle shades. Some species are popular ornamental flowers in horticulture, with many cultivars selected for large and brightly coloured flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Northern Buttercup thrives in cool, consistently moist conditions mirroring its subarctic origins. Provide ample light, ranging from full sun to partial shade, during its active summer growth. Keep the soil perpetually damp, and fertilize very sparingly as it is adapted to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, often acidic soils. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer or annual addition of organic matter is sufficient, avoiding over-fertilization.
