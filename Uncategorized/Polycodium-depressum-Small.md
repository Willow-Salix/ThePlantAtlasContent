## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, from southern Maine to Georgia and Alabama, west to Missouri and Arkansas, particularly common in the Appalachian Mountains. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full sun, preferring more sun for optimal fruiting. |
| **Watering** | Moderate, allowing the top soil to dry slightly between waterings; avoid prolonged wet conditions as it thrives in well-drained, often dryish soils. |

## Introduction
Blueberries are a widely distributed and widespread group of perennial flowering plants with blue or purple berries. They are classified in the section Cyanococcus within the genus Vaccinium. Commercial blueberries—both wild (lowbush) and cultivated (highbush)—are all native to North America. The highbush varieties were introduced into Europe during the 1930s.
Blueberries are usually prostrate shrubs that can vary in size from 10 centimeters (4 inches) to 4 meters (13 feet) in height. In the commercial production of blueberries, the species with small, pea-size berries growing on low-level bushes is known as "lowbush blueberries" (synonymous with "wild"), while the species with larger berries growing on taller, cultivated bushes is known as "highbush blueberries". Canada is the leading producer of lowbush blueberries, while the United States produces some 29% of the world's supply of highbush blueberries.

## Care Guide
This low-maintenance plant thrives in acidic, well-draining soil with partial to full sun exposure. It prefers consistent moisture but tolerates drier conditions, so water moderately and avoid waterlogging. Fertilize sparingly in spring with an acid-specific formula to encourage healthy growth and fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Minimal, as it is adapted to poor, acidic soils. If needed, use an acidic fertilizer specifically formulated for blueberries or acid-loving plants, applied sparingly in early spring.
