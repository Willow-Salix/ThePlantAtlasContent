## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Southern Europe (where its parent species are native and where the hybrid often naturalizes) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Dryland/Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry conditions and well-drained soils in its native range. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Verbascum is a genus of over 450 species of flowering plants, common name mullein (), in the figwort family Scrophulariaceae. They are native to Europe and Asia, with the highest species diversity in the Mediterranean.
Mullein or "mullein leaf" often refers to the leaves of Verbascum thapsus, the great or common mullein, which is frequently used in herbal medicine.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid mullein thrives in full sun and well-drained, even poor, soil, reflecting its native temperate dryland habitats. It requires minimal watering once established and generally needs very little, if any, supplemental fertilizer. This makes it a very low-maintenance plant suitable for sunny, drier locations.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-drained soils, consistent with its typical growth in disturbed or uncultivated areas in its native environment. Avoid over-fertilization.
