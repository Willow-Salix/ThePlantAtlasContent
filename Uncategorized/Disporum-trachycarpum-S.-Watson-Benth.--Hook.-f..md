## Care Guide
This woodland plant thrives in part to full shade, requiring consistently moist, well-drained soil that is rich in organic matter. Provide regular watering to maintain soil moisture and a moderate feeding in spring to support healthy growth, mimicking its native temperate forest environment.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from soil enriched with organic matter like compost, or a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied in spring to support its growth in richer forest floor conditions.
