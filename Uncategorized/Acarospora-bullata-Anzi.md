## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in arid to semi-arid and Mediterranean regions of temperate zones (e.g., Western North America, parts of Europe) |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure, direct sunlight. Thrives in open, exposed environments. |

## Introduction
Acarospora is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Acarosporaceae. Most species in the genus are crustose lichens that grow on rocks in open and arid places all over the world. They may look like a cobblestone road or cracked up old paint, and are commonly called cobblestone lichens or cracked lichens. They usually grow on rock (are "saxicolous"), but some grow on soil (terricolous) or on other lichens. Some species in the genus are fungi that live as parasites on other lichens (lichenicolous fungi). Acarospora is a widely distributed genus, with about 128 species according to a 2008 estimate.
Species in Acarospora may be shiny as if covered with a glossy varnish, or dull and powdery looking. They have a diverse range of colors, from the brilliant yellow bright cobblestone lichen, to the dark reddish-brown mountain cobblestone lichen, or they can appear tan, gray, or white, from a dusty-looking coating (pruina). They may grow in crustose forms like a warty surface (verrucose), like cracking-up old crust of paint (rimose), like a bunch of "islands" in a dry lake bed (areolate), like the flakes of cracking up paint are peeling up at the edges (sub-squamulous), or like the flakes are growing over others like scales (squamulous).

## Care Guide
This crustose lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its arid to semi-arid native environment, requiring high sun exposure and very infrequent moisture. It is adapted to long dry periods and absorbs nutrients from the atmosphere and rock, needing no supplemental fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. Obtains necessary trace nutrients from the air, dust, and rock substrate.
