## Introduction
Stipa is a genus of about 140 species of large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and  spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to Stipa, which have since been reclassified into new genera.
Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as Stipa brachytricha, S. arundinacea, S. splendens, S. gigantea and S. pulchra are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.
It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.

## Care Guide
This hardy perennial thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native montane grassland habitat. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, preferring drier conditions between waterings. Fertilizer is generally not needed.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically not required in most garden soils. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring if growth is poor.
