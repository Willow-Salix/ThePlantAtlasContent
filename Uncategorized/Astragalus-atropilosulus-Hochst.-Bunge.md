## Care Guide
This hardy legume thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native arid montane habitat. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization to ensure optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year in spring, or not at all in poor but well-draining soils.
