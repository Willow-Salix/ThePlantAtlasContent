## Care Guide
Kirilow's Indigo thrives in temperate woodlands and scrublands, requiring full sun to partial shade for optimal growth and flowering. It prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil but can tolerate some drought once established. As a legume, it needs minimal fertilizer, especially avoiding high-nitrogen formulas.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth is poor.
