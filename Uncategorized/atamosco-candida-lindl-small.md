## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in full sun and well-drained, consistently moist soil, the White Rain Lily requires regular watering, especially during its active growth period. Mimicking its grassland origins, it benefits from moderate fertilization to encourage robust flowering after periods of rain.
