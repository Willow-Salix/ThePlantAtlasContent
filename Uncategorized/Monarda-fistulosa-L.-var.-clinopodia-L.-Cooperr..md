## Introduction
Monarda is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. The genus is endemic to North America. Common names include bergamot, bee balm, horsemint, and oswego tea, the first being inspired by the fragrance of the leaves, which is reminiscent of bergamot orange (Citrus bergamia). The genus was named for the Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes, who wrote a book in 1574 describing plants of the New World.

## Care Guide
Basil Bee Balm thrives in temperate moist woodlands and forest edges of Eastern North America, preferring partial sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. It requires regular watering and has low fertilizer needs, making it a relatively easy-care plant for woodland gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in average to moderately rich, organic-heavy woodland soils. Excessive fertilization can promote lush foliage at the expense of flowers.
