## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (including regions of Eastern Canada and the Northeastern United States, particularly the Appalachian Mountains) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (cool, moist, often acidic forest floors) |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to deep shade. Must be protected from direct sunlight, which can scorch and dry it out. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and consistently moist conditions. Requires frequent watering or misting to keep the substrate damp but not waterlogged. Does not tolerate drying out. |

## Introduction
Pogonatum is a genus of mosses — commonly called spike moss — which contains approximately 70 species that cover a cosmopolitan distribution. It can be seen mostly in Asian countries with a tropical climate.

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, highly humid, and shaded environments, mimicking its native temperate forest floor. It requires consistently moist soil or substrate and protection from direct sunlight to prevent desiccation. Nutrient requirements are minimal, making fertilization largely unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses are not heavy feeders and can be harmed by excessive nutrients. No fertilizer is typically needed, or a very dilute, infrequent application if growth is exceptionally poor.
