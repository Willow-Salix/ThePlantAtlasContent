## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions similar to its native semiarid grasslands, requiring full sun and excellent drainage. It is very drought-tolerant, needing infrequent but deep watering once established. Minimal fertilization is necessary for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs; thrives in lean, well-draining soils. A light, balanced fertilizer once in spring may be beneficial, but is often not strictly necessary.
