## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Dry Shrubland / Coastal Lowland Dry Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its exposed native habitat on lava flows. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, deep watering; allow the soil to thoroughly dry out between waterings, as it is adapted to periods of drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Centaurium (centaury) is a genus of 20 species in the gentian family (Gentianaceae), tribe Chironieae, subtribe Chironiinae. The genus was named after the centaur Chiron, famed in Greek mythology for his skill in medicinal herbs. It is distributed across Europe and Asia.
Until 2004, Centaurium was given a much wider circumscription, comprising about 50 species ranging across Europe, Asia, the Americas, Australasia, and the Pacific. However this circumscription was polyphyletic, so in 2004 the genus was split into four, being Centaurium sensu stricto, Zeltnera, Gyrandra, and Schenkia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Lavaslope Centaury thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, tolerating dry conditions well. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings, and use fertilizer very lightly or not at all for best results.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; this plant generally does not require heavy fertilization. A very light application of a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer once during the active growing season is sufficient, or none if the soil is naturally fertile.
