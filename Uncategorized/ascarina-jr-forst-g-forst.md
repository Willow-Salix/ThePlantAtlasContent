## 🌱 Overview
Ascarina is an ancient, woody, angiosperm genus. It is a distinct genus of the family Chloranthaceae, consisting of less than twenty species, found in the Australian region, the Pacific Islands and Madagascar. They can grow up to six metres tall and have a spread of approximately three metres. Ascarina are usually tropical cloud forest species which need high humidity to thrive, and are vulnerable to both frost and drought. There has been discussion and research on whether or not this genus and its family are primitive, or have become reduced over time. Another controversial topic for the genus is its relation to the Clavatipollenites, a fossilized pollen.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ascarina thrives in conditions that mimic its native tropical and subtropical rainforests. Provide partial shade, consistently moist but well-draining soil, and high humidity. Light fertilization during the growing season will support healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from light fertilization with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease feeding in colder months.
