# Laurel-leaf Banisteria

*Banisteria laurifolia L.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical Americas, including the Caribbean |
| **Climate** | Tropical Seasonal Forest and Subtropical Thicket |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, ideally receiving at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight daily for robust growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out completely between waterings. It tolerates brief dry periods but thrives with consistent moisture during its active growing season. |

## Care Guide
This adaptable tropical plant prefers ample sunlight and moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions. Fertilize lightly during its active growth period to encourage vibrant foliage and potential flowering, mimicking the nutrient availability in its native environment.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler, dormant periods.
