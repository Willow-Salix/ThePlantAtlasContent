## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, particularly the southeastern United States, extending northwards. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Wetland (Bogs, Fens, Swamps, Wet Depressions) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Can tolerate some direct sun if kept consistently wet and cool. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant saturation with water and very high humidity (above 70-80%). Water with distilled water, rainwater, or deionized water to maintain low mineral content and acidity. Never allow to dry out. |

## Introduction
Sphagnum is a genus of approximately 380 accepted species of mosses, commonly known as sphagnum moss, also bog moss and quacker moss (although that term is also sometimes used for peat). Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16 to 26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions.
As Sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. Thus, Sphagnum can influence the composition of such habitats, with some describing Sphagnum as 'habitat manipulators' or 'autogenic ecosystem engineers'. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants.
Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions.
Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, and any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.

## Care Guide
Lescur's sphagnum thrives in consistently saturated, acidic, and nutrient-poor conditions, mirroring its native bog environment. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade, ensuring very high humidity and constant moisture using only distilled water or rainwater. Avoid all fertilization as it is highly sensitive to mineral nutrients.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Sphagnum mosses are adapted to nutrient-poor environments and are highly sensitive to mineral salts; fertilization can be detrimental.
