## Introduction
Bletilla, common name urn orchid, is a temperate, terrestrial genus of orchids containing five currently recognized species distributed through China, Japan, Taiwan, south to Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar. The name is actually a diminutive of Bletia because of the resemblance between the two genera even though Bletia is a New World genus. The genera Jimensia Raf. and Polytoma Lour. ex Gomes are generally included into Bletilla. This genus is abbreviated Ble in trade journals.
The pseudobulbs resemble spreading corms which usually sit at ground level. Each pseudobulb generally bears several pleated leaves around 40 cm (16 in) long. The racemes of flowers emerge from the center of the years new growth before it is mature, during spring and early summer. The flowers vary in color from white to purple, and all species have four pollinia.
The tubers resemble a horn or claw. They are grayish-white or yellowish-white in appearance, with concentric rings and brown rootlets. They have a hard texture and do not break easily.

## Care Guide
Bletilla orchids flourish in temperate to subtropical climates, preferring partial shade and consistently moist soil when actively growing. They benefit from moderate fertilization during this period. Ensure a dry dormancy over winter to promote reblooming.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding; use a balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season.
