## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native thrives in environments mimicking its subtropical mesic forest home, preferring bright, indirect light or partial sun. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to partially dry between sessions. Fertilize sparingly during active growth to support its needs.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the active growing season. Use a balanced, slow-release formula or incorporate organic matter into the soil.
