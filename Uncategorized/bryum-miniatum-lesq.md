| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane Riparian |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to indirect light. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can scorch and dry out the moss. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in a constantly moist, high-humidity environment with partial shade to indirect light, mimicking its native habitat along temperate mountain streams. Consistent watering is paramount, with very little to no fertilizer needed for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses obtain most nutrients from water and their environment. If desired, apply a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly, perhaps once a year.
