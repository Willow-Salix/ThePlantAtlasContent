## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, specifically the eastern United States from Massachusetts south to Florida and west to Missouri. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest and Meadowland (characterized by distinct seasons, moderate rainfall, and well-drained soils). |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. It thrives in locations with direct morning sun and some afternoon shade, or dappled light throughout the day, mimicking its open woodland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained, especially during the growing season. Avoid waterlogging, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly between waterings, reflecting its native environment's moderate rainfall. |

## Introduction
Gentiana () is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the gentian family (Gentianaceae), the tribe Gentianeae, and the monophyletic subtribe Gentianinae. With over 300 species, it is considered a large genus. Gentians are notable for their mostly large trumpet-shaped flowers, which are often of an intense blue hue, though some are also bright yellow. The type species of the genus is Gentiana lutea.
The genus name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king who may have discovered tonic properties in gentians.

## Care Guide
This plant requires full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its temperate woodland origins. Minimal fertilization is needed, making it a relatively low-maintenance perennial once established in its preferred conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is usually sufficient, as it typically grows in moderately fertile forest and meadow soils.
