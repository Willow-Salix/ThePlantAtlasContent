## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
The Aboriginal Hawthorn thrives in temperate woodland conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate, consistent watering to mimic its native rainfall patterns, especially when young or during droughts, but tolerates average, well-drained soils without heavy fertilization. Provide adequate sun for optimal health and fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial, particularly in poor soils, but generally not a heavy feeder.
