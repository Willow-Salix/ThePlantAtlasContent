## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently wet soil, reflecting its native wetland habitat. Avoid letting the soil dry out and use fertilizer sparingly, as it is adapted to low-nutrient conditions.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization, if any, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, boggy soils. Excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
