## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central Texas, USA (Edwards Plateau region) |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Grassland/Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), consistent with its open grassland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and deep watering. Allow soil to dry completely between waterings, as it is adapted to periods of drought in its native semi-arid environment. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Phacelia (phacelia, scorpionweed, heliotrope) is a genus of about 200 species of annual or perennial herbaceous plants in the borage family, native to North and South America. California is particularly rich in species with over 90 recorded in the region.
The genus is traditionally placed at family rank with the waterleafs (Hydrophyllaceae) in the order Boraginales. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, recognizing that the traditional Boraginaceae and Hydrophyllaceae are paraphyletic with respect to each other, merges the latter into the former and considers the family basal in the Euasterids I clade. Other botanists continue to recognize the Hydrophyllaceae and Boraginales after analysing the secondary structure of the ITS1 genetic region rather than its sequence for these higher taxonomic levels.  This placed Phacelia within the Hydrophyllaceae. Further molecular taxonomic analysis of the Boraginales has divided the Boraginales in two and placed Phacelia among the monophyletic herbaceous Hydrophyllaceae in Boraginales II.
The genus includes both annual and perennial species. Many have been cultivated as garden and honey plants.
There are reports that glandular hairs of stems, flowers and leaves of some species of Phacelia secrete oil droplets that can cause an unpleasant skin rash (contact dermatitis) in some people, specifically from P. brachyloba, P. campanularia, P. crenulata, P. gina-glenneae, P. grandiflora, P. ixodes, P. minor, and P. pedicellata. The major contact allergen of P. crenulata has been identified as geranylhydroquinone and of P. minor as geranylgeranylhydroquinone.
The mining bee Andrena phaceliae is a specialist pollinator of this genus in the Eastern United States.

## Care Guide
Lundell's Phacelia is a drought-tolerant annual native to the semi-arid grasslands of Central Texas, requiring full sun exposure and very well-drained soil. It thrives with infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly, and needs minimal to no fertilizer due to its adaptation to lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. This plant thrives in lean, rocky, or sandy soils typical of its native habitat and generally does not require supplemental fertilization.
