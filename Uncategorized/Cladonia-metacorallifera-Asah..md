## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Boreal and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America (Alaska, Canada), Europe (Scandinavia, Russia), and Asia (Japan). |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate and Boreal Forests, Tundra, and Open Woodlands. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. Avoid intense, prolonged direct afternoon sunlight which can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and regular moisture. Misting or exposure to rain/dew is essential. Can rehydrate after drying but needs consistent access to moisture. |

## Introduction
Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations.
Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).
Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.
Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dunes, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.
Larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes continuella, feed on Cladonia species.

## Care Guide
This cup lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Maintaining high atmospheric moisture through misting or natural humidity is vital, as it absorbs water directly from the air. Avoid all commercial fertilizers, as they can harm this nutrient-sensitive organism.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens are sensitive to external nutrients and thrive in nutrient-poor environments; conventional fertilizers can be detrimental.
