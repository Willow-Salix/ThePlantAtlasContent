## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (from New York south to Mississippi and Georgia) |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate Forest, specifically thriving in disturbed sites within this biome. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it's a pioneer species that does not tolerate shade well. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering when young to establish; once mature, it is quite drought-tolerant and needs minimal supplemental water, especially in well-drained soils. |

## Introduction
Pinus virginiana, the Virginia pine, scrub pine, Jersey pine, possum pine, is a medium-sized tree, often found on poorer soils from Long Island in southern New York south through the Appalachian Mountains to western Tennessee and Alabama. The usual size range for this pine is 5.5 to 18 metres. However, it can grow larger under optimum conditions. The trunk can be as large as 20 inches in diameter. This tree prefers a well-drained loam or clay, but will also grow on substandard, sandy soil, where it remains small and stunted. The typical life span is 65 to 90 years.
The short (4–8 cm), yellow-green needles are paired in fascicles and are often twisted. Pinecones are 4–7 cm long and may persist on the tree for many years, often (though not always) releasing their seeds in the second year. In growth habit, some trees may be inclined with twisted trunks.
This pine is useful for reforesting and provides nourishment for wildlife. Its other main use is on Christmas tree farms, despite having sharp-tipped needles and yellowish winter color. It can also provide wood pulp and lumber. Like some other southern yellow pines, Virginia pine lumber case hardens. That is, it becomes very hard over time during wood drying. Wood from Virginia pine is not normally considered to resist rot unless treated with preservatives.

## Care Guide
Virginia Pine is a hardy, full-sun species adapted to the humid temperate forests of the southeastern U.S. It prefers poor, acidic soils and requires minimal fertilization. Once established, it is very drought-tolerant, making it a low-maintenance choice for suitable climates.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; it thrives in poor, acidic soils and typically does not require fertilization. Over-fertilization can be harmful.
