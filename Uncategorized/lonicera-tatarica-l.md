## 🌱 Overview
Honeysuckles are arching shrubs or twining vines in the genus Lonicera () of the family Caprifoliaceae. The genus includes 158 species native to northern latitudes in North America, Eurasia, and North Africa. Widely known species include Lonicera periclymenum (common honeysuckle or woodbine), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle, white honeysuckle, or Chinese honeysuckle) and Lonicera sempervirens (coral honeysuckle, trumpet honeysuckle, or woodbine honeysuckle). L. japonica is a highly invasive species considered a significant pest in parts of North America, Europe, South America, New Zealand, Australia, and Africa.
Some species are highly fragrant and colorful, so are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. In North America, hummingbirds are attracted to the flowers, especially L. sempervirens and L. ciliosa (orange honeysuckle). Honeysuckle derives its name from the edible sweet nectar obtainable from its tubular flowers. The name Lonicera stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tatarian honeysuckle, native to temperate shrublands, thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moderate, consistent moisture, though it becomes drought-tolerant once established. It is adaptable to average soil conditions and requires minimal fertilization. This hardy shrub is generally low-maintenance, reflecting its robust nature in its native environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal. Growing in temperate shrublands and woodlands, the plant is adapted to soils with varying fertility, often enriched by natural organic matter. Fertilization is generally not essential unless soil is exceptionally poor; a light, balanced fertilizer in spring suffices if needed.
