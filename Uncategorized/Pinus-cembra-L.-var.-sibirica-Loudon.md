## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Siberia (Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan) |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest (Taiga) and Subalpine/Alpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, high-altitude native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil; water regularly during dry periods, avoiding waterlogging due to ample precipitation in its native range but adapted to well-drained sites. |

## Introduction
Pinus sibirica, or Siberian pine, in the family Pinaceae is a species of pine tree that occurs in Siberia from 58°E in the Ural Mountains east to 126°E in the Stanovoy Range in southern Sakha Republic, and from Igarka at 68°N in the lower Yenisei valley, south to 45°N in central Mongolia.

## Care Guide
This cold-hardy pine thrives in full sun and well-drained, consistently moist soil, typical of its native Siberian boreal forests. It prefers cooler climates and does not require heavy fertilization, benefiting most from conditions that mimic its high-altitude, open habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring if soil is poor, as native boreal soils are not excessively rich.
