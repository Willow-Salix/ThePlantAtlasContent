## Care Guide
This Caribbean native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, exhibiting strong drought tolerance due to its dry forest origins. Provide moderate water during warm months and minimal water otherwise, complementing with light fertilization during its growth phase.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring/summer). Avoid over-fertilizing, as it is adapted to less nutrient-rich soils.
