## Introduction
Gypsophila () is a genus of flowering plants in the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae. They are native to Eurasia, Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Turkey has a particularly high diversity of Gypsophila taxa, with about 35 endemic species. Some Gypsophila are introduced species in other regions.
The genus name is from the Greek gypsos ("gypsum") and philios ("loving"), a reference to the gypsum-rich substrates on which some species grow. Plants of the genus are known commonly as baby's-breath, or bebe's breath, a name which also refers specifically to the well known ornamental species Gypsophila paniculata.

## Care Guide
Perfoliate baby's-breath thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native steppe habitat. It requires infrequent watering due to its drought tolerance, and minimal fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization needs. It thrives in average, well-drained, often alkaline to neutral soils, and usually benefits from a single application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in early spring.
