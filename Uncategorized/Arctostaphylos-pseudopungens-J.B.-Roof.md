## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically California (where this hybrid cultivar was developed, drawing from species native to Southwestern US and Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (6+ hours direct sun daily) is ideal, tolerates some light afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and deep watering, especially during dry periods. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal to no supplemental water. |

## Introduction
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## Care Guide
This exceptionally tough and low-maintenance plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal to no fertilizer, making it ideal for xeriscaping in Mediterranean climates.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer requirements. Over-fertilization, especially with high phosphorus, can be detrimental. If needed, a very light application of a low-nitrogen, slow-release fertilizer in early spring.
