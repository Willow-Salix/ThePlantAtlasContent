## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains, Pacific Northwest, Alaska, parts of Canada) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Subalpine Rocky Slopes |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright light, often in open alpine environments, but can benefit from some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist during the growing season (spring to late summer), ensuring excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Reduce watering significantly in winter or during dormancy. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in bright light and cool conditions with consistently moist, well-draining, gritty soil. Avoid waterlogging, especially in winter, and provide minimal fertilization to mimic its natural, nutrient-poor rocky habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring is generally sufficient, or none if planted in rich enough soil.
