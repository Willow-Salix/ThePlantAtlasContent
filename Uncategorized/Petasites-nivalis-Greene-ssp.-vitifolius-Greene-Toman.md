## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (Alaska, Canada, northern United States) |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest and Subalpine Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Shade to Full Sun (prefers partial shade in warmer climates to maintain cool, moist conditions) |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist to wet; requires high humidity and does not tolerate drying out, mimicking its native boggy habitats. |

## Introduction
Petasites frigidus, the Arctic sweet coltsfoot or Arctic butterbur, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Arctic to cool temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in northern Europe, northern Asia and northern North America.
It is a herbaceous perennial plant producing flowering stems in early spring, and large leaves through the summer. The upright flowering stems are 10–20 cm (4–8 in) tall, and bear only 5–12 inflorescences, yellowish-white to pink in colour. The leaves are rounded, 15–20 cm (6–8 in) broad, with a deeply cleft base and shallowly lobed margin, and rise directly from the underground rootstock. The underside of the leaves is covered with matted, woolly fuzz. It grows in moist shaded ground, preferring stream banks and seeping ground of cut-banks.

While there is some disagreement, some sources identify five varieties of P. frigidus:

Petasites frigidus var. frigidus
Petasites frigidus var. nivalis, sometimes referred to as P. nivalis or P. hyperboreus. This variety is common at subalpine and alpine elevations.
Petasites frigidus var. palmatus, sometimes referred to as P. palmatus, palmate coltsfoot, or western coltsfoot; mâl-ē-mē’ (Konkow language); or tä-tä-tē’; pē’-wē is the root.
Petasites frigidus var. sagittatus, arrowleaf sweet coltsfoot.
Petasites frigidus var. vitifolius

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, moist, and humid environments, preferring consistently wet soil conditions reminiscent of its native bogs and stream banks. Provide partial shade to full sun in cooler climates, ensuring the soil never dries out. It benefits from light to moderate organic fertilization during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with organic matter, especially during the active growing season, reflecting the nutrient cycling in wetland soils.
