## Introduction
Acleisanthes is a genus of flowering plants in the Bougainvillea family, Nyctaginaceae. There are currently 16 species. The generic name is derived from the Greek words ακλειοτος (akleistos), meaning "not closed", and ανθος (anthos), meaning "flower". Plants of this genus are known commonly as trumpets due to the elongated, open-ended shape of their flowers. These are arid-adapted perennials with thick taproots which are usually compact and low to the ground or slightly ascending. An individual plant may have cleistogamous (unopening and self-pollinating) flowers as well as opening flowers which are usually nocturnal as a water-saving adaptation and are pollinated by night-flying or crepuscular insects such as hawkmoths. Flowers are usually white, sometimes yellow. These plants are native to the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts of Mexico and the United States.

## Care Guide
The Gypsum Moonpod thrives in full sun and well-draining, possibly gypsum-rich soil, mirroring its native Chihuahuan Desert environment. Mimic its arid climate by watering sparingly and allowing the soil to fully dry between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; adapted to nutrient-poor, gypsum soils. A light, balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
