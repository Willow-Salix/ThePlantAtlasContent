| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Dry Forests, Arid Scrubland, Semi-arid zones. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily). It thrives in bright, intense light, mimicking its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent but thorough watering during the active growing season (spring and summer), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly or cease entirely during its dormant period in winter. |

## Introduction
Mammillaria is one of the largest genera in the cactus family (Cactaceae), with currently 200 known species and varieties recognized. Most of the mammillarias are native to Mexico, while some come from the Southwestern United States, the Caribbean, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras and Venezuela. The common name "pincushion cactus" refers to this genus and the closely related Escobaria.
The first species was described by Carl Linnaeus as Cactus mammillaris in 1753, deriving its name from the Latin mammilla, "nipple", referring to the tubercles that are among the distinctive features of the genus. Numerous species are commonly known as globe cactus, nipple cactus, birthday cake cactus, fishhook cactus or pincushion cactus (though such terms are also commonly used for related taxa, such as Escobaria or Ferocactus).

## Care Guide
This cactus requires abundant sunlight, mimicking its native arid and semi-arid environments. Water infrequently and deeply, ensuring the soil completely dries out to prevent rot. Use well-draining soil and provide light fertilization during the warmer months for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization is needed during the growing season, typically once every 2-4 weeks with a diluted, low-nitrogen fertilizer formulated for cacti and succulents. Native soils are generally nutrient-poor.
