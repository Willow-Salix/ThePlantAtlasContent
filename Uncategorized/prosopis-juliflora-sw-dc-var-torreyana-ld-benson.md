## 🌱 Overview
Prosopis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. The current circumscription of the genus contains three species found in northern Africa, the Middle East, Central and South Asia. Previously it also contained around 40 species of spiny trees and shrubs found in subtropical and tropical regions of the Americas and Africa, now mostly placed in genera Strombocarpa and Neltuma. They often thrive in arid soil and are resistant to drought, on occasion developing extremely deep root systems. Their wood is usually hard, dense and durable. Their fruits are pods and may contain large amounts of sugar. The generic name means "burdock" in late Latin and originated in the Greek language.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires very little water once established, tolerating long periods of drought. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Ensure well-draining soil and ample space for its extensive root system.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally does not require supplemental fertilization in appropriate soils.
