## Care Guide
Marsh Yellowcress thrives in very moist to wet conditions, mimicking its native temperate marshland habitat. It prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently wet soil, making it suitable for bog gardens or pond margins. Minimal fertilization is usually needed if soil is rich in organic matter.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from organic matter enrichment in the soil. A balanced, general-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth is poor.
