## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Nye County Fishhook Cactus thrives in conditions mirroring its native arid desert. It demands full, intense sunlight and extremely infrequent watering, allowing the soil to completely dry out between applications. Fertilization is rarely necessary, aligning with its natural lean soil environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. If fertilizing, use a highly diluted, low-nitrogen fertilizer specifically for cacti and succulents, once or twice during the active growing season.
