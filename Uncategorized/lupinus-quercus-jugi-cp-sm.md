## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native thrives in full sun with well-draining soil, adapted to the wet winter and dry summer patterns of a Mediterranean climate. Provide moderate water during its growing season but allow it to remain dry during summer dormancy. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers as it fixes its own nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in poorer soils and can be harmed by high-nitrogen fertilizers. If soil is extremely deficient, a very light application of phosphorus and potassium may be considered.
