| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Scrubland and Pine Flatwoods |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Shade (thrives with good sun exposure) |

## 🌱 Overview
Asimina is a genus of small trees or shrubs described as a genus in 1763. Asimina is the only temperate genus in the tropical and subtropical flowering plant family Annonaceae. Asimina have large, simple leaves and large fruit. It is native to eastern North America and collectively referred to as pawpaw. The genus includes the widespread common pawpaw Asimina triloba, which bears the largest edible fruit indigenous to the United States. Pawpaws are native to 26 states of the U.S. and to Ontario in Canada. The common pawpaw is a patch-forming (clonal) understory tree found in well-drained, deep, fertile bottomland and hilly upland habitat. Pawpaws are in the same plant family (Annonaceae) as the custard apple, cherimoya, sweetsop, soursop, and ylang-ylang;  the genus is the only member of that family not confined to the tropics. Fossils date to the Cretaceous.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Florida Pawpaw thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-draining, sandy soils, characteristic of its native scrubland habitat. Water moderately, ensuring the soil dries slightly between waterings, and fertilize sparingly due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions. Avoid heavy, waterlogged soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Apply a slow-release, balanced fertilizer sparingly, primarily if growth is poor. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
