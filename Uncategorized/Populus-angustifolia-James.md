| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Riparian Woodlands (found along streams and rivers in mountainous and intermountain regions) |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun exposure (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) to thrive, reflecting its natural occurrence in open, sunny riverbanks. |
| **💧 Water** | Demands consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native habitat along watercourses. Requires regular and deep watering, especially when young, and tolerates periodic flooding but not prolonged drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Populus angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf cottonwood, is a species of tree in the willow family (Salicaceae). It is native to western North America, where it is a characteristic species of the Rocky Mountains and the surrounding plains. It ranges north to the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan in Canada and south to the states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Sonora in Mexico.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Narrowleaf Cottonwood thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil, characteristic of its native riparian habitats. Ensure ample water supply, especially during establishment, and provide moderate fertilization to support its rapid growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization, particularly in its early growth stages, as it is a fast-growing tree in naturally rich riparian soils. A balanced all-purpose fertilizer can be applied in spring.
