## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah) and northern Baja California, Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun exposure, typical of its native open desert and scrubland habitats. It thrives in high light conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently but deeply, allowing the soil to completely dry out between waterings. Overwatering, especially in poorly draining soil, can be detrimental. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mojave Gilia thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, typical of its arid native environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, with care taken to avoid overwatering. Fertilization is rarely needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. This plant is adapted to lean, sandy, or rocky soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization. If desired, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer could be applied sparingly once a year in spring.
