## Care Guide
This wetland plant thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet to submerged soil, replicating its native marsh environment. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is well-adapted to extract nutrients from its watery habitat. Ensure it never dries out for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of a balanced aquatic plant fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if grown in containers, but generally not critical in rich wetland soils.
