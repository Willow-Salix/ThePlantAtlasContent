## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central Mexico, particularly mountainous regions |
| **Climate** | Temperate Highland (Pine-Oak Forests, Montane Meadows) |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial sun, typical of open montane environments where it receives ample light. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate and consistent watering, especially during the growing season, but needs excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Tolerates brief dry periods once established. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
Hartweg's Beardtongue thrives in full to partial sun with moderate, consistent watering and excellent soil drainage, mimicking its native montane habitat. Fertilize lightly in spring, avoiding over-fertilization to ensure strong blooms and compact growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from light feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring. Excessive fertilization can lead to lush foliage at the expense of flowers and leggy growth; prefers moderately fertile, well-draining soil.
