## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States |
| **Climate** | Warm Temperate Grassland/Open Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is ideal, reflecting its native open, exposed habitats like prairies, sandhills, and dunes. |
| **Watering** | Prefers well-drained to dry conditions; it is drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry out between waterings, consistent with its adaptation to sandy, quickly draining soils. |

## Introduction
Lithospermum is a genus of plants belonging to the family Boraginaceae. The genus is distributed nearly worldwide, but most are native to the Americas and the center of diversity is in the southwestern United States and Mexico. Species are known generally as gromwells or stoneseeds.

## Care Guide
Carolina Puccoon is a robust perennial native to the sandy, open environments of the southeastern U.S. It requires full sun and excellent drainage, thriving on minimal water once established. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization to best mimic its natural, lean growing conditions.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils typical of its sandy native habitats. Fertilization is generally not necessary and can be detrimental. If soil is extremely poor, a very light, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring might be considered, but avoid rich soils.
