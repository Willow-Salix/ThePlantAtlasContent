## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in full sun with well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native montane habitats. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Minimal fertilization is required.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilizer needs, as native alpine soils are typically lean.
