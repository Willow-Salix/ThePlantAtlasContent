## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions across Europe, North America, and Asia |
| **Climate** | Cool-Temperate Humid Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light; thrives in shaded, sheltered forest understories away from direct sun. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is crucial. Requires consistent moisture absorption from ambient air and occasional misting; sensitive to prolonged desiccation. |

## Introduction
Bacidia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. These lichens are characterised by their crustose growth form, distinctive club-shaped reproductive structures called apothecia that contain long, needle-like spores, and their symbiotic partnership with green algae. Bacidia species typically grow on various substrates including tree bark, rock surfaces, and occasionally soil, and are distinguished from related genera by their specific spore characteristics and internal structures.

## Care Guide
As a lichen, Bacidia luteola thrives in high humidity and low to moderate indirect light, typical of cool-temperate, humid forests. It requires consistent moisture from the environment rather than root watering, and obtains all necessary nutrients from the air and its substrate, thus no fertilization is needed. Maintaining a stable, humid environment is paramount for its survival.

### Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer needed; obtains nutrients from atmospheric deposition and its substrate.
