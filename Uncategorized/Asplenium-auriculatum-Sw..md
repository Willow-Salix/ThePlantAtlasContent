## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Neotropical region, including Mexico, Central America, northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador), and the Caribbean islands. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to partial shade. As an understory or epiphytic fern, it thrives away from direct sunlight, which can scorch its fronds. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged. Requires high humidity, replicating frequent rainfall and humid air of its native environment. Water frequently, allowing the top layer of substrate to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Asplenium is a genus of about 700 species of ferns, often treated as the only genus in the family Aspleniaceae, though other authors consider Hymenasplenium separate, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, a different chromosome count, and structural differences in the rhizomes. The type species for the genus is Asplenium marinum.
The most common vernacular name is spleenworts, applied to the more "typical" species. A. nidus and several similar species are called bird's-nest ferns, the Camptosorus group is known as walking ferns, and distinct names are applied to some other particularly well-known species.

## Care Guide
This Treetrunk Spleenwort, native to neotropical rainforests, requires consistent moisture, high humidity, and indirect light to thrive. Plant in a well-draining medium and water frequently, ensuring the soil remains moist but never waterlogged. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted solution during its active growing season.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., half-strength) during the active growing season (spring/summer), typically once a month or every other month. Avoid over-fertilization.
