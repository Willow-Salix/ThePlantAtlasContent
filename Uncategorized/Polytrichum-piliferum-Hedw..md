## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Globally widespread in temperate, arctic, and alpine regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, and parts of the Southern Hemisphere. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Arctic/Alpine Tundra, Heathlands, Moorlands |
| **Sunlight** | High direct to bright indirect light. Thrives in exposed, open conditions, not under dense canopy. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to infrequent watering. Allow the substrate to dry out significantly between waterings, as it tolerates periods of desiccation. |

## Introduction
Polytrichum is a genus of mosses — commonly called haircap moss or hair moss — which contains approximately 70 species that have a cosmopolitan distribution.
The genus Polytrichum has a number of closely related sporophytic characters. The scientific name is derived from the Ancient Greek words polys, meaning "many", and thrix, meaning "hair". This name was used in ancient times to refer to plants with fine, hairlike parts, including mosses, but this application specifically refers to the hairy calyptras found on young sporophytes. A similar naming related to hair appears in Old Norse, haddr silfjar, "hair of Sif", goddess from Norse Mythology, wife of the god Thor. There are two major sections of Polytrichum species. The first — section Polytrichum — has narrow, toothed, and relatively erect leaf margins. The other — section Juniperifolia — has broad, entire,  and sharply inflexed leaf margins that enclose the lamellae on the upper leaf surface.

## Care Guide
Polytrichum Moss prefers bright, open conditions and well-draining, acidic soil. It is adapted to periods of drought, requiring moderate to infrequent watering and no fertilization. Mimicking its natural habitat on exposed, nutrient-poor sites is key to its care.

### Fertilizer
Very low. This moss thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils; fertilization is generally unnecessary and potentially harmful.
