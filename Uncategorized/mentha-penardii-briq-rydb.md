## 🧤 Care Instructions
Penard's Mint thrives with ample sunlight to partial shade and requires consistently moist soil, replicating its natural riparian environment. Fertilization needs are minimal, preferring a balanced approach or soil enriched with organic matter. Ensure consistent moisture to mimic its native wet meadow habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not a heavy feeder; a light application of balanced, all-purpose fertilizer or the incorporation of rich organic matter into the soil is sufficient, applied sparingly.
