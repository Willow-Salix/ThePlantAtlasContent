## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Elephant Foot Yam thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright indirect light, mimicking its tropical forest floor habitat. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil during its vigorous growth phase, then greatly reduce watering as it enters dormancy. Regular feeding with a balanced fertilizer will support its large foliage and eventual bloom.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed regularly with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing period. Reduce or stop fertilization during dormancy.
