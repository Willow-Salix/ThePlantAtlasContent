## Introduction
Zephyranthes  is a genus of temperate and tropical bulbous plants in the Amaryllis family, subfamily Amaryllidoideae, native to the Americas and widely cultivated as ornamentals. Following the expansion of the genus in 2019, which now includes the genera Habranthus and Sprekelia, there are about 200 recognized species, as well as numerous hybrids and cultivars. Common names for species in this genus include fairy lily, rainflower, zephyr lily, magic lily, Atamasco lily,  and rain lily.
The name is derived from Ζέφυρος (Zephyrus), the Greek god of the west wind, and ἄνθος (anthos), meaning flower, referring to the slender stalks.

## Care Guide
This rain lily thrives in conditions mimicking its native Texas prairies, requiring full to partial sun and moderate watering. It prefers well-draining soil and will respond with prolific blooms after significant rainfall or watering following dry periods. Provide light to moderate fertilization during its growing season for best results.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a liquid feed diluted to half strength during the active growing season (spring through summer).
