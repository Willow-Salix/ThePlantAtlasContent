| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in bright, exposed conditions characteristic of mountain slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during cooler months. Adapt to seasonal rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Verbesina, many species of which have crownbeard as part of their common names, is a genus of flowering plants, in the family Asteraceae. It is a large genus of about 350 species.
All of the species bear white or yellow flowers similar to small sunflowers. The name Verbesina very likely refers to the similarity of the foliage to that of the (unrelated) Verbena.
Verbesina species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species. These include Schinia bina, which has been recorded from V. encelioides, and Schinia siren which feeds exclusively on that species.
Pollen grains from eight of the nine species of Verbesina found in Brazil have been characterized as oblate-spheroidal, medium-sized, isopolar monads. They are 3-colplorate with a subtriangular amb, a small polar area, a long colpus, a lalongate endoaperture, a caveate exine and an echinate sexine.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Adapted to semi-arid montane environments, Mountain Crownbeard requires full sun and well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant, needing infrequent deep watering, and has low fertilizer requirements. Mimic its native conditions of bright exposure and dry periods for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Typically grows in lean, rocky soils; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if the soil is very poor.
