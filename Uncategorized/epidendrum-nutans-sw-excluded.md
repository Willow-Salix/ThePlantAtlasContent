## 🌱 Overview
Epidendrum , abbreviated Epi in the horticultural trade, is a large neotropical genus of the orchid family. With more than 1,500 species,  some authors describe it as a mega-genus. The genus name (from Greek επί, epi and δένδρον, dendron, "upon trees") refers to its epiphytic growth habit.
When Carl Linnaeus named this genus in 1763, he included in this genus all the epiphytic orchids known to him. Although few of these orchids are still included in the genus Epidendrum, some species of Epidendrum are nevertheless not epiphytic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest environment, requiring bright, indirect light and consistent moisture with good drainage. Provide high humidity and regular, diluted fertilization during its active growth periods for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize every 1-2 weeks during the active growing season with a diluted (1/4 to 1/2 strength) balanced orchid-specific fertilizer. Reduce or cease fertilization in cooler, less active periods.
