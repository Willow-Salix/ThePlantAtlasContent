## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate to Boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America (e.g., Eastern US, Canada), Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate/Boreal Peatlands and Bogs |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers moderate to bright indirect light. Can tolerate some partial sun in its naturally cool, wet environment but should be protected from intense, direct afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently waterlogged conditions, never allowed to dry out. High ambient humidity is essential, using distilled or rainwater to prevent mineral buildup. |

## Introduction
Sphagnum is a genus of approximately 380 accepted species of mosses, commonly known as sphagnum moss, also bog moss and quacker moss (although that term is also sometimes used for peat). Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16 to 26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions.
As Sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. Thus, Sphagnum can influence the composition of such habitats, with some describing Sphagnum as 'habitat manipulators' or 'autogenic ecosystem engineers'. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants.
Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions.
Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, and any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.

## Care Guide
Maintain consistently waterlogged, acidic conditions using distilled or rainwater, ensuring high ambient humidity. Provide moderate to bright indirect light and avoid any fertilizer, as this plant is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is needed or recommended. Sphagnum species are highly adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic conditions and are sensitive to mineral salts.
