## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Florida Biatorella Lichen thrives in high humidity and filtered light, characteristic of its subtropical forest origin. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere, thus traditional watering and fertilization are not required and can be detrimental. Mimic its humid, partially shaded natural habitat for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
