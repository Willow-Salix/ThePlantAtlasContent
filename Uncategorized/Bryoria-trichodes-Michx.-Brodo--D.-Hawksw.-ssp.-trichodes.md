## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Hemisphere, particularly circumboreal regions including widespread areas of North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Alaska, Canada), Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia), and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest, Temperate Coniferous Forest, Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect to filtered light, mimicking its growth on tree branches under a forest canopy. Avoid direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and frequent moisture from atmospheric sources like rain, fog, or dew. Regular misting is crucial, as it does not absorb water from soil. |

## Introduction
Bryoria is a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. Many members of this genus are known as horsehair lichens. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in boreal and cool temperate areas. These lichens typically grow as slender, hair-like strands that hang from conifer trees or form small bushes, ranging in colour from dark brown to pale grey. They play important ecological roles, particularly as winter food for caribou in northern forests, where some species can accumulate in large quantities in the forest canopy. The genus contains about 35 species found worldwide, with ongoing discoveries of new species especially in mountainous regions of Asia and western North America.

## Care Guide
Horsehair lichen thrives in cool, highly humid conditions with good air circulation and indirect light. As it absorbs moisture directly from the air, frequent misting or a very humid environment is crucial. No traditional fertilization is needed, as artificial nutrients would likely be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Lichens obtain nutrients from the atmosphere, and artificial fertilizers would likely be detrimental.
