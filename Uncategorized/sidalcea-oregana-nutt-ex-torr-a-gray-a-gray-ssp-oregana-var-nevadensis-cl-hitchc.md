## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin regions of California, Nevada, Oregon, and Idaho. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, exposed locations characteristic of meadows. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is crucial, particularly during the growing season. Native to moist meadows and stream banks, it requires regular watering if not in a naturally moist environment, avoiding waterlogged conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistent moisture, mimicking its native habitat in moist montane meadows. Regular watering is crucial, especially during the growing season, and it prefers average to rich soil. With these conditions, it will exhibit healthy growth and vibrant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from average to rich soil, often found in nutrient-rich meadow environments. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring if soil is poor.
