## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives on neglect, requiring full sun and very infrequent watering, especially in cooler months, to prevent root rot. Provide extremely well-draining, lean soil and minimal fertilization to mimic its arid native habitat and ensure robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs. Fertilize sparingly (once or twice per growing season) with a diluted, balanced cactus-specific fertilizer, or not at all if repotting regularly.
