## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Sierra Nevada, California, USA (Kaweah River drainage) |
| **Climate** | Montane Riparian (within a Mediterranean climate) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers good light, but partial shade can be beneficial in hotter climates or during peak summer to prevent drying out. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, but well-drained. Mimics its native stream-side habitat; never allow the soil to dry out completely, especially during the growing season. |

## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
The Kaweah Monkeyflower thrives in consistently moist, well-drained soil, replicating its native montane riparian habitat. It prefers full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering to prevent the soil from drying out. Fertilization should be light, aligning with its adaptation to less nutrient-rich environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced liquid fertilizer or incorporation of organic matter can be provided sparingly during the growing season, but avoid over-fertilization.
