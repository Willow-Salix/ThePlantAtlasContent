## 🌱 Overview
Alopecurus, or foxtail grass, is a common and widespread genus of plants in the grass family. It is common across temperate and subtropical parts of Eurasia, northern Africa, and the Americas, as well as naturalized in Australia and on various islands.
Foxtails can be annual or perennial. They grow in tufts. They have flat leaves and blunt ligules (a small flap at the junction of leaf and stem). Their inflorescence is a dense panicle (a branching head without terminal flower) with 1-flowered spikelets. A few, particularly A. myosuroides, are considered weeds, others are very decorative and are used in bouquets of dried flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Howell's Foxtail thrives in consistently moist to wet soil and prefers full to partial sun, reflecting its native wetland habitat in western North America. It is crucial to prevent the soil from drying out, and it generally requires minimal fertilization, especially in organically rich soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. In naturally rich, moist soils, additional fertilization may not be necessary. If growth appears weak, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial.
