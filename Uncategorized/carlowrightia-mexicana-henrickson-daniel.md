## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North-central Mexico, particularly states such as Coahuila and Nuevo León. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland (Chihuahuan Desert region) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; requires bright, direct light for optimal growth, similar to its exposure in open desert scrub. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Infrequent but deep watering is preferred during active growth, with minimal watering during cooler or dormant periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Carlowrightia is a genus of flowering plants in the bear's breeches family, Acanthaceae. Members of the genus, commonly known as wrightworts, are mainly small shrubs bearing inflorescences of lily-like flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in conditions mirroring its arid Mexican origin, Mexican Wrightwort demands full to partial sun and excellent drainage. Water infrequently but deeply, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between sessions, and apply fertilizer very sparingly. Mimicking its dry, sunny native habitat is key to successful cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; its native arid soils are often lean. A light, balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally fertile soil.
