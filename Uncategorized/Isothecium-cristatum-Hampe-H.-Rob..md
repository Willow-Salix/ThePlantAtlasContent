## Care Guide
Isothecium moss thrives in consistently moist, shaded environments typical of temperate forests. Provide very low, indirect light and maintain high humidity with frequent watering to keep its substrate damp, ensuring good drainage. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its low nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required. If growth seems stunted, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly once or twice a year.
