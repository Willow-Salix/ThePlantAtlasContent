## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mountainous regions of Eastern Asia, particularly Western Sichuan, China |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, especially in cooler climates or higher elevations, reflecting its open mountain habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, ensuring excellent drainage. Allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings, mimicking the well-drained rocky slopes of its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## Care Guide
Red Fruit Bearberry thrives in cool, high-altitude conditions, preferring full to partial sun and well-drained, lean, acidic soils. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and avoid heavy fertilization to mimic its native alpine environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils typical of alpine regions, so excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
