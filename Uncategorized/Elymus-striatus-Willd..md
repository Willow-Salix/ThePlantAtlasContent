## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (spanning much of the United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forests and Grasslands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating a range of light conditions from open fields to forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptability to fluctuating rainfall in temperate zones. |

## Introduction
Elymus trachycaulus is a species of wild rye known by the common name slender wheatgrass. It is native to much of North America.  It grows in widely varied habitats from northern Canada to Mexico, but is absent from most of the southeastern United States.
It is variable in appearance, but generally bears a very narrow, linear inflorescence of spikelets appressed against the stem. There are three subspecies, two very widespread and one which is limited to Greenland.

## Care Guide
Slender Wheatgrass is a hardy native grass of North America, flourishing in temperate climates with full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering but becomes drought-tolerant once established, adapting well to average soil fertility, making it a robust and low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; this plant is adapted to average soil fertility typical of its native habitats and does not generally require heavy fertilization.
