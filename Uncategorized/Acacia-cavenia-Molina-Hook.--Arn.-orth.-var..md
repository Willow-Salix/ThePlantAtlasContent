## Care Guide
Acacia cavenia, or Espino, thrives in full sun and is exceptionally drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established. It prefers well-draining soil and does not generally need significant fertilization. Mimicking its native semi-arid and Mediterranean conditions is key to its successful growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. If desired, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially in very poor soils.
