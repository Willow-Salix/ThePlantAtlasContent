## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States (e.g., Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon) and Canada (e.g., British Columbia, Alberta). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | As a parasitic plant growing on the outer branches of its host larch trees, Arceuthobium laricis is exposed to and thrives in conditions where the host receives full sun. |
| **Watering** | This mistletoe is entirely dependent on its host tree for water, drawing it directly from the host's xylem. Its water availability is dictated by the health of the host and the consistent, moderate to high precipitation typical of temperate coniferous forests. |

## Introduction
The genus Arceuthobium, commonly called dwarf mistletoes, is a genus of 42 species of parasitic plants that parasitize members of Pinaceae and Cupressaceae in North America, Central America, Asia, Europe, and Africa. Of the 42 species that have been recognized, 39 and 21 of these are endemic to North America and the United States, respectively. They all have very reduced shoots and leaves (mostly reduced to scales) with the bulk of the plant living under the host's bark. Recently the number of species within the genus has been reduced to 26 as a result of more detailed genetic analysis.

## Care Guide
As an obligate parasite, Larch Dwarf Mistletoe cannot be cultivated independently. Its 'care' is intrinsically linked to the health and vitality of its host larch tree, which requires full sun exposure and the consistent moisture levels characteristic of its native temperate coniferous forest environment. The mistletoe itself does not require direct watering or fertilization, as it sources all resources from its host.

### Fertilizer
Being a parasitic plant, it obtains all necessary nutrients directly from its host tree via specialized root-like structures (haustoria). It does not absorb nutrients from the soil and therefore does not require external fertilization.
