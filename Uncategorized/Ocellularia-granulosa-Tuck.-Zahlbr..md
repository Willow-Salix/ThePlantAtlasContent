## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in a highly humid environment with indirect or filtered light, typical of subtropical forest understories. Ensure constant moisture through misting or high ambient humidity, while also providing good air circulation to prevent fungal issues. No supplemental fertilization is needed.

### Fertilizer
