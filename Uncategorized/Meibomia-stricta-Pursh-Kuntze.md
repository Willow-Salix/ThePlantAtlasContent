## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (specifically in well-drained pinelands and savannas) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. It thrives in open, sunny areas characteristic of its native pinebarren habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. It is adapted to sandy soils that drain quickly, tolerating periods of dryness but preferring consistent moisture. Allow soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. Species are distributed widely – from Quebec to northern Argentina in the Americas, across northern and southern tropical Africa, in the southern Arabian Peninsula, in Myanmar and Thailand, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained, sandy soils, mimicking its native pineland environment. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and has low fertilizer needs due to its adaptation to poor soils and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low. As a plant native to nutrient-poor sandy pinelands and a member of the legume family (nitrogen-fixing), it requires minimal fertilizer.
