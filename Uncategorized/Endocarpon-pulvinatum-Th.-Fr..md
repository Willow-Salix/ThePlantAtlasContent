## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and alpine regions, including Scandinavia, the Alps, and North America (e.g., Greenland, Alaska, Rocky Mountains). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High direct light to full sun, typical of exposed rock surfaces in open, treeless environments. |
| **Watering** | Irregular moisture from natural precipitation (rain, snowmelt, dew) followed by periods of dryness. Tolerates significant desiccation, rehydrating quickly when moisture is available. |

## Introduction
Endocarpon is a genus of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), squamulose lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. It comprises 23 species. The genus is characterised by its enclosed fruiting bodies (perithecia) embedded within the scales and its compartmentalised spores. Species in this genus typically grow on rocks, often in areas that experience periodic moisture.

## Care Guide
To care for this lichen, provide high direct light mimicking its exposed rock habitat in arctic and alpine regions. Ensure irregular moisture from misting or occasional watering, allowing for dry periods, as it thrives without traditional soil nutrients.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. This lichen thrives in nutrient-poor environments, absorbing necessary elements directly from air and rainwater.
