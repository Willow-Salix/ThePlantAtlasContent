## Care Guide
The Abyssinian Milkvetch thrives in full sun, reflecting its origins in semi-arid African grasslands. It requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Being a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced, slow-release formula can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
