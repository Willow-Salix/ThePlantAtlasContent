## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (Central and Southern regions) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure, typical of open chaparral, grasslands, and woodland edges in its native habitat where it receives direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Adapted to a Mediterranean climate, it prefers a distinct wet and dry season. Water moderately during cooler, active growth periods (winter/spring) and significantly reduce or cease watering during hot, dry summers to mimic its natural drought dormancy. |

## Introduction
Carduus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, and the tribe Cardueae, one of two genera considered to be true thistles, the other being Cirsium. Plants of the genus are known commonly as plumeless thistles. They are native to temperate Eurasia and North Africa, and several are known elsewhere as introduced species. This genus is noted for its disproportionately high number of noxious weeds compared to other flowering plant genera.

## Care Guide
Truncate Thistle thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, mirroring its native Mediterranean scrubland environment. Provide moderate water during its winter-spring growing season and allow it to dry out significantly during summer dormancy, with minimal fertilizer required.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Thrives in the typically lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soils of its native habitat. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, during the active growing season with a balanced, slow-release formula.
