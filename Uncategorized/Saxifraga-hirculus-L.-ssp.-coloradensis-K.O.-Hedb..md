## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Rocky Mountains of western North America (USA: Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico, Arizona) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra/Subalpine Montane Bogs and Fens |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; thrives in open, bright conditions but appreciates protection from intense afternoon sun in warmer climates. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil; requires frequent watering and should never be allowed to dry out, mimicking its native bog and fen habitats. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
This alpine bog saxifrage requires consistently moist to wet soil and cool conditions to thrive. It prefers good light exposure, but should be shielded from intense afternoon sun, especially in warmer regions. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-lean environments.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. If soil is exceptionally lean, a very light, balanced fertilizer application once a year may be considered.
