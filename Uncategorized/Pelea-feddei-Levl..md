## Introduction
The Alans (Latin: Alani) were an ancient and medieval Iranic nomadic pastoral people who migrated to what is today North Caucasus; some continued on to Europe and later North Africa. They are generally regarded as part of the Sarmatians, and possibly related to the Massagetae. Modern historians have connected the Alans with the Central Asian Yancai of Chinese sources and with the Aorsi of Roman sources. Having migrated westwards and becoming dominant among the Sarmatians on the Pontic–Caspian steppe, the Alans are mentioned by Roman sources in the 1st century CE. At that time they had settled the region north of the Black Sea and frequently raided the Parthian Empire and the South Caucasus provinces of the Roman Empire. From 215 to 250 CE the Goths broke their power on the Pontic Steppe, thereby assimilating a sizeable portion of the associated Alans.
Upon the Hunnic defeat of the Goths on the Pontic Steppe around 375 CE, many of the Alans migrated westwards along with various Germanic tribes. They crossed the Rhine in 406 along with the Vandals and Suebi, settling in Orléans and Valence. Around 409 they joined the Vandals and Suebi in crossing the Pyrenees into the Iberian Peninsula, settling in Lusitania and Hispania Carthaginensis. The Iberian Alans, soundly defeated by the Visigoths in 418, subsequently surrendered their authority to the Hasdingi Vandals. In 428 CE, the Vandals and Alans crossed the Strait of Gibraltar into North Africa, where they founded a kingdom which lasted until its conquest by forces of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I in 534.
Eventually in the 9th century those Alans who remained under Hunnic rule established the regionally powerful kingdom of Alania in the Northern Caucasus. It survived until the Mongol invasions of the 13th century. Various scholars regard these Alans as the ancestors of the modern Ossetians.
The Alans spoke an Eastern Iranian language which derived from Scytho-Sarmatian; in turn, the language evolved into the modern Ossetian language. The name Alan represents an Eastern Iranian dialectal form of Old Iranian term Aryan, and so is cognate with the name of the country Īrān (from the gen. plur. *aryānām).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native Hawaiian mesic to wet forests, preferring partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide regular watering and maintain high humidity, fertilizing sparingly during active growth for best health.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer), reducing or stopping in winter.
