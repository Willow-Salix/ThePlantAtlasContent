## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wetland hybrid thrives in consistently wet to submerged conditions, ideally under full to partial sun exposure. It prefers nutrient-rich, mucky soils. Ensure constant water availability and provide moderate fertilization for healthy growth, mimicking its natural aquatic environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization in nutrient-rich, mucky soil, characteristic of decomposing organic matter in wetland ecosystems.
