# Synoicous Midget-moss

*Nanomitrium synoicum (James) Lindb.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (e.g., Northeastern United States, Eastern Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to bright indirect light; can tolerate partial sun, but avoid intense, prolonged direct sun which can lead to drying. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently damp, but not waterlogged, substrate. High ambient humidity is crucial, achieved through regular misting or a terrarium environment. |

## Care Guide
This temperate moss thrives in consistently damp conditions with high humidity and moderate to bright indirect light. Ensure the substrate never dries out and avoid intense direct sunlight. Minimal fertilization is required for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Mosses are low-nutrient feeders and often thrive in relatively nutrient-poor soil.
