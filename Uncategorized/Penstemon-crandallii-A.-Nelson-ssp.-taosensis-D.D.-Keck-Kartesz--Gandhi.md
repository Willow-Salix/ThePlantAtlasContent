## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North-central New Mexico, USA (specifically the Taos region and surrounding mountains) |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, high-altitude native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Drought-tolerant once established; prefers deep, infrequent watering. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot, mimicking its native arid conditions. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
Taos Penstemon thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soil, reflecting its semi-arid montane origins. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal watering and fertilization, preferring conditions that mimic its native high-altitude environment.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean, well-draining soil and generally does not require frequent fertilization. Excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
