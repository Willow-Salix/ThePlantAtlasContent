## Introduction
Spiraea , sometimes spelled spirea in common names, and commonly known as meadowsweets or steeplebushes, is a genus of about 80 to 100 species of shrubs in the family Rosaceae. They are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest diversity in eastern Asia.
The genus formerly included the herbaceous species now segregated into the genera Filipendula and Aruncus; recent genetic evidence has shown that Filipendula is only distantly related to Spiraea, belonging in the subfamily Rosoideae.

## Care Guide
Fortune Meadowsweet is a relatively low-maintenance shrub that prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular watering during dry spells and light annual fertilization in spring will help ensure vigorous growth and abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Light; an annual application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost in early spring is generally sufficient.
