## Care Guide
This pine thrives in full sun and very well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its native subtropical scrubland habitat. It requires moderate watering, tolerating dry periods once established, and prefers low to moderate nutrient levels, adapting to its naturally poor soil origins.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Native to nutrient-poor sandy soils, so it does not require rich feeding; excessive fertilizer can be detrimental.
