## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (including parts of the United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodlands and Prairies |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; thrives in open, exposed areas typical of clearings and prairie edges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low; prefers well-drained soil and is tolerant of dry spells once established, reflecting its habitat on dry banks and prairies. Water regularly during prolonged dry periods, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Calystegia (bindweed, false bindweed, or morning glory) is a genus of about 25 species of flowering plants in the bindweed family Convolvulaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution in temperate and subtropical regions, but with half of the species endemic to California.  They are annual or herbaceous perennial twining vines growing 1–5 m tall, with spirally arranged leaves. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, 3–10 cm diameter, white or pink, with (in most species) a sometimes inflated basal epicalyx.
The genus bears much similarity to a related genus Convolvulus, and is sometimes combined with it; it is distinguished primarily by the pollen being smooth, and in the ovary being unilocular.
Some of the species, notably Calystegia sepium and C. silvatica, are problematic weeds, which can swamp other more valuable plants by climbing over them, but some are also deliberately grown for their attractive flowers.
Calystegia species are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Bedellia somnulentella (recorded on C. sepium) and small angle shades.
The name is derived from two Greek words κάλυξ (kálux) "cup", and στέγη (stégē) "a covering", meaning "covering cup", this refers to the large bracts that cover the sepals.

## Care Guide
This bindweed variety thrives in temperate climates with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate to low watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilization is generally not critical, making it a low-maintenance plant adapted to natural soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial, especially in very poor soils, but often it thrives with existing soil nutrients.
