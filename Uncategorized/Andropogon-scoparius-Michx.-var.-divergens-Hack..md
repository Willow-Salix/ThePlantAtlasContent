## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America, primarily across the Great Plains and prairies of the central and eastern United States, extending into southern Canada and northern Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland (Prairie/Savanna) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its natural habitat in open, exposed prairies. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; highly drought-tolerant once established due to its deep root system adapted to variable prairie rainfall. Water deeply but infrequently. |

## Introduction
Schizachyrium scoparium, commonly known as little bluestem or beard grass, is a species of North American prairie grass native to most of the contiguous United States (except California, Nevada, and Oregon) as well as a small area north of the Canada–US border and northern Mexico. It is most common in the Midwestern prairies and is one of the most abundant native plants in Texas grasslands.
Little bluestem is a perennial bunchgrass and is prominent in tallgrass prairies, along with big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). It is a warm-season species, meaning it employs the C4 photosynthetic pathway.

## Care Guide
This warm-season prairie grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native grassland environment. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and no fertilization, making it a highly low-maintenance and resilient plant.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Native prairie soils are often lean, and this plant is adapted to thrive in poor to moderately fertile conditions without supplemental feeding.
