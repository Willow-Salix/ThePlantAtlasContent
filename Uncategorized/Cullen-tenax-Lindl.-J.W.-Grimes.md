## Introduction
Cullen tenax, commonly known as emu foot, is a herbaceous, perennial shrub. Often found in forest or on heavy soils in medium to low rainfall areas in south eastern Australia.
It was first described in 1838 as Psoralea tenax by John Lindley, but was reassigned to the genus Cullen in 1996 by James Walter Grimes.

## Care Guide
Cullen tenax, originating from the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia, demands full sun and excellent drainage. It is extremely drought-tolerant, necessitating infrequent watering where the soil completely dries out between sessions. Fertilization should be minimal, aligning with its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to poor to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
