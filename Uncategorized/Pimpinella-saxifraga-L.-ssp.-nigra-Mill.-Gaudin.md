## Care Guide
This temperate European plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimicking its natural grassland habitat, it prefers moderate fertility and is relatively low-maintenance, requiring infrequent fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native to moderately fertile soils, it generally does not require heavy feeding. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring is sufficient if the soil is poor.
