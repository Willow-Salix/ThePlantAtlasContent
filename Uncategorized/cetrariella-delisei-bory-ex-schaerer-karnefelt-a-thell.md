| **🌡️ Climate** | Polar and Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; typically exposed to strong, cold light in open tundra environments. Requires bright, but not intensely hot, light. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires frequent moisture from high humidity, fog, dew, and precipitation (rain, snowmelt) to be metabolically active. Tolerates prolonged dry periods by going dormant, but needs regular rehydration. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cetrariella delisei is an arctic-alpine lichen demanding cold, exposed, and consistently humid conditions with regular periods of moisture for active growth. It tolerates dry dormancy but is highly sensitive to warmth, pollution, and excess nutrients. Successful cultivation outside its native environment is extremely challenging and typically requires specialized cold terrarium setups.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient requirements. Highly sensitive to excess fertilizers and pollutants, typically deriving trace nutrients from air and precipitation.
