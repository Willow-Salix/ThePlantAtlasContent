## Introduction
Symphoricarpos is a small genus of about 15 species of deciduous shrubs in the family Caprifoliaceae. With the exception of the Chinese coralberry, S. sinensis, which is indigenous to western China, all species are native to North and Central America. The name of the genus is derived from the Ancient Greek words συμφορεῖν (sumphoreîn), meaning "to bear together", and καρπός (karpós), meaning "fruit". It refers to the closely packed clusters of berries the species produces. Species in the genus are known by several common names, including snowberry, waxberry and ghostberry.
Snowberry is a resilient plant able to withstand a variety of conditions. Their deep roots allow them to survive dry seasons,  and they have been known to grow in a variety of soil types such as light sandy soil, medium loamy soil and heavier clay soil. Snowberry plants are most commonly found low-to mid elevations, in forests, dry or moist openings, rocky hillsides or near riverbanks and streams. Snowberry plants are also able to grow in a wide range of acidic and basic pHs and sunlight conditions.

## Care Guide
Desert Snowberry is a highly drought-tolerant shrub perfect for arid landscapes, thriving in full sun with minimal water and no need for fertilizer. Its robust nature makes it an ideal low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils; fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
