## Care Guide
This rare Sierra Nevada native requires bright, direct light and excellent drainage to mimic its subalpine rocky slopes. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and use fertilizer sparingly to avoid over-enrichment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; native soils are typically lean. A diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season.
