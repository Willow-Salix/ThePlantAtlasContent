## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hentz's Phlox flourishes in full to partial sun with excellent drainage, mimicking its native sandhill and dry woodland habitats. Water moderately, letting the soil dry between sessions, and apply fertilizer sparingly as it is adapted to lean soil conditions. Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to lean, sandy soils. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial in very poor soils, but heavy fertilization is generally not needed.
