| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Tennessee, Alabama, and Arkansas) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Glade (within Temperate Deciduous Forest biome) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, as it originates from open limestone glades with high light exposure. |

## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Manhart's Sedge thrives in open, sunny locations with well-drained, moderately moist soil. It is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, requiring minimal to no fertilization. Protect from prolonged drought once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; native glade soils are often thin and low in nutrients, suggesting the plant is adapted to leaner conditions.
