## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil, mimicking its native arid steppe and montane environments. It is drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering once established, and generally needs little to no fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume (Fabaceae), it fixes its own nitrogen. Over-fertilization, particularly with nitrogen, can be detrimental. Generally, no fertilizer is needed in typical garden settings.
