## 🌱 Overview
Lespedeza is a genus of some 45 species (including nothospecies) of flowering plants in the pea family (Fabaceae), commonly known as bush clovers or (particularly East Asian species) Japanese clovers (hagi). The genus is native to warm temperate to subtropical regions of eastern North America, eastern and southern Asia and Australasia.
These shrubby plants or trailing vines belong to the "typical" legumes (Faboideae), with the peas and beans, though they are part of another tribe, the Desmodieae. Therein, they are treated as type genus of the smaller subtribe Lespedezinae, which unites the present genus and its presumed closest relatives, Campylotropis and Kummerowia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate shrub thrives in conditions mimicking its native Japanese forests, preferring full sun for best blooms. It requires moderate watering until established, becoming quite drought-tolerant afterward. As a legume, it naturally enriches the soil and has low fertilizer demands.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization needs due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. A balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil is very poor.
