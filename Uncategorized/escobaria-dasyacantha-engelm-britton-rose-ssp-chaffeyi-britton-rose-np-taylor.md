## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun conditions and requires excellent drainage. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to fully dry out between sessions, and fertilize minimally during the spring and summer growing period. Provide a dormant period with minimal water in winter.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Fertilize sparingly during the growing season (spring/summer) with a diluted cactus or succulent-specific fertilizer; no fertilization needed during dormancy.
