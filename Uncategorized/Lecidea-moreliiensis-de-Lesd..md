## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico (specifically Michoacán, around Morelia) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Highland (Pine-Oak Forests) |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to bright indirect light. Naturally found on tree bark or rocks, often under a forest canopy or in open, but not excessively harsh, conditions. |
| **Watering** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and regular moisture from rain or mist. Avoid prolonged periods of drought. Lichens absorb water directly from the environment. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
Care for Morelii's Lecidea Lichen involves providing a stable environment with moderate, indirect light and high humidity, mimicking its native subtropical highland habitat. Ensure regular moisture exposure through misting or a humid environment, as traditional watering and fertilization are not suitable due to its unique biological requirements and sensitivity to air purity.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens absorb nutrients from the air, rain, and substrate. They are very sensitive to air pollution and do not require traditional soil-based fertilizers.
