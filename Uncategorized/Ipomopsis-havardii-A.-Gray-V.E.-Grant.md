## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Oklahoma) and northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun, as it naturally grows in exposed desert and scrubland environments with intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently but deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to simulate its native arid rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Havard's Ipomopsis thrives in full sun and requires infrequent, deep watering due to its arid native climate. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, so fertilization should be minimal or unnecessary, making it a low-maintenance plant ideal for dry, sunny conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very dilute, balanced formula during its active growth period, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.
