## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
This Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its Mediterranean native habitat. It requires moderate watering during spring but becomes drought-tolerant once established, tolerating dry summers. Avoid over-fertilizing, especially with nitrogen, as it naturally enriches the soil.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and prefers leaner soils. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers, which can inhibit flowering.
