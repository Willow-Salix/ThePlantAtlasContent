# Orange Peel Clematis
### *Viticella orientalis (L.) W.A. Weber*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Asia, including the Himalayas, Afghanistan, China, Iran, and Turkey |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Steppe and Mountain Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings; it is highly drought-tolerant once established. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy climbing vine thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions typical of its native temperate scrublands. It requires moderate watering during establishment but becomes highly drought-tolerant, needing only minimal fertilization to flourish and produce its distinctive lantern-shaped flowers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; a light application of balanced fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient, especially if grown in poor soils.
