## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mountainous regions of Europe, including the Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathians, and Scandinavia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright light conditions, mimicking its natural habitat in open mountain meadows. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil. Regular watering is needed, ensuring the roots do not sit in waterlogged conditions, typical of alpine slopes with good drainage. |

## Introduction
Didymoplexis, commonly known as crystal orchids or as 双唇兰属 (shuang chun lan shu), is a genus of terrestrial leafless orchids in the family Orchidaceae, about twenty species of which have been described. Orchids in this genus have swollen, fleshy rhizomes and thin, pale, upright fleshy flowering stems with resupinate, bell-shaped white or pale yellowish brown flowers. They are native to Africa, Madagascar, Southeast Asia, Australia and various islands of the Pacific.

## Care Guide
To thrive, this plant requires cool temperatures, consistent moisture with excellent drainage, and bright, open light conditions. Mimic its subalpine meadow habitat by providing full to partial sun and lean, well-draining soil that stays moist but never waterlogged.

### Fertilizer
Light, infrequent fertilization. Native soils in subalpine meadows are typically lean, so a very dilute, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season is sufficient.
