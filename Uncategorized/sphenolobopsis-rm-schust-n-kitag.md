# Sphenolobopsis
### *Sphenolobopsis R.M. Schust. & N. Kitag.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate to Subarctic regions, including parts of North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Alaska), Asia (e.g., Japan), and Europe (e.g., Scotland, Norway). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate to Boreal/Subalpine Forest. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect bright light, mimicking a forest understory. Avoid direct sunlight, which can quickly dry out and damage the plant. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist; never allow the substrate to dry out. Requires very high ambient humidity, often found in constantly damp environments like stream banks or boggy areas. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sphenolobopsis, a liverwort, thrives in cool, highly humid environments with consistent moisture and low to indirect light, mimicking its native boreal or montane forest habitat. Avoid direct sun and drying out; fertilize very sparingly, if at all, as over-fertilization can be detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is typically required. If desired, apply a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly once or twice a year, as excessive nutrients can be harmful.
