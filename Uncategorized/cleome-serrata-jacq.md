## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Caribbean, Central America (e.g., Mexico), and Northern South America (e.g., Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical/Subtropical Grasslands and Dry Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and flowering, similar to its open, disturbed habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture during its active growing season. Water regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, mimicking seasonal tropical rainfall with good drainage. Tolerates brief dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cleome  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cleomaceae, commonly known as spider flowers, spider plants, spider weeds, or bee plants. Previously, it had been placed in the family Capparaceae, until DNA studies found the Cleomaceae genera to be more closely related to the Brassicaceae than the Capparaceae. Cleome and clammyweed (Polanisia dodecandra) can sometimes be confused. 
The genus sensu stricto includes about 170 species of herbaceous annual or perennial plants and shrubs. The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of the world. However, a recent DNA study failed to separate Cleome, Podandrogyne, and Polanisia from each other, so some taxonomists have abandoned the last two of these genera, treating them as part of Cleome sensu lato; in this case, Cleome contains about 275 species, the vast majority of the Cleomaceae.
The genus contains species which show an evolutionary progression from C3 to C4 photosynthesis. This, combined with it being very close to the Brassicaceae with the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, makes it an ideal genus in which to study the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. Morphological differences that demonstrate the transition from C3 to C4 include C3 species having leaves with more veins and larger bundle sheath cells. Also, species such as Cleome gynandra produce proteins needed for C4 photosynthesis. Three species independently acquired the C4 pathway, while others are C3–C4 intermediate or C4-like.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Toothed Spiderflower thrives in full sun and requires consistent moisture during its active growth, reflecting its native tropical and subtropical open habitats. It prefers average to moderately fertile soil and can benefit from periodic feeding to support its prolific flowering, ensuring good drainage is crucial.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer applied monthly during the growing season, or a slow-release granular fertilizer at planting. Over-fertilizing can lead to excessive foliage at the expense of flowers.
