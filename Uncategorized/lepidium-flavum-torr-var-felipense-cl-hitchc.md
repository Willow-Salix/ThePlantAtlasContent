## 🌱 Overview
Lepidium is a genus of plants in the mustard/cabbage family, Brassicaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. It includes familiar species such as garden cress, maca, and dittander. General common names include peppercress, peppergrass, pepperweed, and pepperwort.  Some species form tumbleweeds.
The genus name Lepidium is from Greek meaning 'small scale', which is thought to be derived from a folk medicine usage of the plant to treat leprosy, which cause small scales on the skin. Another meaning is related to the small scale-like fruit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires very little water, tolerating long dry periods. It prefers poor, well-draining soil and does not need frequent fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for arid gardens or xeriscaping.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nutrient requirements; thrives in lean, well-draining soils. Minimal to no fertilization is needed as it is adapted to nutrient-poor desert conditions.
