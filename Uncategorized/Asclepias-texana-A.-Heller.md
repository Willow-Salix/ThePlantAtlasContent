## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central Texas (primarily the Edwards Plateau region), USA |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Steppe / Savanna (characterized by open grasslands, prairies, and woodlands with hot summers and moderate, often seasonal, rainfall) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. For optimal flowering and vigorous growth, full sun (at least 6 hours direct sunlight daily) is preferred. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Supplemental deep watering may be beneficial during prolonged dry periods, especially in its first growing season. |

## Introduction
Asclepias is a genus of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants known as milkweeds, named for their latex, a milky substance containing cardiac glycosides termed cardenolides, exuded where cells are damaged. Most species are toxic to humans and many other species, primarily due to the presence of cardenolides. However, as with many such plants, some species feed upon milkweed leaves or the nectar from their flowers. A noteworthy feeder on milkweeds is the monarch butterfly, which uses and requires certain milkweeds as host plants for its larvae.
The Asclepias genus contains over 200 species distributed broadly across Africa, North America, and South America. It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.

## Care Guide
Texas Milkweed thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native central Texas habitat. It is a resilient, drought-tolerant perennial once established, needing minimal supplemental watering and no significant fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to leaner, well-draining soils and generally does not require regular fertilization. Over-fertilization can sometimes hinder flowering.
