# Sphagnum Moss
### *Sphagnum lindbergii Schimp. ssp. lenense (H. Lindb.) Podp.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern Circumpolar regions, including subarctic and arctic areas of Eurasia (e.g., Siberia) and North America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Boreal to Arctic, specifically acidic peatlands, bogs, and fens within Taiga and Tundra biomes |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial sun to partial shade. Prefers cooler, diffuse light and can tolerate periods of direct sun in cooler climates, but should be protected from intense, hot afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires constant moisture; substrate should always be wet, ideally with standing water at the base. High humidity is essential. Use distilled, rainwater, or deionized water to avoid mineral buildup. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sphagnum is a genus of approximately 380 accepted species of mosses, commonly known as sphagnum moss, also bog moss and quacker moss (although that term is also sometimes used for peat). Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16 to 26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions.
As Sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. Thus, Sphagnum can influence the composition of such habitats, with some describing Sphagnum as 'habitat manipulators' or 'autogenic ecosystem engineers'. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants.
Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions.
Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, and any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This peat moss thrives in consistently wet, acidic conditions mimicking its native bog habitat. Provide high humidity and diffuse light, ensuring the substrate never dries out. It requires minimal to no fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient requirements. Bogs are naturally nutrient-poor. Fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental. If used at all, apply a highly diluted, specialized acidic bog fertilizer very sparingly.
