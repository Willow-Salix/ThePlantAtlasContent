## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical mesic to wet forest home, requiring consistent soil moisture and well-drained conditions. Provide bright, indirect light or partial sun, avoiding intense afternoon exposure. Fertilize lightly during the growing season to support its moderate nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Use a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring/summer), reducing frequency in cooler months.
