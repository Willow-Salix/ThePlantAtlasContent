| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Montane Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers locations with ample direct sunlight for robust growth and abundant flowering, reflecting its open prairie and meadow habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. While tolerant of dry periods once established, it thrives with consistent moisture, especially during active growth. Ensure well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging, mimicking its native conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This aster prefers sunny locations with well-drained soil, tolerating drier conditions once established but performing best with consistent moisture. Provide minimal fertilization, aligning with its natural growth in prairies and meadows, for optimal health and flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once in spring is generally sufficient, particularly in poorer soils, as its native habitats are not typically nutrient-rich.
