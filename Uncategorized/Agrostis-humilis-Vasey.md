## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (including Sierra Nevada, Cascade Range, Rocky Mountains from California to Alaska and Montana) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (at least 6+ hours direct sunlight daily), thriving in open, high-altitude exposure. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial, especially during the short growing season, but excellent drainage is essential to prevent waterlogging, mimicking melting snowpack in well-drained, rocky soils. |

## Care Guide
Alpine bentgrass requires cool temperatures, full sun, and consistently moist, very well-drained, lean soils. It is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, therefore minimal fertilization is necessary, and good drainage is paramount to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, lean alpine soils; over-fertilization can be harmful.
