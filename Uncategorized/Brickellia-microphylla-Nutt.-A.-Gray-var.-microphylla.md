## Introduction
Brickellia is a North American genus of about 100 to 110 species of plants in the family Asteraceae, known commonly as brickellbushes. They are found in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central America.  Many species are native to the American southwest, especially Texas. Brickellia is among the more basal lineages of the Eupatorieae and should not be assigned to a subtribe pending further research.
They are mostly woody perennial shrubs. Some species have a very strong pleasant scent, while others smell distasteful. All contain high amounts of essential oils. Germacrene D, a natural insecticide, is found in B. veronicifolia and probably other species, if not all.
Despite their chemical defenses, brickellbushes are food for caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera. These include the noctuid moths Schinia trifascia, Schinia oleagina, which is known only from Brickellia, Schinia buta, which is only known from B. californica, and Schinia gracilenta, which is only known from B. eupatorioides.
The genus is named for John Brickell, 1748–1809, Irish-born physician and naturalist.

## Care Guide
As a native of arid scrublands, Littleleaf Brickellbush demands full sun and excellent drainage, tolerating dry conditions well. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils and generally does not require regular fertilization.
