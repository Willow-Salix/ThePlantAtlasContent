## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Rocky Mountains (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine to Alpine Tundra/Montane zones, characterized by cool summers, cold snowy winters, and often rocky, well-drained soils. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun in cooler climates or at higher altitudes; benefits from afternoon shade in warmer, lower-altitude regions. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist, but not waterlogged, soil. Thrives with good drainage, mimicking its rocky, alpine habitat. |

## Introduction
Polemonium, commonly called Jacob's ladders or Jacob's-ladders (the name derived from the Biblical story), is a genus of between 25 and 40 species of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae, native to cool temperate to arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. One species, Polemonium micranthum, also occurs in the southern Andes in South America. Many of the species grow at high altitudes, in mountainous areas. Most of the uncertainty in the number of species relates to those in Eurasia, many of which have been synonymized with Polemonium caeruleum.
Polemonium are perennial plants (rarely annual plants) growing 10–120 cm tall with bright green leaves divided into lance-shaped leaflets. They produce blue (rarely white or pink) flowers in the spring and summer.
Some species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora polemoniella.

## Care Guide
This alpine native thrives in cool, moist, well-drained conditions, reminiscent of its mountain habitat. Provide full sun in cooler climates or partial shade in warmer areas, ensuring the soil remains consistently moist but never waterlogged due to its preference for good drainage. It requires minimal fertilization, preferring lean to moderately rich soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced fertilizer or compost in early spring is sufficient, as it is adapted to leaner mountain soils.
