## Care Guide
Naked Buckwheat is a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant well-suited for full sun and well-drained conditions. Mimicking its native Mediterranean/arid environment, it requires infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilizer once established, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering. Minimal or no added nutrients are typically needed.
