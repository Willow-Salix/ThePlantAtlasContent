## 🧤 Care Instructions
This orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its native cloud forest. Provide bright indirect light, maintain consistent moisture with excellent drainage, and ensure high humidity. Regular application of a weak orchid fertilizer during active growth will support healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Weak, balanced orchid fertilizer applied frequently (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) during active growth, as nutrients are scarce for epiphytes in their natural habitat.
