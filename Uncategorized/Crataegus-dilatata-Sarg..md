## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
The Broadleaf Hawthorn thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-draining, moderately fertile soil. It requires consistent moisture, particularly during dry spells, but is adaptable once established. Minimal fertilization is typically needed unless soil quality is poor.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally sufficient with naturally rich soil. An application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial in poor soils or for promoting growth.
