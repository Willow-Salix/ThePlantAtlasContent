## Care Guide
This plant is adapted to cold, open environments, thriving in high sun exposure. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil to mimic its native conditions of frequent light precipitation and snowmelt. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor tundra soils, minimal to no fertilization is necessary.

### Fertilizer
Low. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as native tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor.
