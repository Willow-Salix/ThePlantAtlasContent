## Care Guide
Common Fumitory is an adaptable plant that thrives in full sun to partial shade in temperate environments. It prefers moderately moist, well-draining soil but is quite tolerant of average conditions. Mimicking its natural habitat in open, disturbed ground with minimal fertilization will ensure its success.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a common weed of cultivated and disturbed lands, it does not require rich soil and can thrive in average garden fertility without additional fertilization.
