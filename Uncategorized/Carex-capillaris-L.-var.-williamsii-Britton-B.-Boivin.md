| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subarctic Boreal |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. It thrives in open, exposed environments typical of its native high-latitude or high-altitude habitats. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil. Its natural habitat often involves moisture from snowmelt or frequent rainfall, but waterlogging should be avoided. |

## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This sedge flourishes in cool, alpine or subarctic conditions. Provide full to partial sun exposure and maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil. Fertilization should be minimal, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor native environments.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils found in alpine and subarctic environments, so minimal or no fertilization is generally required.
