## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central America (Costa Rica, Panama), Northern South America (Brazil, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela), and the Caribbean (Trinidad-Tobago). |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade, avoiding direct midday sun. It naturally grows in the filtered light of a dense forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, allowing the top inch to dry slightly between waterings. Mimics the frequent rainfall of its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Sagotia is a genus of plants under the family Euphorbiaceae first described as a genus in 1860. It is native to northern South America.

Species
Sagotia brachysepala (Müll.Arg.) Secco - French Guinea, Suriname, Guyana, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil
Sagotia racemosa Baill. - French Guinea, Suriname, Guyana, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil; possibly Panama + Costa Rica
Formerly included
moved to Morierina (Rubiaceae)

Sagotia gardenioides - Morierina montana (Rubiaceae)
Names in homonym genus
In 1851, Duchassaing & Walpers used the same generic name, Sagotia, to refer to a very different plant. Ordinarily, the rules of nomenclature mandate that the older name should be considered legitimate, while the newer one would need to be abandoned. In this case, however, the decision was made to conserve the newer name and reject the older one. Thus the one name in the older name was changed as follows:

Sagotia triflora (L.) Duchass. & Walp. - Desmodium triflorum (L.) DC.

## Care Guide
Sagotia triflora thrives in warm, highly humid environments with consistent moisture and bright, indirect light, mimicking its tropical rainforest origin. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging, and provide moderate fertilization during active growth for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding during the growing season (spring through summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, reflecting the quick nutrient cycling in rainforest ecosystems.
