## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America (primarily Canada, Alaska, and northern United States), often found in riparian zones like riverbanks and lake shores. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Boreal and Temperate Forest (characterized by cold winters, warm summers, and high moisture availability, often with seasonally wet soils). |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is ideal for optimal growth. While young trees can tolerate some partial shade, mature trees thrive in open, sunny exposures. |
| **💧 Water** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, reflecting its native habitats along water bodies. Do not allow soil to dry out completely, especially during active growth periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Populus balsamifera, commonly called balsam poplar, bam, bamtree, eastern balsam-poplar, hackmatack, tacamahac poplar, tacamahaca, is a tree species in the balsam poplar species group in the poplar genus, Populus. The genus name Populus is from the Latin for poplar, and the specific epithet balsamifera from Latin for "balsam-bearing".
Populus balsamifera is the northernmost North American hardwood, growing transcontinentally on boreal and montane upland and flood plain sites, and attaining its best development on flood plains. It is a hardy, fast-growing tree which is generally short lived, but some trees as old as 200 years have been found.
The tree is known for its strong, sweet fragrance, which emanates from its sticky, resinous buds. The smell has been compared to that of the balsam fir tree.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This very cold-hardy tree thrives in full sun and consistently moist, even wet, soil conditions, mirroring its native boreal and temperate riparian environments. It requires significant space due to its large size and fast growth, making it suitable for large landscapes with ample water.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer, particularly in its early years or if planted in less fertile soils. Thrives in naturally rich, alluvial soils.
