## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Inner North Coast Ranges of California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean montane woodlands and grasslands, often on serpentine soils, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to full sun. In its native habitat, it can be found in open, exposed areas or under the light canopy of montane woodlands. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil. Due to the dry summer climate of its native range, supplemental watering will be necessary during prolonged dry periods, especially in summer, to maintain soil moisture. |

## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
The Sonoma Sedge is a hardy plant that thrives in conditions mirroring its native Mediterranean montane environment. It adapts well to various light levels from partial to full sun and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, requiring supplemental water during dry summers. This species is tolerant of nutrient-poor soils, making fertilizer needs very low.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, including serpentine soils. Minimal to no fertilization is typically required; if used, apply a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly.
