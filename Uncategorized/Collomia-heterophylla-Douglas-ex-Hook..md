## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically from British Columbia south through Washington, Oregon, and California) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodlands and Mediterranean Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate full sun in cooler, coastal areas but often benefits from some afternoon shade in hotter inland climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Keep soil consistently moist during its active growth period in spring. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerates drier conditions once established or as it approaches dormancy. |

## Introduction
Collomia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. Species in the genus are known generally as trumpets, mountain trumpets, or trumpet flowers. They are native to North America and southern South America. The genus name comes from the Greek kolla ("glue"), a reference to the seeds, which become gelatinous in texture when wet.

## Care Guide
Variableleaf Collomia is an annual native to Western North America, thriving in temperate woodlands and Mediterranean climates. It prefers bright indirect light to partial sun and consistent moisture during its spring growth. Minimal fertilization is needed, making it a relatively low-maintenance option for native plant gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low. Generally not required if planted in reasonably fertile soil. A light, balanced liquid fertilizer applied once or twice during early spring growth may benefit plants in very poor soils.
