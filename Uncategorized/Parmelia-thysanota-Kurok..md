## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, moist, temperate forest environments with good air circulation. It needs indirect or filtered light and high humidity, absorbing moisture from the air and occasional rain. Avoid direct fertilization, as it is sensitive to external nutrients and pollutants.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air, rain, and substrate, and are highly sensitive to external fertilizers, which can be detrimental.
