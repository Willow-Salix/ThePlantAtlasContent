## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Florida (USA), Caribbean Islands (e.g., Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico), Central America (from Mexico south to Panama), and northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Moist Forest, often found in coastal hammocks, pine rocklands, and wet pinelands. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to full sun. In its native habitat, it can be found in the understory of forests or along edges, suggesting it tolerates some direct sun but benefits from protection during the hottest part of the day, especially in more intense climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular and consistent moisture. Reflecting its native wet forest and wetland habitats, the plant prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil and does not tolerate prolonged drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Picramnia, the bitterbushes, is a genus of flowering plants generally placed in the family Picramniaceae, but sometimes included in Simaroubaceae. The name is conserved against the genera Pseudo-brasilium Adans., and Tariri Aubl., both which have been rejected (nomen rejiciendum).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Florida Bitterbush thrives in warm, humid tropical to subtropical conditions with consistently moist, well-drained soil. It adapts to light ranging from partial shade to full sun and benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growth phase to support healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or a general-purpose liquid fertilizer applied during the growing season (spring and summer) would be sufficient, reflecting the nutrient cycling in its native forest environments.
