## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (including Alaska, Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains) and Eastern Asia (Siberia, Japan, Korea, China). |
| **Climate** | Subalpine and Alpine forests, meadows, and rocky slopes, characterized by cool temperatures, high humidity, and consistent moisture from snowmelt or rainfall. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial to full shade, mimicking its natural habitat under a tree canopy or in shaded crevices. Avoid direct, intense afternoon sun which can scorch its fronds. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, reflecting its native environment near streambanks and areas with snowmelt. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, but ensure good drainage. |

## Introduction
Athyrium (lady-fern) is a genus of about 180 species of terrestrial ferns, with a cosmopolitan distribution.  It is placed in the family Athyriaceae, in the order Polypodiales.
Its genus name is from Greek a- ('without') and Latinized Greek thyreos ('shield'), describing its inconspicuous indusium (sorus' covering).
The common name "lady fern" refers in particular to the common lady fern, Athyrium filix-femina.
Athyrium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the small angle shades and Sthenopis auratus.

## Care Guide
The Alpine Ladyfern thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded environments, mimicking its native subalpine habitat. Ensure the soil remains damp but not waterlogged, and protect it from direct sun exposure. A minimal amount of fertilizer will support its healthy growth during spring and summer.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. Apply a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring and early summer). Over-fertilization can harm the plant.
