## Care Guide
As a lichen, Roccella leucophaea requires high exposure to full sun and excellent air circulation, mimicking its native coastal rock habitats. It obtains moisture from the air via fog and mist rather than soil, necessitating high humidity or regular misting. No fertilization is needed as it absorbs nutrients directly from its environment.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air, dust, and rain. Sensitive to pollutants and excess soil nutrients.
