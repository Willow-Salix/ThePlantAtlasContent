## Introduction
Saccharum is a genus of tall perennial plants of the broomsedge tribe within the grass family.
The genus is widespread across tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions in Africa, Eurasia, Australia, the Americas, and assorted oceanic islands. Several species are cultivated and naturalized in areas outside their native habitats.
Saccharum includes the sugarcanes. They have stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are generally rich in sugar, and measure two to six m (6 to 19 ft) tall. All sugarcane species interbreed and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids.

## Care Guide
Plume Grass is a low-maintenance ornamental grass that thrives in full to partial sun. It prefers moderate watering during establishment but becomes drought tolerant. Minimal fertilization is needed, especially in rich soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none if planted in fertile soil.
