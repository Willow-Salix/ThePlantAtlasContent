## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, humid conditions with consistent moisture and low to moderate indirect light. It requires minimal nutrients, preferring damp, acidic substrates. Ensure high humidity to prevent drying out.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs. Fertilization is generally not required, or if used, apply a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once or twice a year).
