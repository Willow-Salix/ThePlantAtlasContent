## Care Guide
The Popcorn Cassia, originating from tropical East African grasslands, requires full sun and consistent moisture during its active growth phases, with reduced watering in cooler periods. It benefits from regular, balanced fertilization to support its vigorous growth and characteristic 'popcorn' scent.

### Fertilizer
Apply a balanced, general-purpose liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring through fall). Less frequent or no fertilization is needed during winter dormancy.
