| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia (e.g., Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines) and East Asia (e.g., Japan, Taiwan) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest / Subtropical Humid Forest (often montane) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to bright indirect light; accustomed to filtered sunlight under a forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is crucial. Requires consistently moist conditions through frequent misting or a humid environment, absorbing moisture from air and rain; avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Hypotrachyna is a genus of lichenized fungi within the family Parmeliaceae. According to the Dictionary of the Fungi (10th edition, 2008), the widespread genus contains about 198 species. Hypotrachyna was circumscribed by American lichenologist Mason Ellsworth Hale Jr in 1974.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in high humidity and bright indirect light, mimicking its native montane rainforest habitat. Ensure consistent moisture through misting or a humid environment, and avoid direct sun. No traditional fertilization is needed, as it absorbs nutrients from the air and water.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Lichens derive nutrients from the air and rainwater, making traditional fertilization unnecessary and potentially harmful.
