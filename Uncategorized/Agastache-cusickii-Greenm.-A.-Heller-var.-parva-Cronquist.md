## Introduction
Agastache () is a genus of aromatic flowering herbaceous perennial plants in the family Lamiaceae. It contains 22 species, mainly native to North America, one species native to eastern Asia. The common names of the species are a variety of fairly ambiguous and confusing "hyssops" and "mints"; as a whole the genus is known as giant hyssops or hummingbird mints.

## Care Guide
Cusick's Giant Hyssop var. parva thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization is rarely needed, making it a low-maintenance choice for temperate, semi-arid garden conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. Generally unnecessary in average garden soil, or a very light application in spring if soil is poor.
