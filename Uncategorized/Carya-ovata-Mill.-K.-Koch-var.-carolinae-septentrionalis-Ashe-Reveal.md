## Care Guide
This Carolina Shagbark Hickory thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate deciduous forest habitat. Provide full to partial sun and consistent moisture, particularly during its establishment phase. Once mature, it is a robust tree requiring minimal fertilization, adapting well to average forest soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization once established, as it thrives in average forest soils enriched by natural organic matter. Young trees may benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer.
