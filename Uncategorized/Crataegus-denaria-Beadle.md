## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
Beadle's Hawthorn flourishes in humid subtropical conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. It benefits from moderate fertilization in early spring but is generally hardy and low-maintenance once established, adapting to various soil types.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula in early spring. Native forest soils are not excessively rich, so heavy feeding is unnecessary.
