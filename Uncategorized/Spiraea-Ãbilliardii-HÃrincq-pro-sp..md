## Introduction
Spiraea , sometimes spelled spirea in common names, and commonly known as meadowsweets or steeplebushes, is a genus of about 80 to 100 species of shrubs in the family Rosaceae. They are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest diversity in eastern Asia.
The genus formerly included the herbaceous species now segregated into the genera Filipendula and Aruncus; recent genetic evidence has shown that Filipendula is only distantly related to Spiraea, belonging in the subfamily Rosoideae.

## Care Guide
This adaptable hybrid thrives in full sun with consistently moist, well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering and generally low fertilization, making it a relatively low-maintenance shrub suitable for temperate garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, particularly in poor soils.
