## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including parts of Canada (British Columbia, Alberta) and the western United States (e.g., Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, California). |
| **Climate** | Temperate riparian zones within montane forests, canyons, or subalpine regions, characterized by cool, moist soils near perennial water sources like streams and rivers. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers full sun where soil moisture is abundant and consistent, tolerating partial shade in hotter climates to reduce water stress. |
| **Watering** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, mimicking its natural habitat along stream banks. Does not tolerate drought and will suffer if soil dries out. |

## Introduction
Betula occidentalis, the water birch or red birch, is a species of birch native to western North America, in Canada from Yukon east to Northwestern Ontario and southwards, and in the United States from eastern Washington east to western North Dakota, and south to eastern California, northern Arizona and northern New Mexico, and southwestern Alaska. It typically occurs along streams in mountainous regions, sometimes at elevations of 2,100 metres (6,900 feet) and in drier areas than paper birch.

It is a deciduous shrub or small tree growing to 14 m (46 ft) high, up to 25 centimetres (10 inches) thick. It tends toward epicormic growth, with many small limbs sprouting from the trunk and causing the wood to be full of small knots. The bark is dark red-brown to blackish, and smooth but not exfoliating. The twigs are glabrous or thinly hairy, and odorless when scraped. The leaves are alternate, ovate to rhombic, 1–7 cm (1⁄2–2+3⁄4 in) long and 1–4.5 cm (1⁄2–1+3⁄4 in) broad, with a serrated margin and two to six pairs of veins, and a short petiole up to 1.5 cm (1⁄2 in) long. The flowers are wind-pollinated catkins 2–4 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄2 in) long, the male catkins pendulous, the female catkins erect. The fruit is 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄4 in) long and 8–15 millimetres (1⁄4–1⁄2 in) broad, composed of numerous tiny winged seeds packed between the catkin bracts.
The identity of similar birches in Alaska is disputed; some include them in B. occidentalis, while others regard them as hybrids between Betula neoalaskana and Betula glandulosa.  A 2023 study sequenced chloroplast genomes of species from the genus Betula for phylogenetic analysis. Of the Betula species, B. occidentalis was most closely related to B. pendula purple rain and B. platyphylla.
The foliage is browsed by sheep, goats, and birds; some small birds also consume the seeds.
Some Plateau Indian tribes used water birch to treat pimples and sores.

It is also a riverside tree found in western USA that reacts to water stress by becoming isohydric.

## Care Guide
The Water Birch thrives in its native environment of consistently moist to wet soils along stream banks in western North America. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure high water availability, particularly during warm periods, to mimic its riparian habitat. It prefers average soil fertility and does not tolerate drought.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; thrives in average soil fertility often found in riparian areas. An annual application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring can support vigorous growth.
