## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America (including Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Highlands / Semi-Arid Montane Scrublands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers bright, direct light for best growth and flowering, similar to its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water thoroughly when the soil is completely dry to the touch, then allow it to dry out again before the next watering. Reduce frequency significantly in cooler months. |

## Introduction
Furcraea is a  genus of succulent plants belonging to the family Asparagaceae, native to tropical regions of Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and northern South America. Some species are also naturalized in parts of Africa, the United States (Florida), Portugal, Thailand, India, and Australia, as well as on various oceanic islands. Plants of this genus are the origin of fique or cabuyo, a natural fiber.

## Care Guide
Furcraea thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native tropical and subtropical highland environments. It is highly drought-tolerant, necessitating infrequent watering where the soil fully dries between applications. Fertilize sparingly only during the active growing season to support robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring and summer). Over-fertilization should be avoided, as they are adapted to nutrient-poor soils.
