## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate forest floor: low light, consistently moist substrate, and very high ambient humidity. Avoid direct sunlight and over-fertilization, as these can be detrimental. Creating a humid microclimate is key to its successful cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is needed; if used, apply a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once or twice a year).
