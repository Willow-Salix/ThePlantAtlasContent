## Care Guide
Pin Cherry is a resilient pioneer species from Northern Temperate and Boreal Forests, needing full to partial sun. Provide moderate, consistent watering, particularly during establishment, and avoid heavy fertilization. It's well-suited to various soils and is relatively low-maintenance once mature.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally does not require extensive fertilization, as it is adapted to colonizing disturbed or less nutrient-rich soils typical of pioneer species.
