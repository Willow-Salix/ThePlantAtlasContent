| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Grasslands (Pampas) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open grassland native habitat. |

## Introduction
This is about the Verbena bonariensis described by Linnaeus. See also below for a common misapplication of this taxon.

Verbena bonariensis, the purpletop vervain, clustertop vervain, Argentinian vervain, tall verbena  or pretty verbena, is a member of the verbena family cultivated as a flowering annual or herbaceous perennial plant. In United States horticulture, it is also known by the ambiguous names purpletop (also used for the grass Tridens flavus) and South American vervain (which can mean any of the numerous species in the genus Verbena occurring in that continent). For the misapplication "Brazilian verbena" see below.
It is native to tropical South America where it grows throughout most of the warm regions, from Colombia and Brazil to Argentina and Chile.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native grassland habitat. Provide regular watering, but allow the soil to dry slightly between sessions, as it is quite drought tolerant once established. Fertilize sparingly to prevent excessive leafy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in average to poor soils. Over-fertilizing can lead to leggy growth, mirroring the typical nutrient availability in grassland soils.
