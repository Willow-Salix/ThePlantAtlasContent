## Introduction
Charpentiera is a flowering plant genus in the family Amaranthaceae.  It consists of five species endemic to Hawaiʻi, where they are known as pāpala, and one species found only on the island of Tubuai in the Austral Islands. All species are trees, some reaching more than 10 metres (33 ft) in height. The genus is named for Arsène Charpentier (1781-1818), professor of pharmacy at Antwerp from 1810 to 1814 and at Cherbourg from 1814 to 1816.

Provide it with bright, indirect light and consistently moist soil, ensuring it never dries out completely. A moderate, balanced fertilizer applied during its active growth period will support healthy development.
