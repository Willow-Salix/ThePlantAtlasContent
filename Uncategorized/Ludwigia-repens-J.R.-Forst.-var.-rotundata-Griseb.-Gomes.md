## Care Guide
This aquatic plant thrives in bright to very bright light to achieve its characteristic red hues and must be kept fully submerged or in constantly saturated soil. It requires a good supply of nutrients, particularly iron, to support healthy growth and vibrant coloration, often benefiting from both substrate and water column fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high nutrient requirements; benefits from nutrient-rich substrate and regular liquid fertilization in the water column, especially iron for red pigmentation.
