## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Europe, North Africa, and Western to Central Asia |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Open Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open, exposed areas, but can tolerate some dappled shade. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings; it is highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its native habitat in often dry, well-drained soils. |

## Introduction
Brachypodium sylvaticum, commonly known as false-brome, slender false brome or wood false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia and Africa. Its native range includes most of Europe, northwestern Africa, Sudan and Eritrea, Western and Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, China, Korea, Japan, Malesia, and New Guinea.
The bunchgrass is most commonly found in forests and woodlands, preferring the shaded canopy, but may grow in open areas. It prefers well drained neutral and calcerous soils, and avoids wet conditions.

## Care Guide
This resilient temperate grass prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soils. It requires low to moderate watering, exhibiting excellent drought tolerance once established, and has minimal fertilizer needs. Its adaptability to various conditions makes it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low. This grass naturally grows in poor to moderately fertile soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth appears weak.
