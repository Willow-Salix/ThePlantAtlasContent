## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Common Woolly Sunflower thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean scrubland and dry grassland environments. Once established, it is remarkably drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering and generally no fertilizer, making it an ideal low-maintenance plant for xeric landscapes. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Its native habitats often feature lean, well-draining soils, so it generally does not require fertilization and can tolerate poor to average soil conditions.
