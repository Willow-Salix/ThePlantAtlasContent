## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Europe, particularly the Black Sea region (e.g., Ukraine, Russia), extending into parts of Central and Southern Europe. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Continental/Steppe Climate. Characterized by cold winters, warm to hot, often dry summers, and moderate seasonal precipitation. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. This plant thrives in open, exposed locations, reflecting its native habitat in grasslands and disturbed sites. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. It prefers well-drained soil and can tolerate periods of drought once established, indicative of its natural dry grassland environment. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings. |

## Introduction
Cerastium is a genus of annual, winter annual, or perennial flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. They are commonly called mouse-ears or mouse-ear chickweeds. There are 214 accepted species, found nearly worldwide but with the greatest concentration in the northern temperate regions. A number of the species are common weeds in fields and on disturbed ground.

Cerastium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora chalcogrammella (which feeds exclusively on Cerastium arvense) and Coleophora striatipennella (which has been recorded on Cerastium fontanum).

## Care Guide
This mouse-ear chickweed prefers full sun and well-drained soil, tolerating moderate drought once established. It thrives in average soil fertility and requires minimal fertilization to prevent leggy growth. Its hardy nature makes it relatively low-maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Native to average or even poor, often calcareous soils, this plant does not require rich fertilization. Excessive nutrients can lead to weak, leggy growth.
