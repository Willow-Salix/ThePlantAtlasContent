## Care Guide
The Ouricury palm, native to the semi-arid dry forests of northeastern Brazil, thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering with ample drying periods between sessions. Fertilization should be minimal, utilizing a slow-release palm formula only during its active growing season.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; use a slow-release palm fertilizer sparingly during the active growing season.
