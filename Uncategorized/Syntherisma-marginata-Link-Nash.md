## Introduction
Digitaria is a genus of plants in the grass family native to tropical and warm temperate regions but can occur in tropical, subtropical, and cooler temperate regions as well. Common names include crabgrass, finger-grass, and fonio. They are slender monocotyledonous annual and perennial lawn, pasture, and forage plants; some are often considered lawn pests. Digitus is the Latin word for "finger", and they are distinguished by the long, finger-like inflorescences they produce.

## Care Guide
As a widely distributed grass native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in full sun and warm temperatures. It prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil but demonstrates high drought tolerance once established. Its robust nature means it tolerates various soil types and moderate fertility, often growing vigorously without extensive care.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adaptable to various soil types, including poor soils. Benefits from general-purpose fertilizer for vigorous growth, but not strictly required given its robust nature.
