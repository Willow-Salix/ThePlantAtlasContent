## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This hybrid sedge thrives in consistently wet to saturated soil conditions, typical of its native eastern Canadian wetlands. It prefers full to partial sun exposure and will benefit from light, occasional fertilization during active growth to maintain vigor. Ensure a constantly moist environment to mimic its natural habitat.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate. Benefits from occasional balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season, but is not typically a heavy feeder.
