## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (specifically Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and parts of California within the Mojave Desert region) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive and flower profusely) |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and deep watering. This plant is highly drought-tolerant once established; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering is detrimental. |

## Introduction
Encelia is a genus of the plant family Asteraceae whose members are frequently called brittlebushes. It consists of shrubs (and one geophyte) of arid environments in southwestern North America and western South America.
All have n = 18 chromosomes. All the North American species are obligate outcrossers. In cultivation, the species readily form fertile F1 hybrids, F2s, and backcrosses, but in natural areas of sympatry, F2s and backcrosses are absent or rare.
Encelia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the leaf miner Bucculatrix enceliae which feeds exclusively on Encelia farinosa.
The phylogenetic sister group of Encelia is a clade comprising the genera Enceliopsis and Geraea. The three genera are informally called the "Encelia alliance".
Encelia is named in honor of German biologist Christophorus Enzelius, 1517–1583.

## Care Guide
Virgin River Brittlebush is a resilient desert plant that thrives on neglect. Provide it with full, intense sun, extremely well-draining soil, and water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry completely between deep waterings. Avoid excessive fertilization to maintain its natural, hardy growth habit.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. It is adapted to lean desert soils and generally does not require fertilization. If desired, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in early spring.
