## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Asia (Japan, Taiwan) |
| **Climate** | Sub-alpine/Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light with tolerance for some direct morning or late afternoon sun; needs protection from intense midday sun to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and frequent moisture from mist or rain. As a lichen, it absorbs water directly from the air; avoid standing water or waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
Sasak's Snow Lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light, mimicking its native sub-alpine habitat. Provide consistent moisture through frequent misting or high ambient humidity, and avoid any direct fertilization due to its sensitivity to nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilization and is highly sensitive to high nutrient concentrations; receives trace nutrients from the air and precipitation.
