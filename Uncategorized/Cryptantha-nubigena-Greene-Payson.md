## Introduction
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## Care Guide
This hardy alpine plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soil. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, allowing periods of dryness. Avoid rich soils and heavy fertilization to mimic its natural montane habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. If needed, a very dilute, balanced slow-release fertilizer once in spring for potted plants. Avoid rich soils.
