## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central United States, extending into Southern Canada |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Open Woodland Edges |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and prolific flowering. Can tolerate very light partial shade but may have fewer blooms. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is needed, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reflecting its drought-tolerant nature once established, avoid overwatering and ensure excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## Care Guide
Rose Verbena thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native environment in open prairies and forest edges. This plant is drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering and minimal fertilization to ensure abundant, continuous blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is generally sufficient, or none at all if soil is adequately rich. Over-fertilization can hinder flowering.
