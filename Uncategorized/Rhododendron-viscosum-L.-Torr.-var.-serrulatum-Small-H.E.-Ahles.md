## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Coastal Plains from North Carolina to Florida and west to Mississippi) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Wetlands/Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial shade, especially protection from intense afternoon sun, but can tolerate full sun if the soil is kept consistently wet. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil, replicating its native swamp and bog environments. Needs frequent watering to prevent drying out, particularly during dry spells or in full sun. |

## Introduction
Rhododendron (; pl.: rhododendra), from Ancient Greek ῥόδον (rhódon), meaning "rose", and δένδρον (déndron), meaning "tree", is a very large genus of about 1,024 species of woody plants in the heath family (Ericaceae). They can be either evergreen or deciduous. Most species are native to eastern Asia and the Himalayan region, but smaller numbers occur elsewhere in Asia, and in North America, Europe and Australia.
It is the national flower of Nepal, the state flower of Washington and West Virginia in the United States, the state flower of Nagaland and Himachal Pradesh in India, the provincial flower of Jeju Province in South Korea, the provincial flower of Jiangxi in China and the state tree of Sikkim and Uttarakhand in India. Most species have brightly coloured flowers which bloom from late winter through to early summer.
Azaleas make up two subgenera of Rhododendron. They are distinguished from "true" rhododendrons by having only five anthers per flower.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in consistently wet, acidic soil and prefers partial shade, though it can tolerate full sun if well-watered. Mimic its swampy native habitat by ensuring high humidity and frequent watering, and fertilize with an acid-forming product.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from an acid-forming fertilizer formulated for azaleas and rhododendrons, applied in spring after flowering. Native soils are often rich in organic matter but acidic.
