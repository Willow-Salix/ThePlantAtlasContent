## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Asia and Southeast Asia (including China, Japan, Korea, India, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia) extending to parts of Northern Australia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Wetland and Moist Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial sun exposure, reflecting its open wetland and grassland habitats. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to saturated soil conditions, ideally mimicking its native swamp, rice field, and stream bank environments. It tolerates waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## Care Guide
This wetland sedge thrives in full to partial sun with consistently wet, even saturated, soil conditions. It is adapted to low nutrient environments, requiring only minimal fertilization for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a wetland sedge, it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and does not require heavy feeding.
