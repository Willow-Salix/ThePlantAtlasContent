## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Dry Pine Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its natural habitat in open fields and prairies. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water moderately until roots are developed, then allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Chrysopsis (golden asters) are plants in the family Asteraceae native to the southern and eastern United States. All the species are found in Florida, although some are found in other states as well.
These are annual and perennial herbs bearing daisy-like flower heads with yellow disc florets and usually yellow ray florets. Some species formerly classified in this genus are now included in other genera: Heterotheca, Pityopsis, Stenotus, Ionactis, Aster, Eucephalus, Erigeron, Machaeranthera, Croptilon, Xanthisma, Oclemena, Bradburia, Oxypappus, Arnica, and Helichrysopsis.
Golden asters are often used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Schinia petulans (which feeds exclusively on C. subulata).

## Care Guide
This robust perennial thrives in full sun and well-drained to sandy soil, characteristic of its native open grasslands. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering, and performs best with minimal fertilization. Ensure ample sunlight and good drainage for optimal growth and abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; native soils are often poor to average. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, or none at all if soil is healthy.
