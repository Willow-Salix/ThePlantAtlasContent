## 🌱 Overview
Thelocarpon is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Thelocarpaceae. The genus was established in 1853 by the Finnish lichenologist William Nylander, who distinguished it from related genera by its warted thallus structure, many-spored asci, and the distinctive violet-blue staining reaction of its fruiting body gel when treated with iodine. These tiny lichens form small, wart-like bumps on soil, wood, and plant debris, often covered with a distinctive bright yellow powdery coating. The genus includes about 30 species found worldwide, many of which produce unusually large numbers of ascospores—sometimes over 300 per spore sac.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This unique dung-dwelling lichen requires a highly specific substrate of old herbivore dung, rich in nitrogen and organic matter. It flourishes in moderate to high light conditions, experiencing intermittent moisture with ample time to dry out between wetting events.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives on nutrient-rich substrates, specifically herbivore dung, indicating a strong preference for high nitrogen and organic matter content.
