| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Trans-Pecos region of Texas, USA |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland (Chihuahuan Desert) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic arid desert rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Paronychia is an inflammation of the skin around the nail, often due to bacteria or fungi.  
Its sudden (acute) occurrence is usually due to the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Gradual (chronic) occurrences are typically caused by fungi, commonly Candida albicans. 
Risk factors for paronychia include frequent hand washing and trauma to the cuticle, such as from chronic nail biting or hangnails.
Treatment typically involves antibiotics for bacterial infections and antifungals for fungal infections. If there is pus formation, incision and drainage may be necessary.
Paronychia is commonly mistakenly used interchangeably with herpetic whitlow or felon, which are distinct conditions.

## Care Guide
Jones' Nailwort is a desert-adapted plant that thrives in full sun conditions. It requires very infrequent watering, allowing its well-drained soil to dry out completely between waterings. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, consistent with its native nutrient-poor, rocky habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal; its native gypseous and limestone soils are typically nutrient-poor, so excessive fertilization is not recommended.
