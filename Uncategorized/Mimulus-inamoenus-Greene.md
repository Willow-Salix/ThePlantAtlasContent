## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
The Harlequin Monkeyflower thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native riparian habitats. It prefers partial sun, especially in warmer climates, and has modest nutrient needs, typically requiring minimal fertilization. Ensure it never dries out to promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season, but is often not essential.
