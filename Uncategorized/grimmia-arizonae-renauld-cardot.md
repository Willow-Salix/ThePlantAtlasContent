## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient moss requires bright light and thrives on an infrequent watering schedule, allowing its substrate to dry completely between waterings. Avoid excessive fertilization, as it is adapted to low-nutrient, rocky environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed; excessive nutrients can be detrimental to its growth.
