## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern Arizona (Pinaleño Mountains/Mt. Graham) and adjacent New Mexico, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane Forest/Woodland (Sky Island Ecosystem) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to light partial shade, preferring full sun for best flowering, especially at higher altitudes or in cooler climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring less water in winter. |

## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mt. Graham Beardtongue thrives in full sun with excellent drainage, mimicking its native rocky mountain slopes. Provide moderate watering during its active growing season, ensuring the soil dries completely between applications, and reduce watering significantly in winter. Fertilization is rarely necessary, as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. These plants are adapted to lean, rocky soils; heavy fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced blooms. A light, balanced fertilizer in early spring can be applied if growth is poor.
