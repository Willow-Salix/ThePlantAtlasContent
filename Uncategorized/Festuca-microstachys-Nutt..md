## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (primarily California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, British Columbia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Mediterranean Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires infrequent deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## Care Guide
This fescue thrives in sunny to partly shaded locations with well-draining soil, mimicking its native dry grasslands. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry gardens. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Fertilize sparingly in spring with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer, or skip entirely in rich soils.
