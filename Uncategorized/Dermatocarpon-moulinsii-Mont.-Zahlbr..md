## Introduction
Dermatocarpon is a genus of lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. Members of the genus are commonly called stippleback lichens because they have fruiting structures called perithecia that are flask-shaped structures embedded in the nonfruiting body (thallus), with a hole in the top to release spores, causing an appearance of being covered with small black dots. Its species are told apart chiefly by spore size, the colour and texture of the lower surface, and whether the epinecral layer gives a pruinose bloom.

## Care Guide
Moulins' silverskin lichen thrives in cool, humid conditions with low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native montane habitat. Ensure high atmospheric humidity and consistent moisture, as it naturally absorbs nutrients from the environment.

### Fertilizer
Not necessary; lichens acquire nutrients from air and precipitation.
