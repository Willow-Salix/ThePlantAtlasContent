## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern North America (Great Plains, Midwest, Eastern Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and flowering, mirroring its open prairie habitat. |
| **Watering** | Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to periods of dry weather in its native prairies; avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Erysimum, or wallflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the cabbage family, Brassicaceae. It includes more than 150 species, both popular garden plants and many wild forms. Erysimum is characterised by star-shaped (and/or two-sided) trichomes growing from the stem, with yellow, red, pink or orange flowers and multiseeded seed pods.

## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun and well-drained soil, the Small-flower Prairie Wallflower requires moderate watering, becoming drought-tolerant once established. Mimicking its prairie origins, it generally needs low to moderate fertilization to prevent excessive foliage at the expense of blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial, but over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth rather than more flowers.
