## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Silky Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soil, requiring minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Water moderately during its active growth period, then reduce frequency as it establishes drought tolerance.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, especially nitrogen. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.
