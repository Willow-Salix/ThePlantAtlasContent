## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, Washington) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Semi-Arid Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering when actively growing, allowing soil to dry out between sessions. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, adapting to the seasonal rainfall patterns of its native habitat. |

## Care Guide
This hybrid grass, native to the open temperate grasslands of Western North America, thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering during active growth, becoming quite drought-tolerant once established, and generally benefits from minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native to diverse grassland soils, it generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary.
