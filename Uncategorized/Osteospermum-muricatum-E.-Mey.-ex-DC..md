## Care Guide
Originating from the Mediterranean Shrubland and Arid Grasslands of South Africa, this African Daisy thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established. It requires well-drained soil and minimal fertilization, preferring infrequent, deep watering once the soil has dried out.

### Fertilizer
Requires low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is generally sufficient. Avoid over-fertilizing as this can lead to leggy growth and fewer blooms.
