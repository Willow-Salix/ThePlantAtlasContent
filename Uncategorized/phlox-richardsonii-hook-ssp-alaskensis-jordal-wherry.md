## 🧤 Care Instructions
To mimic its native Arctic Tundra environment, Alaskan Phlox requires full sun and well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Water moderately during its short growing season, letting the soil dry out between applications, and apply fertilizer sparingly as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to minimal. Native tundra soils are typically poor in nutrients, so heavy fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental.
