## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Africa (Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda) and the Arabian Peninsula (Yemen, Saudi Arabia) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland to Semi-Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires intense, direct sunlight for optimal growth and flowering, mimicking its native open, unshaded habitats. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent; extremely drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during active growth. Reduce significantly or withhold water during cooler, dormant periods to prevent rot. |

## Introduction
Edithcolea is a monotypic genus with a single species Edithcolea grandis (Persian carpet flower). Once classified in the family Asclepiadaceae, it is now in the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family Apocynaceae. It is native to eastern Africa and to the Arabian Peninsula.
The genus is named after Edith Cole (1859–1940). She collected the type material for this plant with Lort Philips in 1895, during a botanical expedition (1894–1895) led by Ethelbert Edward Lort Phillips (1857-1944) from Berbera to the Golis mountains in Somaliland.

## Care Guide
The Persian Carpet Flower is a desert succulent requiring full, intense sunlight and extremely infrequent watering to prevent rot, especially during dormancy. It thrives in well-draining soil with minimal nutrient input, reflecting its arid native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low; native soils are typically poor. Fertilize very sparingly (e.g., once or twice during the growing season with a diluted low-nitrogen succulent fertilizer) or not at all if repotted annually.
