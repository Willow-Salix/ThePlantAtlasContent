## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, parts of Southeast Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Woodlands and Heathlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open, exposed conditions, reflecting its habitat in woodlands and heathlands. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. As many species are drought-tolerant, infrequent deep watering is sufficient once established, especially during dry periods. Requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Exocarpos (from Ancient Greek ἔξω (éxō), meaning "outside", and καρπός (karpós), meaning "fruit", and thus, "outside fruit"), also known as ballart, is a genus of flowering shrubs and small trees in the sandalwood family, Santalaceae. They are found throughout Southeast Asia, Australia and the Pacific Islands.
They are semi-parasitic, requiring the roots of a host tree, a trait they share with many other members of the Santalaceae.
In Australia, some species are also known as ballarts or cherries.

The genus Exocarpos was first described by Jacques Labillardière on 7 May 1792:I discovered an evergreen tree, which has its nut situated, like that of the acajou, upon a fleshy receptacle much larger than itself. I therefore named this new genus exocarpos. . . . The principal characters of this plant have led me to rank it among the terebinthinaceous tribe, next to the anacardium. I have given it the name of exocarpos cupressiformis.Convention dictates that the taxon is often expressed as Exocarpos Labill. 1798.
Within Australia, an identification key is available for New South Wales species, and for Victorian species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Exocarpos species are generally hardy, low-maintenance plants preferring full sun and well-drained soil. They are drought-tolerant once established and require minimal, low-phosphorus fertilization to thrive.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Native soils are often nutrient-poor. If fertilization is necessary, use a low-phosphorus formula sparingly, typically designed for Australian native plants.
