## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily Mojave Desert regions of California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah) and northern Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Arid Desert / Desert Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun, meaning at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. It thrives in intense, unfiltered light. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply only when the soil has completely dried out. In winter or during dormant periods, watering should be significantly reduced or stopped entirely. |

## Introduction
Opuntia, commonly called the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family Cactaceae, many known for their flavorful fruit and showy flowers. Cacti are native to the Americas, and are well adapted to arid climates; however, they are still vulnerable to alterations in precipitation and temperature driven by climate change. The plant has been introduced to Australia, southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.
Prickly pear alone is also used to refer to the fruit, but may also be used for the plant itself; in addition, other names given to the plant and its specific parts include tuna (fruit), sabra, sabbar, nopal (pads, plural nopales, from the Nahuatl word nōpalli), nostle (fruit) from the Nahuatl word nōchtli, and paddle cactus. The genus is named for the Ancient Greek city of Opus. The fruit and leaves are edible. The most common culinary species is the "Barbary fig" (Opuntia ficus-indica).
In places where they have been introduced outside their native range, some species in the genus Opuntia behave as aggressive invasive species.

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. Fertilize minimally during the growing season with a specialized cactus formula. Mimicking its arid native climate is key to its successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. If desired, apply a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer). Over-fertilization can harm the plant.
