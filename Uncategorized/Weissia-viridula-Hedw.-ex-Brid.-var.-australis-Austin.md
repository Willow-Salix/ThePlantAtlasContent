## Care Guide
This widely distributed moss thrives in consistently moist, humid conditions with partial to indirect light. It requires very little fertilization and is tolerant of occasional drying, quickly rehydrating with moisture.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses absorb nutrients from water, dust, and decaying organic matter. A highly diluted (e.g., 1/10 strength) balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly, or none at all.
