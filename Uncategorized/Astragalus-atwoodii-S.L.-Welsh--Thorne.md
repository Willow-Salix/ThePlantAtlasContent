## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native arid scrubland habitat in Utah. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly, and avoid over-fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements, as it is a legume that fixes nitrogen. If necessary, a very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied in spring.
