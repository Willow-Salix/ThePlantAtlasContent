## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Australia |
| **Climate** | Tropical Savanna/Monsoon Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers full exposure as found in open grasslands and woodlands. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established due to adaptation to dry seasons, but thrives with moderate, consistent watering during its active growing period (wet season). Requires well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Urochloa,  commonly known as signalgrass, is a genus of plants in the grass family, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Eurasia, Africa, Australia, the Americas, and various islands. 
Several species of the genus Urochloa are cultivated as forage and some species of  were probably first introduced unintentionally to the Americas in the colonial period, from slave ships.

## Care Guide
Wiry Grass is a resilient plant that thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is highly tolerant of drought once established. It benefits from moderate watering during its active growth and prefers well-draining soil with low to moderate fertility. Overall, it requires minimal care, reflecting its hardy nature in Australian savannas.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility; can tolerate poor soils but benefits from light application of a balanced fertilizer during the growing season.
