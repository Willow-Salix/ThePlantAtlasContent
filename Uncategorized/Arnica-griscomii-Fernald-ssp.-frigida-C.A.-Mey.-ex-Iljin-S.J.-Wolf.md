## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions across North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Greenland) and Eurasia (e.g., Siberia). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6+ hours of direct sun daily) to very bright indirect light, mimicking open, treeless tundra exposure. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Watering frequency should be moderate, allowing the top soil to dry slightly between waterings, similar to meltwater availability in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Arnica angustifolia is an Arctic and alpine species of plants in the sunflower family, known by the common names narrowleaf arnica and Arctic arnica. It is native to colder regions in Europe, Asia, and North America (northern and western Canada, Alaska, northern Rocky Mountains). It is a perennial herb growing up to 16 inches (41 centimetres) tall. Its native habitats include bare, rocky slopes and alpine summits.

## Care Guide
This cold-hardy alpine perennial thrives in full sun and well-drained, consistently moist soil, mimicking its native arctic tundra environment. It requires minimal fertilization and tolerates cold temperatures, needing a period of dormancy to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor. Apply a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once annually in early spring, or generally none at all if planted in a suitable medium.
