## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | British Columbia, Canada |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers high light exposure typical of open alpine environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; thrives in consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during the growing season. Tolerant of some drought once established, but avoid prolonged dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fescue is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils. Provide moderate watering to keep the soil consistently moist during its active growth, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Fertilization is rarely needed, as it prefers nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; prefers lean soils. High fertility can be detrimental. If necessary, a very light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring.
