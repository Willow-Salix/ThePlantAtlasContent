## Introduction
Achillea  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The plants typically have frilly leaves and are known colloquially as yarrows, although this common name usually refers to A. millefolium. The genus was named after the Greek mythological character Achilles, whose soldiers were said to have used yarrow to treat their wounds; this is reflected by common names such as allheal and bloodwort. The genus is native primarily to Eurasia and North America.

## Care Guide
Boreal Yarrow is a robust plant that requires full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native open and often rocky northern habitats. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and keep fertilization minimal as it's adapted to less nutrient-rich conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; this plant thrives in lean to average soils and typically does not require much, if any, supplemental fertilizer. Over-fertilizing can lead to leggy growth.
