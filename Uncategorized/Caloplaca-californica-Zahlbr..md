## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pacific Coast of North America, primarily California and Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Coastal Scrubland / Rocky Shoreline |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright indirect light. It thrives in exposed, coastal environments with high light intensity. |
| **Watering** | Lichens absorb moisture directly from the air, fog, and rain. Mimic its natural environment with high ambient humidity or regular misting, allowing for periods of complete dryness. Avoid prolonged saturation. |

## Introduction
Caloplaca is a lichen genus comprising a number of distinct species. Members of the genus are commonly called firedot lichen, jewel lichen. gold lichens, "orange lichens", but they are not always orange, as in the case of C. albovariegata. The distribution of this lichen genus is worldwide, extending from Antarctica to the high Arctic. It includes a portion of northern North America and the Russian High Arctic. There are about thirty species of Caloplaca in the flora of the British Isles.
A new species of Caloplaca, C. obamae, the first species to be named in honor of Barack Obama, was discovered in 2007 on Santa Rosa Island in California and published in March 2009.

## Care Guide
The California orange lichen thrives in high light, mimicking its coastal full-sun habitat. Provide high ambient humidity or regular misting, allowing for dry periods, as it absorbs moisture from the air rather than soil. Traditional fertilizers are unnecessary and potentially harmful for this lichen.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens do not require traditional fertilizers and can be harmed by them, as they absorb trace elements from the atmosphere and rainwater.
