## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and northern Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) to thrive, reflecting its native open, sunny habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. More frequent watering may be needed during prolonged dry spells or extreme heat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Mimosa is a genus of about 600 species of herbs and shrubs, in the mimosoid clade of the legume family Fabaceae. Species are native to the Americas, from North Dakota to northern Argentina, and to eastern Africa (Tanzania, Mozambique, and Madagascar) as well as the Indian subcontinent and Indochina. The generic name is derived from the Greek word μῖμος (mimos), 'actor' or 'mime', and the feminine suffix -osa, 'resembling', suggesting its 'sensitive leaves' which seem to 'mimic conscious life'.
Two species in the genus are especially notable. One is Mimosa pudica, commonly known as touch-me-not, which folds its leaves when touched or exposed to heat. It is native to southern Central and South America but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value, both as a houseplant in temperate areas, and outdoors in the tropics. Outdoor cultivation has led to weedy invasion in some areas, notably Hawaii. The other is Mimosa tenuiflora, which is best known for its use in shamanic ayahuasca brews due to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine found in its root bark.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted shrub thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering once established due to its native arid environment. It prefers well-draining, even poor soils and generally does not need significant fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may benefit young plants, but is generally unnecessary for mature, established plants.
