## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in high humidity and low, indirect light conditions, characteristic of its native humid forest habitats. It requires frequent misting to absorb moisture and does not need traditional fertilization, deriving nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain necessary trace nutrients from rain, air, and the substrate on which they grow.
