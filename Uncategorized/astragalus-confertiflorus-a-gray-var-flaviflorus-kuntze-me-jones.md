## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and dry conditions, characteristic of its native arid scrubland and desert habitats. It requires minimal water once established and is highly drought-tolerant, making overwatering a significant risk. Fertilizer needs are very low, reflecting its adaptation to poor soils.
