## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pilose Vetch thrives in full sun to partial shade, adapting well to temperate steppe climates with moderate rainfall. It requires moderate watering, especially during active growth, and minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. This plant is relatively low-maintenance, ideal for improving soil health in suitable climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally does not require supplemental nitrogen. A low-nitrogen, balanced fertilizer can be applied if soil is exceptionally poor in other nutrients.
