| **Native Origin** | California, USA (specifically Inner North Coast Ranges and San Francisco Bay Area) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers open, bright conditions, typical of its grassland and foothill habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growing season (typically cooler, wetter months). Tolerates drier conditions in summer, reflecting its adaptation to Mediterranean climates with dry summers. |

## Introduction
Lepidium is a genus of plants in the mustard/cabbage family, Brassicaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. It includes familiar species such as garden cress, maca, and dittander. General common names include peppercress, peppergrass, pepperweed, and pepperwort.  Some species form tumbleweeds.
The genus name Lepidium is from Greek meaning 'small scale', which is thought to be derived from a folk medicine usage of the plant to treat leprosy, which cause small scales on the skin. Another meaning is related to the small scale-like fruit.

## Care Guide
Heckard's Pepperweed is adapted to California's Mediterranean climate, requiring full to partial sun exposure. It needs moderate watering during its active growth period but can withstand significant dry spells in summer. Minimal fertilization is sufficient, thriving in leaner soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils, as is common for many native plants adapted to less nutrient-rich environments.
