# Stirtonia Lichen
### *Stirtonia A.L. Sm.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, including parts of South America (e.g., Brazil, Colombia) and Southeast Asia (e.g., Papua New Guinea). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforests and Humid Subtropical Forests. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate indirect light; avoid direct, intense sunlight, as it typically grows under dense canopy cover or in shaded, humid environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and frequent access to moisture (e.g., misting, high ambient humidity). As a lichen, it absorbs water directly from the air and rain, not through roots, and benefits from periodic drying. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stirtonia lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest environment, requiring high humidity and low to moderate indirect light. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and its substrate, thus eliminating the need for traditional watering or fertilizing in substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain trace nutrients from atmospheric dust, rain, and their substrate; adding conventional fertilizers can be detrimental.
