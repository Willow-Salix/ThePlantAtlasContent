## Care Guide
This epiphytic fern thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest environment. Provide low to medium indirect light, maintain high humidity with consistent moisture, and fertilize lightly during active growth. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot as it naturally grows on trees.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a diluted liquid fertilizer (quarter-strength) once a month during the growing season; epiphytes are accustomed to minimal nutrients.
