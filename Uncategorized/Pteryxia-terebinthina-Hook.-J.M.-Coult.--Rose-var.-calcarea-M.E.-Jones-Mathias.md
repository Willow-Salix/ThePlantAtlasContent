# Turpentine Cymopterus

*Pteryxia terebinthina (Hook.) J.M. Coult. & Rose var. calcarea (M.E. Jones) Mathias* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly arid and semi-arid regions of the Southwestern United States (e.g., Utah, Nevada, Arizona, California, Oregon, Idaho) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Montane Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun. Thrives in open, exposed environments with high light intensity. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering. Highly drought-tolerant; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its native low-precipitation environment. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in sunny, dry conditions, mirroring its native arid scrubland habitat. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and has low fertilizer needs. Ensure well-draining, preferably calcareous, soil to mimic its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low. Native soils are often poor to moderate in nutrients. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, using a very dilute solution once a year.
