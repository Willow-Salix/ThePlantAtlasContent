## Care Guide
As a spring ephemeral from temperate deciduous forests, Carolina Springbeauty needs partial sun to partial shade and consistently moist soil during its early spring growth period. It thrives in rich, organic soil and goes dormant as summer approaches, preferring drier conditions at that time.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in rich, well-draining soil with high organic matter. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied during its brief active growth phase.
