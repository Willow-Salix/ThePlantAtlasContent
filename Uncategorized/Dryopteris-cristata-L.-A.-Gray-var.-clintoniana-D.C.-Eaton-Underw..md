## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (e.g., Northeastern United States, Great Lakes region, Eastern Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest / Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade. It naturally grows on the forest floor, protected by a tree canopy, or in shaded, moist wetland areas. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil; requires frequent watering to prevent drying out, mimicking its native swamp and moist woodland habitats. Avoid waterlogging, but do not allow soil to dry completely. |

## Introduction
The moth genus Dryopteris is now considered a junior synonym of Oreta.

Dryopteris , commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to Dryopteris filix-mas), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales.
Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American Dryopteris hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization.
The fossil record of this genus shows that it was widespread even as far back as the Cretaceous with fossils being found in Late Cretaceous rock layers from North America down to Antarctica.

## Care Guide
Clinton's Wood Fern thrives in consistently moist, organically rich soil under partial to full shade, mirroring its temperate woodland and wetland origins. Regular watering is essential to maintain soil moisture, and occasional feeding with an organic fertilizer will support its healthy growth. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot while keeping it moist.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with an organic, slow-release fertilizer or compost. Its native rich forest soils suggest a need for good organic matter content and regular nutrient replenishment.
