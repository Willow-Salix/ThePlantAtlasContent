## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Great Lakes Region of North America (specifically Michigan and Wisconsin, USA) |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Wetlands/Boreal Swamps |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Shade to Full Sun (requires constant moisture in full sun conditions) |
| **Watering** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native bog, fen, and swamp habitats. |

## Introduction
Polemonium, commonly called Jacob's ladders or Jacob's-ladders (the name derived from the Biblical story), is a genus of between 25 and 40 species of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae, native to cool temperate to arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. One species, Polemonium micranthum, also occurs in the southern Andes in South America. Many of the species grow at high altitudes, in mountainous areas. Most of the uncertainty in the number of species relates to those in Eurasia, many of which have been synonymized with Polemonium caeruleum.
Polemonium are perennial plants (rarely annual plants) growing 10–120 cm tall with bright green leaves divided into lance-shaped leaflets. They produce blue (rarely white or pink) flowers in the spring and summer.
Some species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora polemoniella.

## Care Guide
This rare subspecies thrives in consistently wet conditions, emulating its native bog and swamp habitats. It prefers partial shade but can tolerate full sun if ample moisture is constantly provided. Minimal fertilization is recommended, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to naturally nutrient-poor wetland soils. Minimal fertilization is best.
