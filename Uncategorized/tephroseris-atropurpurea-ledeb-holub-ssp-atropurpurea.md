## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canadian Arctic) and northeastern Asia (e.g., Siberia, Russian Far East) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. As an inhabitant of open tundra, it is accustomed to high light exposure and often long daylight hours during the growing season. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture during the growing season, mimicking snowmelt and steady, though not heavy, rainfall. Requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot, as waterlogging is common in tundra due to permafrost. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant requires full sun and consistently moist, very well-drained soil, mimicking its native tundra conditions. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments, avoid excessive fertilization and ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Tundra soils are naturally lean and nutrient-poor, so this plant is adapted to thrive with minimal nutrients. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
