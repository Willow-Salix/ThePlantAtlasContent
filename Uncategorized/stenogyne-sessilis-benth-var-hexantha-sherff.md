## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian native thrives in conditions replicating its tropical montane wet forest home, meaning consistent moisture, high humidity, and dappled light. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained. Fertilize moderately during growth periods to support its needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a moderate, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly (e.g., half-strength every 4-6 weeks) during its active growing season to support robust growth without over-enriching the soil.
