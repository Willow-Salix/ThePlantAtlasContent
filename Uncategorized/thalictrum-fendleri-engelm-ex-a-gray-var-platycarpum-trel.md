## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically montane regions of the southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane Forest. Characterized by distinct seasons, cold snowy winters, moderate summers, and often moist conditions along stream banks or in woodland understories. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial Shade to Full Sun. Thrives in partial shade, especially in warmer climates, but can tolerate full sun in cooler, high-elevation environments with consistent moisture. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist. Requires regular watering to keep the soil moist, especially during dry periods; does not tolerate prolonged drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Thalictrum ( ) is a genus of 120-200 species of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae, native mostly to temperate regions. Meadow-rue is a common name for plants in this genus.
Thalictrum is a taxonomically difficult genus with poorly understood species boundaries; it is in need of further taxonomic and field research for clarification.
Despite their common name of "meadow-rue", Thalictrum species are not closely related to the true rue (family Rutaceae), but resemble its members in having compound leaves twice or thrice divided.
