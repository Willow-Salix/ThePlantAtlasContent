## Introduction
Plagiobothrys is a genus of flowering plants known commonly as popcorn flowers. These are small herbaceous plants which bear tiny white or yellow flowers. Their fruits are nutlets. Although these plants are found predominantly in North America and South America, five species are known from Australia. Of the approximately 65 species described, more than 15 are endemic to California.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires a distinct wet-dry cycle, mimicking its native vernal pool habitat. Keep it consistently moist during its cool-season growing period, then allow it to dry out completely as it goes dormant in the warm, dry season. Minimal fertilizer is generally sufficient.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; native soils are not typically rich. A light, balanced fertilizer may be applied sparingly during the active growing season if needed.
