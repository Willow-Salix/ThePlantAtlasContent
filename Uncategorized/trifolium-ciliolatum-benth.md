## 🧤 Care Instructions
Foothill clover thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions typical of its native Mediterranean climate, adapted to wet winters and dry summers. Provide moderate water during its active growing season and very little fertilizer, especially nitrogen, as it fixes its own.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs, particularly for nitrogen, due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume. Supplement with a balanced, low-dose fertilizer only if growth appears significantly stunted.
