## Introduction
Berberis (), commonly known as barberry, is a large genus of deciduous and evergreen shrubs from 1–5 m (3+1⁄2–16+1⁄2 ft) tall, found throughout temperate and subtropical regions of the world (apart from Australia). Species diversity is greatest in South America and Asia, but native species also appear in Europe, Africa and North America. 
The best-known Berberis species is the type species, B. vulgaris (European barberry), which is common in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and central Asia; it has also been widely introduced in North America. Additionally, B. aquifolium is the state flower of Oregon.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant shrub thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, mimicking its native California chaparral habitat. Once established, it requires minimal watering and infrequent fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly in spring, or not at all in fertile soils, as native soils are often lean.
