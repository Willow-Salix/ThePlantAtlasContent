## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
Stiff Goldenrod thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native prairie environment. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization. This robust plant is generally drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization; excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
