## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical Africa, Asia (e.g., India, Southeast Asia) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet & Dry / Subtropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring brighter light for more vigorous growth. It is often found in open fields, disturbed sites, and forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is preferred, reflecting the high rainfall periods in its native tropical environment. Water regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, but avoid prolonged drought or waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Commelina is a genus of approximately 208 species commonly called dayflowers due to the short lives of their flowers. They are less often known as widow's tears. It is by far the largest genus of its family, Commelinaceae. The Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus of the 18th century named the genus after the two Dutch botanists Jan Commelijn and his nephew Caspar, each representing one of the showy petals of Commelina communis.
The dayflowers are herbs that may be either perennial or annual. They are characterised by their zygomorphic flowers and by the involucral bracts called spathes that surround the flower stalks. These spathes are often filled with a mucilaginous liquid. Each spathe houses either one or two scorpioid cymes, with the upper cyme being either vestigial or bearing from one to several typically male flowers, and the lower cyme bearing several flowers. All members of the genus have alternate leaves.
The Asiatic dayflower (Commelina communis) is probably the best known species in the West. It is a common weed in parts of Europe and throughout eastern North America. Several species, such as Commelina benghalensis, are eaten as a leaf vegetable in Southeast Asia and Africa.

## Care Guide
Commelina benghalensis thrives in warm, humid conditions with ample light from full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native tropical environment with regular rainfall. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its vigorous growth habit.

### Fertilizer
Due to its nature as a vigorous and often weedy plant, it does not require heavy fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer can be applied at half strength once a month during the active growing season if grown in containers or poor soil.
