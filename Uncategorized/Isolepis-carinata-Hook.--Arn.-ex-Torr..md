## Introduction
Isolepis is a genus of flowering plants in the sedge family, containing around 70 species. Isolepis is cosmopolitan, and often found in cool tropical and temperate climates in Africa and Australasia.
Isolepis was first described by prolific botanist Robert Brown in 1810. In 1870, the botanist Boeckeler disbanded the genus putting most of the names under a different genus, Scirpus. By the early 20th century Isolepis ceased to exist with other botanists following on from Boeckler's work. It was not until the late 20th century that Isolepis was reinstated as a distinct genus due to embryological research.

## Care Guide
This wetland plant requires consistently wet to submerged conditions, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Ensure the soil remains constantly moist or consider growing it in standing water, and provide moderate fertilization during its active growth for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilizer application, especially if container-grown; a balanced aquatic plant fertilizer can be applied during the active growing season.
