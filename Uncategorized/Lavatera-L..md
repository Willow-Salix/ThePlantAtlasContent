## Introduction
Malva is a genus of herbaceous or woody, annual, biennial, and perennial plants in the family Malvaceae.  It is one of several closely related genera in the family to bear the common English name mallow. The genus is widespread throughout the temperate, subtropical and tropical regions of Africa, Asia and Europe.
The leaves are alternate, palmately lobed. The flowers are from 0.5–5 cm diameter, with five pink, lilac, purple or white petals.

## Care Guide
Tree Mallows thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking their native Mediterranean climate. They are relatively drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering, and perform best with minimal fertilization to encourage flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly in spring with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer, especially if soil is poor. Excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth.
