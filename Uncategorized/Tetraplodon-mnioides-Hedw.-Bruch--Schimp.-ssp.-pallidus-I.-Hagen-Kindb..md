## Care Guide
This cold-hardy moss thrives in cool, moist, and well-lit conditions. It requires consistent humidity and a nutrient-rich substrate, reflecting its natural occurrence on decaying organic matter in open, northern environments.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, due to its natural habitat on nutrient-rich decaying organic matter (dung/carrion). A diluted, balanced fertilizer or a substrate rich in organic material can be beneficial.
