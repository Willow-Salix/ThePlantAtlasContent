## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily coastal plains of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Bogs/Wet Pine Savannas (Humid Subtropical) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and coloration, as they grow in open, unshaded bog environments. |
| **Watering** | Constant moisture is critical; the soil should never dry out. Mimic bog conditions by keeping the pot sitting in 1-2 inches of distilled, rainwater, or reverse osmosis water year-round. |

## Introduction
Sarracenia ( or ) is a genus comprising 8 to 11 species of North American pitcher plants, commonly called trumpet pitchers. The genus belongs to the family Sarraceniaceae, which also contain the closely allied genera Darlingtonia and Heliamphora.
Sarracenia is a genus of carnivorous plants indigenous to the eastern seaboard of the United States, Texas, the Great Lakes area and southeastern Canada, with most species occurring only in the south-east United States (only S. purpurea occurs in cold-temperate regions). The plant's leaves have evolved into a funnel or pitcher shape in order to trap insects.
The plant attracts its insect prey with secretions from extrafloral nectaries on the lip of the pitcher leaves, as well as a combination of the leaves' color and scent. Slippery footing at the pitcher's rim causes insects to fall inside, where they die and are digested by the plant with proteases and other enzymes.

## Care Guide
The Crimson Pitcherplant demands ample full sun and consistently wet, nutrient-poor, acidic conditions to thrive, reflecting its native bog habitat. Always use mineral-free water (distilled, rain, or RO) and refrain from fertilizing the soil.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required, as these carnivorous plants obtain nutrients from the insects they trap. Fertilizing the soil can be detrimental due to their adaptation to nutrient-poor bog soils.
