## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia (e.g., Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines), and Northern Australia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. As a climbing plant, it naturally seeks brighter light in the canopy but prefers protection from intense, direct afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry. Requires high humidity, often found in its native environment. |

## Introduction
Loeseneriella is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Celastraceae. The name is in honour of Ludwig Eduard Theodor Loesener (1865–1941), a German botanist who collected widely in the field in Germany and did much work on the Celastraceae. It was first described and published in the American Journal of Botany in 1941.

## Care Guide
Loeseneriella thrives in conditions mirroring its tropical rainforest origin, requiring consistently moist, well-draining soil and high humidity. Provide bright, indirect light and moderate fertilization during its growth periods to encourage its vigorous, climbing habit.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring through summer). Reduce frequency in colder months.
