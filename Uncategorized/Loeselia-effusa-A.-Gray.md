## Introduction
Loeselia is a genus of flowering plants in the phlox family Polemoniaceae, native to the southwestern United States, Mexico, Central America, Columbia and Venezuela. A number of species are found only in the Balsas Depression of southwestern Mexico. It was named for German botanist Johannes Loesel by Linnaeus in 1753.

## Care Guide
The Mexican Flame Flower thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-draining soil, mimicking its native habitat's distinct wet and dry seasons. Water moderately during its active growth, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and significantly reduce watering during winter dormancy. It benefits from low to moderate fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied once or twice during the active growing season is sufficient. Avoid over-fertilization.
