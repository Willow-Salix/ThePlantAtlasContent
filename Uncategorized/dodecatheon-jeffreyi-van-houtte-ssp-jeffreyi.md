## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including the Sierra Nevada, Cascade Range, and Rocky Mountains, from California north to British Columbia and east to Montana. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Montane Wet Meadows and Moist Woodlands, characterized by cold, snowy winters and a short, moist growing season from snowmelt in spring through early summer. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers cooler temperatures and consistent moisture, so some afternoon shade is beneficial in warmer climates to prevent scorching and maintain soil coolness. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil during its active growing period (spring and early summer), mimicking its natural habitat in seeps and streambanks. Tolerates drier conditions once dormant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Primula sect. Dodecatheon is a section of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. Primula species in this section were formerly placed in a separate genus, Dodecatheon. The species have basal clumps of leaves and nodding flowers that are produced at the top of tall stems rising from where the leaves join the crown. The genus is largely confined to North America and part of northeastern Siberia. Common names include shooting star, American cowslip, mosquito bills, mad violets, and sailor caps. A few species are grown in gardens for their showy and unique flower display.
The stamens are thrust out with the sepals bent back. The flowers are pollinated by bees, which grab hold of the petals, and gather pollen by vibrating the flowers by buzzing their wings (buzz pollination). The vibration releases pollen from the anthers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sierra shootingstar thrives in cool, moist environments typical of its mountain meadow origin. Provide full sun to partial shade, ensuring the soil remains consistently wet to moist throughout its spring and early summer growth, especially during periods of snowmelt. Fertilize sparingly with a dilute, balanced feed only if soil nutrients are poor, to avoid harming this native perennial.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally does not require heavy fertilization; a single application of a balanced, dilute liquid fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial if the soil is poor.
