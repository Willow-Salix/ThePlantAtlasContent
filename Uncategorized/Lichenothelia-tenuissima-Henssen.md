## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Antarctica, Subantarctic Islands (e.g., South Georgia), Arctic, and cold temperate mountainous regions globally. |
| **Climate** | Polar/Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure to bright indirect light, mimicking its exposed rocky habitat with minimal overhead canopy. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent but thorough wetting, allowing for extended dry periods between hydration. Absorbs moisture from atmospheric humidity and direct contact with water (e.g., meltwater, rain). |

## Introduction
Lichenothelia is a genus of fungi in the family Lichenotheliaceae. The genus was established in 1981 by David L. Hawksworth and includes 13 recognised species. These fungi form thin black crusts on rocks and other surfaces, producing distinctive dome-shaped fruiting bodies that eventually develop a dish-like depression in the centre. The genus represents the type of its own order, Lichenotheliales, which was created to accommodate these and related rock-dwelling fungi.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in the extreme, nutrient-poor conditions of polar and alpine tundra. It requires exposure to high light and infrequent, thorough hydration, followed by significant dry periods. Avoid fertilization as it can be detrimental to its growth.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; this lichen thrives in extremely nutrient-poor environments and can be harmed by excessive nutrients.
