## Care Guide
Water Horsetail is an aquatic plant demanding consistently wet or submerged conditions, ideally in full sun to partial shade. Provide a nutrient-rich substrate or minimal fertilization to mimic its natural wetland habitat for robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from occasional liquid aquatic plant fertilizer or nutrient-rich pond substrate, but generally not a heavy feeder.
