## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, humid environments reminiscent of its native montane forests. Provide bright, indirect light and ensure high, consistent humidity with regular moisture, avoiding complete desiccation. Fertilizers should be strictly avoided due to the lichen's sensitivity.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed. Lichens are highly sensitive to external nutrients and can be harmed by fertilizers.
