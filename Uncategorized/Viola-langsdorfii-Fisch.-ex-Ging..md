## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions of western North America (Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, northern California) and northeastern Asia (Kamchatka Peninsula, Sakhalin, Kuril Islands, northern Japan). |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest and Subalpine Wet Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade, avoiding direct intense afternoon sun. Prefers dappled light or filtered sun, mimicking its understory or wet meadow habitat. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained. Does not tolerate drying out completely; needs regular watering, especially during dry spells, reflecting its native preference for moist environments near streams or in bogs. |

## Introduction
The viola ( vee-OH-lə, () Italian: [ˈvjɔːla, viˈɔːla]) is a string instrument of the violin family, and is usually bowed when played. Violas are slightly larger than violins, and have a lower sound. Since the 18th century, it has been the middle or alto voice of the violin family, between the violin (which is tuned a perfect fifth higher) and the cello (which is tuned an octave lower). The strings from low to high are typically tuned to C3, G3, D4, and A4.
In the past, the viola varied in size and style, as did its names. The word viola originates from the Italian language. The Italians often used the term viola da braccio, meaning, literally, 'of the arm'. "Brazzo" was another Italian word for the viola, which the Germans adopted as Bratsche. The French had their own names: cinquiesme was a small viola, haute contre was a large viola, and taile was a tenor. Today, the French use the term alto, a reference to its range.
The viola was popular in the heyday of five-part harmony, up until the eighteenth century, taking three lines of the harmony and occasionally playing the melody line. Music notation for the viola differs from most other instruments in that it primarily uses the alto clef. When viola music has substantial sections in a higher register, it switches to the treble clef to make it easier to read.
The viola often plays the "inner voices" in string quartets and symphonic writing, and it is more likely than the first violin to play accompaniment parts. The viola occasionally plays a major, soloistic role in orchestral or chamber music. Examples include the symphonic poem Don Quixote, by Richard Strauss, the 13th Quartet by Dmitri Shostakovich, and a symphony with a main viola line: Harold en Italie, by Hector Berlioz. In the earlier part of the 20th century, more composers began to write for the viola, encouraged by the emergence of specialized soloists such as Lionel Tertis and William Primrose. English composers Arthur Bliss, Edwin York Bowen, Benjamin Dale, Frank Bridge, Benjamin Britten, Rebecca Clarke and Ralph Vaughan Williams all wrote substantial chamber and concert works. Many of these pieces were commissioned by, or written for, Tertis. William Walton, Bohuslav Martinů, Tōru Takemitsu, Tibor Serly, Alfred Schnittke, and Béla Bartók have written well-known viola concertos. The concerti by Bartók, Paul Hindemith, Carl Stamitz, Georg Philipp Telemann, and Walton are considered major works of the viola repertoire. Hindemith, who was a violist, wrote a substantial amount of music for viola, including the concerto Der Schwanendreher.

## Care Guide
Viola langsdorfii thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, emulating its native North Pacific coastal and subalpine habitats. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and protection from strong direct sun to prevent scorching. Provide light, regular fertilization to encourage healthy, vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Benefit from a weak, balanced liquid fertilizer or the addition of compost/organic matter annually, particularly in spring, as it grows in areas with moderate organic matter.
