## Introduction
Tithonia is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Heliantheae within the family Asteraceae.
Tithonia has a center of distribution in Mexico but with one species extending into the Southwestern United States and several native to Central America.  Two species, T. diversifolia and T. rotundifolia, are widely cultivated and have escaped to become weeds in tropical and subtropical areas around the world. T. rotundifolia makes a nice fresh cut flower, flowering in mid- to late-summer in the Northern hemisphere. The distinguishing feature of the genus is the peduncle, which is fistulose (meaning hollow and flaring toward the apex).  The plants are coarse annual or perennial herbs or shrubs, and one species, T. koelzii, is a small tree.

## Care Guide
This vigorous plant thrives in full sun and warm conditions, characteristic of its native tropical savannas. It requires consistent moisture during its active growth but can tolerate short dry spells. Plant in moderately fertile, well-draining soil to support its robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Thrives in average to fertile, well-draining soil. Benefits from occasional feeding with a balanced fertilizer or compost during its active growth.
