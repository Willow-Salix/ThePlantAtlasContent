## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically mountainous regions of California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Idaho, and Montana. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Riparian Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Sun to Full Sun, ideally with consistent moisture; tolerates full sun best in cooler parts of its range or with afternoon shade in warmer areas. |
| **Watering** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil, replicating its native habitat along streambanks and in wet meadows. Avoid allowing the soil to dry out. |

## Introduction
Epilobium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae, containing about 197 species. The genus has a worldwide distribution. It is most prevalent in the subarctic, temperate and subantarctic regions, whereas in the subtropics and tropics Epilobium species are restricted to the cool montane biomes, such as the New Guinea Highlands.
The taxonomy of the genus has varied between different botanists, but the modern trend is to include the previously recognised genera Boisduvalia, Chamaenerion (previously Chamerion), Pyrogennema and Zauschneria within Epilobium according to Peter H. Raven, who has extensively studied the willowherbs and merges the other segregate genera into Epilobium. Fringed willowherb (Epilobium ciliatum) is likely a cryptic species complex; apparently these plants also commonly hybridize with their congeners.
Most species are known by the common name willowherbs for their willow-like leaves. Those that were once separated in Boisduvalia are called spike-primroses or boisduvalias. Those Epilobium species previously placed in the Chamaenerion group are known as fireweeds.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in consistently moist to wet soil conditions, mirroring its native habitat along streambanks and wet meadows. It prefers partial sun but can tolerate full sun if kept adequately watered, especially in cooler climates. Fertilization needs are minimal, supporting its natural growth in temperate, moist environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; a balanced, diluted fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the active growing season.
