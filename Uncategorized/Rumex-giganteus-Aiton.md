## Introduction
The docks and sorrels, genus Rumex, are a genus of about 200 species of annual, biennial, and perennial herbs in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae.
Members of this genus are very common perennial herbs with a native almost worldwide distribution, and introduced species growing in the few places where the genus is not native.
Some are nuisance weeds (and are sometimes called dockweed or dock weed), but some are grown for their edible leaves. Rumex species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species, and are the only host plants of Lycaena dispar and Lycaena rubidus.

## Care Guide
Pawale thrives in conditions mimicking its native Hawaiian wet forests and bogs. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil remains consistently moist, never allowing it to dry out. Fertilize lightly to moderately during its active growth period to support its lush foliage.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season.
