## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma) and northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Grasslands/Scrublands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring direct sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily to mimic its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering, especially in poorly draining soil, can be detrimental. |

## Introduction
Aristida is a very nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. Aristida is distinguished by having three awns (bristles) on each lemma of each floret. The genus includes about 300 species found worldwide, often in arid warm regions. This genus is among those colloquially called three-awns wiregrasses, speargrasses and needlegrasses. The name Aristida is derived from the Latin "arista", meaning "awn".
They are characteristic of semiarid grassland. The Wiregrass Region of North America is named for A. stricta. Other locales where this genus is an important component of the ecosystem include the Carolina Bays, the sandhills of the Carolinas, and elsewhere, Mulga scrub in Australia, and the xeric grasslands around Lake Turkana in Africa. Local increases in the abundance of wiregrasses is a good indicator of overgrazing, as livestock avoid them.

## Care Guide
This hardy grass thrives in hot, sunny conditions and is highly drought-tolerant, typical of its native arid habitat. Provide full sun and infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between applications, and avoid over-fertilization as it prefers lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. This plant is adapted to lean soils; excessive fertilization can lead to weak growth. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer, if used at all, should be applied sparingly once per growing season.
