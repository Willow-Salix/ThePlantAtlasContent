## 🧤 Care Instructions
This woodland native thrives in partial to full shade with consistently moist, organically rich, and well-draining soil. Protect it from intense afternoon sun and ensure adequate moisture levels, particularly during dry periods, to mimic its natural forest floor habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, organic soil. An annual top-dressing of compost or a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring can support vigorous growth.
