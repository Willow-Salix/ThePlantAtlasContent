## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Sonoran Desert (Southwestern United States, Northwestern Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Arid Desert |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure. This lichen thrives in full, direct sunlight typical of exposed rock surfaces in desert environments. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent watering. Adapted to long periods of drought, absorbing moisture from dew, fog, or occasional rain. Requires excellent drainage and extended dry periods between any wetting. |

## Introduction
Xanthoparmelia (commonly known as green rock shields or rock-shield lichens) is a genus of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. This genus of lichen is commonly found in the United States, South America, southern Africa, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
The name means 'golden yellow parmelia'. The photobiont (photosynthetic partner) is Trebouxia (a genus of green algae).

## Care Guide
Xanthoparmelia joranadia, a desert lichen, thrives in high sun exposure and requires extremely infrequent wetting, allowing for prolonged dry periods. It does not require traditional fertilization, obtaining nutrients from the environment.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens derive nutrients directly from the atmosphere and rainwater; supplemental fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful.
