## 🧤 Care Instructions
Arctoa Moss requires a cool, consistently moist environment with high humidity and low to medium indirect light, replicating its native Arctic Tundra conditions. Ensure the substrate never dries out and provide minimal to no fertilization for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Tundra soils are nutrient-poor, so over-fertilization can be detrimental. Use a highly diluted specialized moss fertilizer only if growth seems stunted.
