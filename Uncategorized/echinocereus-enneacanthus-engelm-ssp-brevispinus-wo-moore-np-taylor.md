## 🌱 Overview
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives with ample direct sunlight and minimal watering, mimicking its arid native habitat. Ensure very well-draining soil to prevent root rot and provide fertilizer only sparsely during its growing period. Protect from frost and excessive winter moisture to ensure its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; apply a diluted, balanced cactus fertilizer sparingly (1-2 times) during the active growing season (spring/summer).
