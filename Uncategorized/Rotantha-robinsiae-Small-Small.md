## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Florida (USA), specifically in limestone hammocks and pinelands |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical to Tropical Savanna (Köppen Cfa/Aw), characterized by warm, wet summers and mild, drier winters, often in sheltered, high-humidity microclimates. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to dappled light is ideal, mimicking its understory habitat. Avoid direct, intense afternoon sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Keep the soil consistently moist but never waterlogged during the active growing season; allow the top inch of soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Reduce watering frequency in cooler, less active periods. |

## Introduction
Campanula () is the type genus of the Campanulaceae family of flowering plants. Campanula are commonly known as bellflowers and take both their common and scientific names from the bell-shaped flowers—campanula is Latin for "little bell".
The genus includes over 500 species and several subspecies, distributed across the temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with centers of diversity in the Mediterranean region, Balkans, Caucasus and mountains of western Asia. The range also extends into mountains in tropical regions of Asia and Africa.

The species include annual, biennial and perennial plants, and vary in habit from dwarf arctic and alpine species under 5 cm high, to large temperate grassland and woodland species growing to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall.

## Care Guide
This Florida native thrives in warm, humid environments with dappled light, similar to its natural habitat in shaded, rocky hammocks. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil and provide light, regular fertilization during active growth. Protect from cold temperatures and frost.

### Fertilizer
Apply a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler, dormant periods.
