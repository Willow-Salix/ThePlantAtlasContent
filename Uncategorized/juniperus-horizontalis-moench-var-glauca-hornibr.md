## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America (primarily Canada and the Northern United States) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cold Temperate (found in boreal forest edges, prairies, rocky outcrops, and sandy areas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open, exposed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings; it is drought-tolerant once established and requires excellent drainage, reflecting its adaptation to dry, well-drained soils in its native range. |

## 🌱 Overview
Junipers are coniferous trees and shrubs in the genus Juniperus ( joo-NIP-ər-əs) of the cypress family Cupressaceae. Depending on the taxonomy, between 50 and 67 species of junipers are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere as far south as tropical Africa, as far north as the Arctic, and parts of Asia and Central America. The highest-known juniper forest occurs at an altitude of 4,900 metres (16,100 ft) in southeastern Tibet and the northern Himalayas, creating one of the highest tree lines on earth.
