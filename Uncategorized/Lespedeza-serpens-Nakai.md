## Introduction
Lespedeza is a genus of some 45 species (including nothospecies) of flowering plants in the pea family (Fabaceae), commonly known as bush clovers or (particularly East Asian species) Japanese clovers (hagi). The genus is native to warm temperate to subtropical regions of eastern North America, eastern and southern Asia and Australasia.
These shrubby plants or trailing vines belong to the "typical" legumes (Faboideae), with the peas and beans, though they are part of another tribe, the Desmodieae. Therein, they are treated as type genus of the smaller subtribe Lespedezinae, which unites the present genus and its presumed closest relatives, Campylotropis and Kummerowia.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in sunny to partly shaded locations and prefers consistent, moderate watering, though it can tolerate periods of drought. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for temperate climates.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it's a legume that fixes nitrogen; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied annually if soil nutrients are poor.
