## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Maui, Hawaii, USA |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to partial shade; prefers indirect light and protection from harsh direct sun, mimicking a forest understory. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil is essential; do not allow to dry out. Requires high humidity, typical of its native rainforest habitat. |

## Introduction
The moth genus Dryopteris is now considered a junior synonym of Oreta.

Dryopteris , commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to Dryopteris filix-mas), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales.
Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American Dryopteris hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization.
The fossil record of this genus shows that it was widespread even as far back as the Cretaceous with fossils being found in Late Cretaceous rock layers from North America down to Antarctica.

## Care Guide
The Maui woodfern thrives in conditions that mimic its native Hawaiian rainforest understory. Provide consistently moist soil, high humidity, and low to partial shade, avoiding direct sunlight. Fertilize lightly during active growth to support its moderate nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength during the growing season (spring and summer).
