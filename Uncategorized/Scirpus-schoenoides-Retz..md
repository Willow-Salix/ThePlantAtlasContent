## Care Guide
This semi-aquatic sedge thrives in full sun and requires continuously wet or submerged soil, mirroring its native marshland habitat. Fertilize moderately during active growth, ensuring its roots are always in water for optimal health and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. Benefits from a balanced aquatic or slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season, though it can tolerate nutrient-poor wetland soils if kept adequately wet.
