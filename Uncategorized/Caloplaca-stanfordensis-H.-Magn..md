## Introduction
Caloplaca is a lichen genus comprising a number of distinct species. Members of the genus are commonly called firedot lichen, jewel lichen. gold lichens, "orange lichens", but they are not always orange, as in the case of C. albovariegata. The distribution of this lichen genus is worldwide, extending from Antarctica to the high Arctic. It includes a portion of northern North America and the Russian High Arctic. There are about thirty species of Caloplaca in the flora of the British Isles.
A new species of Caloplaca, C. obamae, the first species to be named in honor of Barack Obama, was discovered in 2007 on Santa Rosa Island in California and published in March 2009.

## Care Guide
The Stanford orange lichen is a hardy, rock-dwelling species adapted to the bright, dry conditions of Western North America's Mediterranean climate. Provide full sun and ensure excellent air circulation. It requires no traditional watering or fertilization, relying on atmospheric moisture and nutrients from its substrate.

### Fertilizer
Not required; lichens obtain necessary nutrients from air, dust, and their substrate, and are sensitive to synthetic fertilizers.
