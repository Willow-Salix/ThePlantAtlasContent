## Introduction
The blackberry is an edible fruit ("berry") produced by many species in the genus Rubus in the family Rosaceae, hybrids among these species within the subgenus Rubus, and hybrids between the subgenera Rubus and Idaeobatus. The taxonomy of blackberries has historically been confused because of hybridization and apomixis so that species have often been grouped together and called species aggregates.
Blackberry fruit production is abundant with annual volumes of 20,000 pounds (9,100 kg) per 1 acre (0.40 ha) possible, making this plant commercially attractive.
Rubus armeniacus (Himalayan or Armenian blackberry) is considered a noxious weed and invasive species in many regions of the Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States, where it grows out of control in urban and suburban parks and woodlands.

## Care Guide
Blackberries are robust plants suited for temperate climates, preferring full sun to partial shade. They require consistently moist, well-drained, and fertile soil. Regular watering, particularly during dry spells, and moderate annual fertilization will ensure healthy growth and abundant fruit.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Thrives in fertile soil amended with organic matter. Apply a balanced fertilizer in early spring, or annually incorporate compost into the soil.
