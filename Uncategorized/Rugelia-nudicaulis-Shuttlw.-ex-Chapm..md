## Introduction
Rugelia nudicaulis (Rugel's Indian plantain or Rugels ragwort), the sole species of the genus Rugelia, blooms in summer.  It is a wildflower endemic to higher elevations in the Great Smoky Mountains. It is a rare species in Tennessee. Genetic diversity in this plant, assessed using allozymes, is so low that the species may not survive changing environmental conditions. Both the scientific name and the common names honor Ferdinand Rugel, a botanist and plant collector who collected plant specimens throughout the southeastern United States during the period 1840–1848.

## Care Guide
Rugel's Indianplantain thrives in cool, moist, and shady conditions, mimicking its native temperate forest floor habitat. It requires consistently moist, rich soil and protection from direct, harsh sunlight. Provide regular watering and enrich the soil annually with compost or a balanced fertilizer for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, organic soil; annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season is beneficial.
