## Introduction
Crumia latifolia is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae, and is the sole representative of the genus Crumia.
The species is found in low to mid elevation sites throughout the western United States and Canada. Exposed individuals may turn a reddish-brown color. It was described by Wilfred Borden Schofield in 1966.

## Care Guide
Crumia moss thrives in cool, humid environments reminiscent of its native temperate forest floor. Provide consistent moisture, high humidity, and partial to full shade, avoiding direct sunlight. Fertilization is rarely necessary, as these plants have minimal nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Very low; mosses generally require minimal to no fertilization. If desired, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly once or twice a year.
