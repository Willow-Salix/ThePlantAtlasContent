# Script Lichen
### *Graphis desquamescens (Fée) Zahlbr.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical regions of the Americas (Neotropics) and Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests (Rainforests) |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate indirect light. Avoid direct, intense sunlight, which can cause desiccation and bleaching, mimicking its shaded understory habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high humidity (70-90%) and frequent ambient moisture. While they don't need 'watering' like vascular plants, regular misting or placement in a humid environment (like a terrarium) is essential to keep them hydrated. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Script lichen thrives in consistently high humidity and low to moderate indirect light, emulating its native tropical rainforest environment. Provide regular ambient moisture through misting or terrarium conditions, and strictly avoid direct sunlight or any traditional fertilizers, as these can be detrimental to its delicate symbiotic structure.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens absorb necessary trace nutrients from the air, rainwater, and their substrate; excess nutrients or pollutants can be harmful.
