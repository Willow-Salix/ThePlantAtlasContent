## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., New Mexico, Arizona, Texas), Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | High direct sun to partial shade, typically found in exposed, dry environments on rock surfaces, requiring adequate light for its photosynthetic partner. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent rehydration from atmospheric moisture such as rain, dew, or high humidity; highly tolerant of extended dry periods and desiccation. |

## Introduction
Dermatocarpon is a genus of lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. Members of the genus are commonly called stippleback lichens because they have fruiting structures called perithecia that are flask-shaped structures embedded in the nonfruiting body (thallus), with a hole in the top to release spores, causing an appearance of being covered with small black dots. Its species are told apart chiefly by spore size, the colour and texture of the lower surface, and whether the epinecral layer gives a pruinose bloom.

## Care Guide
This lichen is adapted to arid, exposed conditions, relying on infrequent rehydration from atmospheric moisture rather than direct watering. It requires high light exposure for photosynthesis and does not need conventional fertilization, sourcing its nutrients from the environment.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; obtains essential nutrients from airborne dust, dissolved minerals in precipitation, and the substrate it grows on, not from traditional soil fertilization.
