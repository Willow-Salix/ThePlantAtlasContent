## 🧤 Care Instructions
Indian woodoats prefers partial shade and consistently moist, organically rich soil, emulating its native woodland environment. Provide regular watering, especially during dry spells, and amend with compost for optimal health, though it is quite adaptable once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from organically rich soil. Mimicking its native woodland floor, amend soil with compost rather than heavy chemical fertilization.
