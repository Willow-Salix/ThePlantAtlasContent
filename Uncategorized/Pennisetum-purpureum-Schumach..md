## Care Guide
Elephant grass thrives in full sun and requires abundant water during its active growing season to mimic its tropical grassland origins. To support its rapid and vigorous growth, regular fertilization with a high-nitrogen product is essential for optimal health and development.

### Fertilizer
As a fast-growing and productive grass, it is a heavy feeder. It benefits greatly from regular applications of a balanced, high-nitrogen fertilizer throughout the growing season to support its vigorous growth.
