## Introduction
Spathoglottis, commonly known as purple orchids or 苞舌兰属 (bao she lan shu) is a genus of about fifty species of orchids in the family Orchidaceae. They are evergreen terrestrial herbs with crowded pseudobulbs, a small number of leaves and medium-sized resupinate flowers on an upright flowering stem. The sepals and petals are all similar to each other and are white, yellow, pink or purple. Species of Spathoglottis are found from eastern and south-eastern Asia to Australia and some Pacific Islands.

## Care Guide
The Philippine Ground Orchid thrives in warm, humid tropical conditions with bright, indirect light or partial sun. It requires consistent moisture during active growth, ensuring excellent drainage, and benefits from regular feeding. Protect it from harsh afternoon sun and allow the potting mix to dry slightly between waterings.

### Fertilizer
Regular feeding during the active growing season (spring to fall) with a balanced orchid fertilizer or general purpose liquid fertilizer at half strength every 2-4 weeks. Reduce or stop fertilization in winter.
