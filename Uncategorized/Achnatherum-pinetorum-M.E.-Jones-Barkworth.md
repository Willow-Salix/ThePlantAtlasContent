| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Forest / Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) to partial shade, especially in hotter afternoon sun. |

## Introduction
Achnatherum is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It includes 20 species of needlegrass native to temperate Eurasia and North Africa. Several needlegrass species have been switched between Achnatherum and genus Stipa; taxonomy between the two closely related genera is still uncertain. In 2019 Peterson et al. reorganized the genera in tribe Stipeae based on molecular DNA studies, and placed the species from the Americas into other genera.

## Care Guide
Pine Needlegrass is a hardy, drought-tolerant perennial grass native to the dry, open slopes and pine forests of western North America. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established. Fertilization is generally not needed or should be very light.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. If necessary, a light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, or none at all in moderately fertile soil.
