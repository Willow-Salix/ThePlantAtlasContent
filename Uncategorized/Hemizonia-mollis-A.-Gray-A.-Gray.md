## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, United States (specifically North Coast Ranges and Central Coast) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (coastal grasslands, chaparral, coastal sage scrub) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during summer dormancy. Water more regularly during its active growth in cooler months. |

## Introduction
Hemizonia is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae. They are known generally as tarweeds, although some tarweeds belong to other genera, such as Madia and Deinandra. Furthermore, Hemizonia is currently being revised; some species may be segregated into new genera.

## Care Guide
Soft Tarweed is a California native adapted to full sun and dry Mediterranean summers. It requires infrequent watering, thriving in drought-like conditions once established, particularly during its summer dormancy. Minimal fertilization is needed, ideally during its cooler active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a light, balanced fertilizer application during its active growing season (winter/spring), or generally requires little to no fertilization in good soil.
