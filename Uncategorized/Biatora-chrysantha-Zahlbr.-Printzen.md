## Introduction
Biatora is a genus of lichens in the family Ramalinaceae. Originally circumscribed in 1817, the genus consists of crustose and squamulose lichens with green algal photobionts, biatorine apothecia, colorless, simple to 3-septate ascospores, and bacilliform pycnospores.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, humid, and shaded environments, replicating its native old-growth conifer forest habitat. It requires consistent moisture and high atmospheric humidity, with minimal to no external fertilization due to its sensitivity.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. Lichens are sensitive to pollutants and excessive nutrients, typically absorbing what they need from air and rain.
