## Introduction
Bidens is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. The genus include roughly 230 species which are distributed worldwide. Despite their global distribution, the systematics and taxonomy of the genus has been described as complicated and unorganized. The common names beggarticks, black jack, burr marigolds, cobbler's pegs, Spanish needles, stickseeds, tickseeds and tickseed sunflowers refer to the fruits of the plants, most of which are bristly and barbed. The generic name refers to the same character; Bidens comes from the Latin bi ("two") and dens ("tooth").

## Care Guide
Kennebec Bur-marigold thrives in full sun and requires constant moisture, with its roots ideally submerged or in very wet soil, mirroring its native intertidal wetland habitat. Provide a moderately rich substrate to support its growth. Consistent water levels are crucial for its well-being.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a moderately rich to nutrient-rich substrate, reflecting the silts and organic matter found in riverine environments. Moderate fertilization may be needed if substrate is poor.
