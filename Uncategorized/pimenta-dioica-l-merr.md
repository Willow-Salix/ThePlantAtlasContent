## 🌱 Overview
Allspice, also known as Jamaica pepper, myrtle pepper, pimenta, or pimento, is the dried unripe berry of Pimenta dioica, a midcanopy tree native to the Greater Antilles, southern Mexico, and Central America, now cultivated in many warm parts of the world. The name allspice was coined as early as 1621 by the English, who valued it as a spice that combined the flavours of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. Contrary to common misconception, it is not a mixture of spices.
Several unrelated fragrant shrubs are called "Carolina allspice" (Calycanthus floridus), "Japanese allspice" (Chimonanthus praecox), or "wild allspice" (Lindera benzoin).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Allspice thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright light, mimicking its tropical origins. Ensure consistently moist, well-drained soil and provide regular fertilization during its active growth period to promote healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer), reducing in fall and winter.
