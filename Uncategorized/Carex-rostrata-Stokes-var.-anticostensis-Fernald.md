## Care Guide
This wetland sedge thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently wet to saturated soil, mimicking its native bog and marsh habitats. Minimal fertilization is typically needed, reflecting its adaptation to naturally moist, often nutrient-variable environments. Ensure continuous moisture for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not a heavy feeder and may not require regular fertilization in suitable soil conditions.
