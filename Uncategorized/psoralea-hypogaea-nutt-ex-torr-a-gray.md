| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (from North Carolina south to Florida and west to Louisiana and Texas) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Woodlands/Grasslands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving best with ample direct sunlight as it naturally grows in open woodlands and sandhills. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the sandy soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Psoralea is a genus in the legume family (Fabaceae) with 121 species of shrubs, trees, and herbs native to southern and eastern Africa, ranging from Kenya to South Africa.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Psoralea hypogaea thrives in bright, sunny conditions with excellent drainage, mimicking its native open woodland and sandhill environments. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; generally requires minimal or no fertilizer due to its adaptation to lean, sandy soils. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring may be applied if growth is poor.
