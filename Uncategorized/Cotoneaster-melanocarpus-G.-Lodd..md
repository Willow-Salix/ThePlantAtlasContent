## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Europe, Central Asia (including Ukraine, Russia, Caucasus, Siberia, Mongolia, and parts of China) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Continental (Steppe, Open Woodland, Scrubland) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat of open woodlands and scrub, it experiences good sun exposure but can tolerate some dappled shade. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. The plant's native regions experience distinct seasons with moderate rainfall, suggesting it prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil, tolerating some drought once established. |

## Introduction
Cotoneaster  is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, native to the Palaearctic region (temperate Asia, Europe, north Africa), with a strong concentration of diversity in the genus in the mountains of southwestern China and the Himalayas. They are related to hawthorns (Crataegus), firethorns (Pyracantha), photinias (Photinia), and rowans (Sorbus).
Depending on the species definition used, between 70 and 300 different species of Cotoneaster are described, with many apomictic microspecies treated as species by some authors, but only as varieties by others.
The majority of species are shrubs from 0.5–5 m (1.6–16.4 ft) tall, varying from ground-hugging prostrate plants to erect shrubs; a few, notably C. frigidus, are small trees up to 15 m (49 ft) tall and 75 cm (30 in) trunk diameter. The prostrate species are mostly alpine plants growing at high altitudes (e.g. C. integrifolius, which grows at 3,000–4,000 m (9,800–13,100 ft) in the Himalayas), while the larger species occur in scrub and woodland gaps at lower altitudes.

## Care Guide
The Dark-Fruited Cotoneaster thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications. Reflecting its origins in temperate continental regions, it is a hardy shrub that tolerates average soil conditions and does not demand heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native soils in steppe and woodland environments are typically not excessively rich, so minimal fertilization or a balanced, slow-release formula in spring is usually sufficient.
