## Care Guide
This saxicolous lichen thrives on exposed, acid rocks in full sun within temperate and boreal regions. It requires periodic rehydration from environmental moisture (rain, mist, dew) followed by periods of complete desiccation. Avoid fertilizers and maintain good air quality, as it is sensitive to pollutants.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; highly sensitive to excess nutrients and atmospheric pollutants.
