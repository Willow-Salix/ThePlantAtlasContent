## Introduction
Bola de Nieve (literally Snowball; 11 September 1911 – 2 October 1971), born Ignacio Jacinto Villa Fernández, was a Cuban singer-pianist and songwriter. His name originates from his round, black face.
Villa Fernández was born in Guanabacoa, eastern Havana, where he studied at the Conservatorio de José Mateu. He worked as a chauffeur and played piano for silent films until his friend Rita Montaner took him on as an accompanist in the early 1930s. After Montaner returned to Cuba, Villa Fernández remained in Mexico and developed an original performance style as a pianist and singer. He was an elite rather than a popular figure, a sophisticated cabaret stylist known for ironic patter, subtle musical interpretation, with a repertoire that included songs in French, English, Catalan, Portuguese, and Italian. He toured widely in Europe and the Americas, and his friends included Andrés Segovia and Pablo Neruda. He was black and gay, and was self-confident in his personality, and accepted for what he was: a memorable talent.
He died in Mexico City during a musical visit.
He was the subject of a 2003 documentary which included interviews with fellow musicians, friends, relatives, and experts.

## Care Guide
This tropical plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native rainforest habitat, requiring consistently moist soil, high humidity, and bright, indirect light. Protect it from intense direct sun and feed regularly during its active growth period to ensure robust flowering and healthy foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to heavy feeder. Fertilize monthly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, acid-loving plant fertilizer.
