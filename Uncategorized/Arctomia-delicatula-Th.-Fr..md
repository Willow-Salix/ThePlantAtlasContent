## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Scandinavia, Greenland, and mountainous areas of North America and Eurasia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Adapted to bright, cool, and often exposed conditions; can tolerate full sun in higher latitudes but also thrives in partial shade. |
| **Watering** | Moisture primarily from precipitation, fog, or high humidity; tolerant of periods of desiccation. Requires excellent air circulation. |

## Introduction
Arctomia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Arctomiaceae. The genus was established in 1860 by the Swedish lichenologist Theodor Magnus Fries, and species of Arctomia are mainly distributed in circumpolar regions of the Northern Hemisphere. A comprehensive molecular study published in 2025 confirmed that the genus forms a distinct evolutionary lineage within its family. Species typically grow as thin, reddish-brown to blackish crusts on plant debris, mosses, or tree bark in cold northern regions, with their distribution ranging from the Arctic tundra to boreal forests and alpine heaths. The thallus contains cyanobacteria of the genus Nostoc as the photosynthetic partner, giving the lichen a slightly glossy, gelatinous texture when wet. Most species produce minute disc-shaped fruiting bodies containing elongated, many-celled ascospores.

## Care Guide
This delicate lichen thrives in cool, exposed environments with consistent moisture from the atmosphere and abundant air circulation. It requires bright, indirect light to full sun adapted to its high-latitude origins, and absolutely no traditional fertilization. Mimicking its nutrient-poor, rocky or soil-bound habitat is crucial for its survival.

### Fertilizer
None; lichens obtain nutrients from atmospheric deposition and are sensitive to artificial fertilizers.
