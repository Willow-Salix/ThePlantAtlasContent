| **Native Origin** | Northeastern North America (including eastern Canada and northeastern United States) |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Woodland/Bog |
| **Sunlight** | Low Light to Partial Shade (mimicking forest understory conditions) |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil, never allowed to dry out completely, reflecting its natural boggy or swampy habitat. Ensure good drainage to prevent rot. |

## Introduction
Neottia is a genus of orchids. The genus now includes the former genus Listera,  commonly known as twayblades, referring to the single pair of  opposite leaves at the base of the flowering stem. The genus is native to temperate, subarctic and arctic regions across most of Europe, northern Asia (Siberia, China, the Himalayas, Central Asia, etc), and North America, with a few species extending into subtropical regions in the Mediterranean, Indochina, the southeastern United States, etc.
Neottia produces a racemose inflorescences with flowers in shades of green or dull pink through to  maroon and purple. The lip of each flower is prominently forked or two-lobed. Some species (those which were previously the only members of the genus Neottia in the strict sense, such as the bird's-nest orchid, Neottia nidus-avis) are completely without chlorophyll and have leaves which are reduced to scales.

## Care Guide
This delicate terrestrial orchid thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded woodland or bog environments. Replicate its native habitat by providing low light, maintaining a damp (but not waterlogged) substrate, and offering minimal, diluted fertilizer during active growth to support its specific needs.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a highly diluted, balanced orchid fertilizer during the active growing season. Terrestrial orchids generally require less fertilization than epiphytic types.
