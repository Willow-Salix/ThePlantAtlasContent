## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cape Tulips thrive in full sun and a Mediterranean climate, requiring distinct wet and dry periods. Provide regular water during their active growth from autumn to spring, followed by a dry dormancy in summer. Ensure well-draining soil and light fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the active growing season. Use a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer sparingly, as these plants are not heavy feeders.
