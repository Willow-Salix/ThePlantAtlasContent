## Care Guide
Balloon Flowers are hardy perennials native to temperate East Asia, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. They are relatively low-maintenance, requiring only moderate watering and minimal fertilization. Good drainage is crucial to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Generally not a heavy feeder. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring, or a diluted liquid fertilizer every few weeks during the growing season, is usually sufficient. Avoid over-fertilizing.
