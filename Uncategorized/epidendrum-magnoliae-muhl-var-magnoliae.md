## 🌱 Overview
Epidendrum , abbreviated Epi in the horticultural trade, is a large neotropical genus of the orchid family. With more than 1,500 species,  some authors describe it as a mega-genus. The genus name (from Greek επί, epi and δένδρον, dendron, "upon trees") refers to its epiphytic growth habit.
When Carl Linnaeus named this genus in 1763, he included in this genus all the epiphytic orchids known to him. Although few of these orchids are still included in the genus Epidendrum, some species of Epidendrum are nevertheless not epiphytic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide bright, indirect light and maintain consistent moisture, allowing the plant to dry slightly between waterings, while ensuring high humidity. Fertilize regularly with a dilute orchid-specific feed to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Regular, dilute fertilization with a balanced orchid fertilizer, especially during active growth, to simulate nutrients from organic debris.
