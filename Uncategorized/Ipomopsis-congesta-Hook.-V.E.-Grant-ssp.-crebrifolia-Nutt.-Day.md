## Care Guide
This plant thrives in environments mimicking its native arid scrubland and montane desert habitats. Provide full sun exposure and allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought tolerant. Fertilizer is rarely needed, preferring lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to None; thrives in lean, poor to moderately rich soils. If needed, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly during the growing season.
