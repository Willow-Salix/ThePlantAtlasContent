## Introduction
Pohlia is a genus of mosses in the family Mniaceae, found on all continents including Antarctica. Some of its species are native to multiple continents. The center of diversity is the Northern Hemisphere.
The genus name of Pohlia is in honour of Johann Ehrenfried Pohl (1746–1800), who was a German physician and botanist. 
The genus was circumscribed by Johann Hedwig in Descriptio et Adumbratio microscopio-analytica Muscorum
Frondosorum vol.1 on page 98 in 1785-1787.

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, consistently moist environments with low to moderate indirect light. Ensure high humidity and a perpetually damp (but not soggy) substrate. Fertilizer requirements are minimal, reflecting its natural habitat on nutrient-poor surfaces.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs; use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly, if at all.
