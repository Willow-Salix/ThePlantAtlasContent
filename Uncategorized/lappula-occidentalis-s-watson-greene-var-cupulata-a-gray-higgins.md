## 🌱 Overview
Lappula is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family known generally as stickseeds. They are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the world, including North America, Eurasia, North Africa, South Africa, and southern South America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Flatspine Stickseed thrives in sunny, dry conditions typical of its native semi-arid grasslands. Provide full sun and ensure excellent soil drainage to prevent root rot. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to fully dry out between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental to a plant adapted to nutrient-sparse environments.
