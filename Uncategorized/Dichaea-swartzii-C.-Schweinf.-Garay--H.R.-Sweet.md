| **Native Origin** | Tropical Central and South America (e.g., Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light; avoids direct harsh sun found under a dense canopy or in misty conditions. |

## Care Guide
This orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its native cloud forest. Provide bright indirect light, maintain consistent moisture with excellent drainage, and ensure high humidity. Regular application of a weak orchid fertilizer during active growth will support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Weak, balanced orchid fertilizer applied frequently (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) during active growth, as nutrients are scarce for epiphytes in their natural habitat.
