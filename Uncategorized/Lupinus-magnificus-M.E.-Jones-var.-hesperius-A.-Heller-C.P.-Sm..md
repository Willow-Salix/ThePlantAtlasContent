| **Native Origin** | Panamint Mountains, Inyo County, California, USA |
| **Climate** | High Desert Scrubland and Montane Arid Slopes |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun, at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with its open, high-elevation native habitat. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
This desert-adapted lupine thrives in full sun and requires very little water once established, preferring lean, well-drained soils. Avoid overwatering and heavy fertilization to ensure its health and promote flowering.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization needed due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume; prefers lean, well-drained soil. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
