## 🌱 Overview
Phaseolus (bean, wild bean) is a genus of herbaceous to woody annual and perennial vines in the family Fabaceae containing about 70 plant species, all native to the Americas, primarily Mesoamerica.
It is one of the most economically important legume genera. Five of the species have been domesticated since pre-Columbian times for their beans: P. acutifolius (tepary bean), P. coccineus (runner bean), P. dumosus (year bean), P. lunatus (lima bean), and P. vulgaris (common bean). Most prominent among these is the common bean, P. vulgaris, which today is cultivated worldwide in tropical, semitropical, and temperate climates.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This warm-season legume requires full sun and consistent moisture, particularly when flowering and setting pods. As a nitrogen-fixer, it needs low nitrogen fertilizer but benefits from rich, well-draining soil with adequate phosphorus and potassium to support its growth and yield.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nitrogen, moderate phosphorus and potassium; thrives in well-draining soil enriched with organic matter.
