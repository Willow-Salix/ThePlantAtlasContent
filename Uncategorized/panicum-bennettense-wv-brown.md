## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Brazilian grass thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native Tropical Savanna environment. It requires moderate watering during its active growth phase, tolerating drier periods. Due to naturally nutrient-poor soils, light fertilization is sufficient to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the growing season is sufficient, preferably with a balanced, slow-release granular or diluted liquid fertilizer. Avoid heavy fertilization as native soils are often nutrient-poor.
