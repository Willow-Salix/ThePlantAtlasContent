## Introduction
Setaria is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family. The name is derived from the Latin word seta, meaning "bristle" or "hair", which refers to the bristly spikelets.
The genus includes over 100 species distributed in many tropical and temperate regions around the world, and members are commonly known as foxtail or bristle grasses.

## Care Guide
Reverchon's Bristlegrass thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate grasslands, requiring full to partial sun and well-drained soil. It is very drought-tolerant once established, needing moderate watering only when the soil is dry. Fertilization is generally not necessary, as it adapts well to leaner nutrient conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in lean, well-drained soils and typically does not require heavy fertilization.
