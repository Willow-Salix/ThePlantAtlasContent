## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including southwestern United States (e.g., California, Arizona, Nevada) and Baja California, Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid (e.g., Mediterranean, Desert Scrub) |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure or bright indirect light, adapted to open and exposed conditions on rocks or bark. |
| **Watering** | As a lichen, it absorbs moisture directly from the air (humidity, dew, rain). Requires periodic rehydration (e.g., misting) followed by complete drying periods to prevent rot. Does not require traditional watering into soil. |

## Introduction
Ramalina is a genus of greenish fruticose lichens that grow in the form of flattened, strap-like branches. Members of the genus are commonly called strap lichens or cartilage lichens. Apothecia are lecanorine.
It is in the family Ramalinaceae and in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
As an epiphytic lichen from arid regions, Fistulariella Minuscula thrives with high light exposure and requires periodic rehydration via misting or humidity, followed by dry periods. Avoid traditional watering and fertilization, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and substrate, not through roots.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required. Obtains necessary trace nutrients from dust, rainwater, and its substrate. High nutrient levels can be detrimental.
