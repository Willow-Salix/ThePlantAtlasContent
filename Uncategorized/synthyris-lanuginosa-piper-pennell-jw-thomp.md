## 🌱 Overview
Veronica is the largest genus in the flowering plant family Plantaginaceae, with about 500 species. It was formerly classified in the family Scrophulariaceae. Common names include speedwell, bird's eye, and gypsyweed.
Taxonomy for this genus was changed in the early 21st century, with the genus Hebe and the related Australasian genera Derwentia, Detzneria, Chionohebe, Heliohebe, Leonohebe and Parahebe now included. Monophyly of the genus is supported by nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and cpDNA.
The taxa of the genus are herbaceous annuals or perennials, and also subshrubs, shrubs or small trees when Hebe is included. Most of the species are from the temperate Northern Hemisphere, though with some species from the Southern Hemisphere; Veronica sect. Hebe is mostly from New Zealand.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Woolly Synthyris thrives in cool, bright conditions with full to partial sun and extremely well-draining, gritty soil. Provide moderate, consistent moisture during its active growth period, being vigilant about preventing waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, as this plant prefers lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; adapted to lean, gritty soils. A very dilute, balanced fertilizer applied once in early spring may be beneficial, but over-fertilization should be avoided.
