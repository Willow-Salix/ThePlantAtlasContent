## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (specifically, coastal plain pine flatwoods, savannas, and wet barrens) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil conditions, especially during the growing season. While it prefers moisture, it also requires good drainage, typical of sandy coastal soils. |

## Introduction
Polygala is a large genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygalaceae. They are commonly known as milkworts or snakeroots. The genus is distributed widely throughout much of the world in temperate zones and the tropics. The genus name Polygala comes from the ancient Greek "much milk", as the plant was thought to increase milk yields in cattle.

## Care Guide
This coastal plain species thrives in full sun to partial sun with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native wet pine barren habitat. It requires low to moderate fertilization, as it's accustomed to nutrient-poor environments. Ensure high humidity and adequate soil moisture for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility. Adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils, so light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula once in spring is generally sufficient, or none at all.
