## Introduction
The Arctic poppy (Papaver radicatum) is a flowering plant in the Papaveraceae family. It may also be referred to as rooted poppy or yellow poppy. Arctic poppies grow in cold climate conditions and are found in Arctic regions throughout the world. Arctic poppies have adaptations, such as heliotropism and physical characteristics, which help them survive in the harsh environment they grow in.

## Care Guide
The Rooted Poppy thrives in full sun and cool conditions, mirroring its arctic origins. It requires well-drained soil that remains consistently moist during its short growing season, but is highly intolerant of waterlogging. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor tundra, fertilization needs are minimal.

### Fertilizer
Low; native soils are nutrient-poor. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer once in spring may be beneficial in cultivated settings, but often not strictly necessary.
