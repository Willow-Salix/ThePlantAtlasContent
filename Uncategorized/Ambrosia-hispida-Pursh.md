## Introduction
In the ancient Greek myths, ambrosia (, Ancient Greek: ἀμβροσία 'immortality') is the food or drink of the Greek gods, and is often depicted as conferring longevity or immortality upon whoever consumed it. It was brought to the gods in Olympus by doves and served either by Hebe or by Ganymede at the heavenly feast.
Ancient art sometimes depicted ambrosia as distributed by the nymph named Ambrosia, a nurse of Dionysus.

## Care Guide
This resilient coastal plant thrives in full sun and very well-draining sandy soil, requiring minimal water once established. It is a low-maintenance species, accustomed to the harsh, nutrient-poor conditions of its native subtropical coastal habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. It is adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils, so minimal or no fertilization is typically required for healthy growth.
