## 🌱 Overview
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sawatch Knotweed requires full to partial sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native montane environment. Provide moderate, consistent moisture throughout the growing season, ensuring excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. It generally has low to moderate fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in naturally occurring organic matter. Light application of a balanced fertilizer may be beneficial, but heavy feeding is not necessary.
