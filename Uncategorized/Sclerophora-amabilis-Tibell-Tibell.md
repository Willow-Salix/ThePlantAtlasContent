## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern Hemisphere temperate to boreal regions, including North America (Pacific Northwest, Alaska), Europe (Scandinavia), and parts of Asia, typically found in old-growth coniferous forests. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool, humid temperate to boreal forest climate, characterized by frequent atmospheric moisture (rain, fog) and significant canopy cover. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate indirect light; thrives in partial to full shade, protected from direct sunlight which can cause desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High ambient humidity is essential. Requires consistent atmospheric moisture, such as frequent misting or a naturally humid environment. Avoid prolonged submersion or standing water, but ensure good air circulation. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sclerophora amabilis requires a consistently cool and humid environment with low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native old-growth forest habitat. Provide ample atmospheric moisture through misting or high ambient humidity, while ensuring good air circulation and absolutely no artificial fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. This lichen is highly sensitive to nutrient enrichment and prefers a clean, unpolluted environment.
