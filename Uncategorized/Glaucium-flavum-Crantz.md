## Care Guide
The Yellow Hornpoppy thrives in full sun and very well-drained, even poor, soil, replicating its native coastal environment. It is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, with minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low nutrient needs; fertilize sparingly, if at all, typically once in spring with a diluted, balanced fertilizer.
