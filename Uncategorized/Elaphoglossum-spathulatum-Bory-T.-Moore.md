## Care Guide
The Antilles Tonguefern thrives in humid, consistently moist environments with low to medium indirect light, mimicking its native rainforest habitat. Ensure excellent drainage and high atmospheric humidity while fertilizing very lightly during warmer months. Protect from direct sun and cold drafts.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize sparingly with a diluted liquid fern or all-purpose fertilizer (1/4 to 1/2 strength) once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer). Excessive fertilization can harm the plant.
