## Introduction
Samolus (known as brookweed, or water pimpernel) is a widely distributed genus of about a dozen species of water-loving herbs and amphibious flowering plants. According to the APG III system of classification, the genus falls within the primrose family, Primulaceae, under the order containing the rhododendroid eudicots, Ericales. It was considered closely related to a clade comprising the Theophrastaceae, and was likewise treated as part of that family (or its own monogeneric family, the Samolaceae). The APG III system does not recognize these families, instead classifying all former Theophrastaceae genera within the family Primulaceae.
