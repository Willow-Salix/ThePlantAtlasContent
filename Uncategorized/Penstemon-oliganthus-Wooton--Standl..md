## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily New Mexico and Arizona) |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Scrubland / Montane Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open native habitat in scrublands and grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, as its native climate experiences periods of drought. Overwatering is detrimental. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil, mirroring its semi-arid mountain origins. Water infrequently once established, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly, and avoid heavy fertilization to prevent leggy growth and promote robust flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low; native soils are often lean. Typically no fertilizer is needed in average garden soil, or a very light, balanced application in early spring if growth is poor.
