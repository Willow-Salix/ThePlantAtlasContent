## 🌱 Overview
Centrosema, the butterfly peas, is a genus of (mainly tropical) American vines in the legume family (Fabaceae). It includes 44 species, which range through the tropical and warm-temperate Americas from the southern United States to northern Argentina. Species include:

Lepidopteran caterpillars that feed on butterfly peas include the two-barred flasher (Astraptes fulgerator), occasionally recorded on C. macrocarpum and C. plumieri at least.
Another plant referred to as butterfly pea from the same subtribe Clitoriinae is the related Clitoria ternatea. However it doesn't belong to the genus Centrosema.
In Jamaica, it is known as Fee Fee and is usually seen at Christmas time. The flower is able to make a whistling sound hence children  usually find it useful as a toy.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical vine thrives in warm, humid conditions with abundant sunlight. Provide consistent moisture and well-draining soil, avoiding waterlogging. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, supplemental nitrogen fertilizer is rarely needed; focus on phosphorus and potassium if soil deficiencies are noted.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so high-nitrogen fertilizers are generally unnecessary. Benefits from phosphorus and potassium, especially in nutrient-poor soils.
