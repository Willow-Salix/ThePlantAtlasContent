## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate and boreal forests/mountainous regions across the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, North America, Asia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forest, often in subalpine/alpine zones, characterized by cool temperatures, moderate to high humidity, and regular precipitation. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to indirect light. Avoid direct, intense sun, which can cause desiccation. Thrives under canopy cover or on north-facing surfaces. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high ambient humidity and regular moisture from precipitation (rain, dew, mist). Needs periods of hydration followed by drying to prevent fungal growth. Do not water like a plant; provide moisture via misting if grown indoors. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lecanora variolascens, a lichen, thrives in cool, humid, and shaded conditions mimicking its temperate and boreal forest origins. It requires high atmospheric moisture, obtained via misting or high ambient humidity, with intermittent drying periods. Fertilizers are detrimental; it obtains all necessary nutrients from the air.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens are sensitive to conventional fertilizers and derive nutrients from the atmosphere and rainwater. Fertilization can be harmful.
