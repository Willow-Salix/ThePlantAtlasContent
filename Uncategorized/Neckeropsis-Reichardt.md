# Neckeropsis Moss

*Neckeropsis Reichardt* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions globally, including Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Often found in humid forest environments. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Moist Subtropical Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light. Thrives in shaded or partially shaded conditions, as it naturally grows on tree trunks, rocks, or forest floors beneath a dense canopy. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and consistent moisture are essential. Keep the substrate or environment consistently damp but never waterlogged. Regular misting is highly beneficial, particularly in drier indoor settings, to mimic its naturally humid habitat. |

## Care Guide
Neckeropsis moss requires high humidity and consistent moisture, mirroring its native tropical forest floor environment. Provide low to medium indirect light, avoiding any direct sun exposure. Fertilization needs are minimal; use a very diluted solution infrequently.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses like Neckeropsis obtain most nutrients from rain and decaying organic matter. If desired, apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) sparingly, no more than once or twice a year during periods of active growth.
