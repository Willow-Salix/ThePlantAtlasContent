## Care Guide
Torrey's Milkvetch is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, reflecting its arid Western U.S. origins. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely, and has minimal fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Mimicking its dry, sunny native environment is key to its successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen and can thrive in lean, poor soils. Fertilization is generally not essential.
