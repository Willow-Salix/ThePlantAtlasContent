## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
Peak Saxifrage thrives in cool, well-drained conditions typical of its native mountainous habitats. Provide bright indirect light to partial sun, consistent moisture with excellent drainage, and very low fertilization to mimic its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilization; use a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer once or twice during the growing season.
