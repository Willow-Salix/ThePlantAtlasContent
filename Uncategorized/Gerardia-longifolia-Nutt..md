## Care Guide
This plant thrives in sunny to partly shaded locations with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native wet prairie and open woodland habitats. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely, and fertilization should be light to moderate, as it's adapted to natural nutrient cycles and can be hemiparasitic.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in moderately fertile soils. Heavy fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
