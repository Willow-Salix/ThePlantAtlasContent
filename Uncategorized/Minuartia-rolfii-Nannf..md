## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic regions of Europe (Svalbard, Northern Scandinavia including Norway, Sweden, Finland) and North America (Greenland). |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. This plant is adapted to long hours of daylight during the short Arctic summer and open, exposed habitats without tree canopy. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture during its brief growing season, typically from meltwater, but requires excellent drainage as native soils can be waterlogged due to permafrost but also subject to rapid drying on the surface. |

## Introduction
Minuartia is a genus of flowering plants commonly known as sandworts in the family Caryophyllaceae.
Minuartias are small annual or perennial plants which grow in otherwise inhospitable conditions such as on rocky ledges and in stony soil. Species are distributed in Eurasia and parts of Africa, including Europe, the Mediterranean region, northern and eastern Africa, the Caucasus, western and central Asia, Japan, and Far Eastern Russia.
Many Minuartia species were formerly classed in the genus Arenaria, and the obsolete genus Alsine. In 2014, the polyphyletic Minuartia sensu lato was recircumscribed, with many of the species transferred to other genera, including Cherleria, Eremogone, Facchinia, Mcneillia, Minuartiella, Mononeuria, Pseudocherleria, Rhodalsine, Sabulina, and Triplateia. Minuartia sensu stricto is characterized by the following features: leaves linear-setaceous; 5 acute sepals with 3, 5, or 9-veins; 5 white petals; 3 styles, forming 3-parted capsules.
The genus was named for Juan Minuart (1693–1768), a Spanish botanist and pharmacist.

## Care Guide
Minuartia rolfii Nannf. thrives in cold, exposed Arctic environments. Provide full sun and consistent, but well-drained, moisture during its short growing season. Minimal to no fertilization is required.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Tundra soils are naturally nutrient-poor, so this plant is adapted to minimal nutrient availability. Avoid over-fertilization.
