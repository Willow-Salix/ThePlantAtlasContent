## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Asia (South Korea, Japan, parts of China) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers low to medium indirect light; can tolerate some morning sun but avoid harsh afternoon sun to prevent leaf scorch. Mimics the understory conditions of its native forest habitat. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, but not waterlogged. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry, allowing excess water to drain. Its native forest floor environment provides steady moisture. |

## Introduction
Polystichum is a genus of ferns in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). The genus has about 500 species and has a cosmopolitan distribution. The highest diversity is in eastern Asia, with about 208 species in China alone; the region from Mexico to Brazil has at least 100 additional species; Africa (at least 17 species), North America (at least 18 species), and Europe (at least 5 species) have much lower diversity. Polystichum species are terrestrial or rock-dwelling ferns of warm-temperate and montane-tropical regions (a few species grow in alpine regions). They are often found in disturbed habitats such as road cuts, talus slopes, and stream banks.

## Care Guide
The Korean Rock Fern thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil and low to medium indirect light, mimicking its native forest understory. Protect it from direct sun and provide regular watering to maintain soil moisture without waterlogging. Fertilize sparingly during the growing months for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a diluted balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer). As a fern in a forest environment, it's accustomed to nutrient-rich but not overly fertilized soil.
