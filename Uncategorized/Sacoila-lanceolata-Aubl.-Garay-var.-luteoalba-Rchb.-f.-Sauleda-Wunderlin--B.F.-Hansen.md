## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida), Cuba, Bahamas, and other Caribbean islands |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical, characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons, often found in open pinelands, savannas, or prairies. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, filtered light to partial direct sun. This plant thrives in open, sunny locations in its native habitat, tolerating more direct sun than many other orchids, especially during cooler parts of the day. |
| **Watering** | Water frequently and thoroughly during the active growing season (mimicking the wet season), allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Significantly reduce watering during the cooler, drier dormant period to prevent rot. |

## Introduction
Sacoila is a genus of flowering plants from the orchid family, Orchidaceae, native to the Western Hemisphere. It occurs in Mexico, Central America, South America, the West Indies and Florida.

## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid requires bright light, consistent moisture during its growing season, and excellent drainage to mimic its native open, subtropical environment. Reduce watering and fertilizer significantly during its dormant period to promote healthy cycles. Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient. Apply a balanced liquid orchid fertilizer at a dilute strength (e.g., half strength) every 2-4 weeks during the active growth period. Reduce or cease fertilization during dormancy.
