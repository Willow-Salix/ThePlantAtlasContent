## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Grassland with Vernal Pools |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. As an annual growing in open grassland and vernal pool environments, it requires direct sunlight during its active growth phase. |
| **Watering** | Abundant water during its active growing season (late winter to late spring), mimicking the inundation of vernal pools. Allow the soil to dry out significantly or completely during the summer months as it completes its annual life cycle. |

## Introduction
Streptanthus is a genus of plants within the family Brassicaceae. There are 56 known species within the genus Streptanthus, distributed through the western and south-central United States and northern Mexico. The common names for this genus are twistflower and jewelflower.

## Care Guide
Hammitt's claycress requires a distinct seasonal care strategy, needing full sun and plentiful water from late winter through late spring to simulate its native vernal pool habitat. It thrives in clay-rich soils that experience seasonal inundation followed by a complete dry period, reflecting its annual growth cycle.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native vernal pool soils are often nutrient-poor. A light application of balanced fertilizer during its active growth phase may be beneficial, but heavy feeding is likely unnecessary.
