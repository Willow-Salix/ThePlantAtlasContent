## 🌱 Overview
Micranthes is a genus of flowering plants in the saxifrage family. It was formerly included within the genus Saxifraga until DNA evidence from 1996 showed the members of what is now Micranthes are more closely related to Boykinia and Heuchera than to other members of the genus Saxifraga.
All members of this genus are herbaceous, with prominent basal leaves. They are found in temperate, arctic, and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in cool, moist conditions with bright, indirect light or partial sun. Ensure consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native habitat near snowmelt and stream banks. Fertilize lightly during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; a diluted balanced liquid fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient for its naturally lean, rocky habitat.
