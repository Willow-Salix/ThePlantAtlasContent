## Introduction
Phlox (; Ancient Greek: φλόξ "flame"; plural "phlox" or "phloxes", Ancient Greek: φλόγες phlóges) is a genus of 68 species of perennial and annual plants in the family Polemoniaceae.

## Care Guide
This hardy prairie native flourishes in full sun and requires well-drained soil. While tolerant of some drought once mature, it performs best with consistent moisture during its growing season. Avoid excessive fertilization to promote robust flowering and compact growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in average to lean soil. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost once a year is usually sufficient if needed.
