## Care Guide
This rock-loving plant thrives in conditions mimicking its arid, rocky native habitat. Provide abundant sunlight and allow the soil to dry thoroughly between very infrequent waterings. Fertilization is rarely needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and over-fertilization can be detrimental.
