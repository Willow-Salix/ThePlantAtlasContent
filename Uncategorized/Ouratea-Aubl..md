## Introduction
Ouratea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ochnaceae. It includes over 290 species native to the tropical Americas, from Mexico and Cuba to southern Brazil, to Cameroon and Gabon in West-Central Africa, and to Ascension Island in the South Atlantic. Most species are native to the Americas. There are two African species, Ouratea batesii and Ouratea stenophylla, and Ouratea lessonii is endemic to Ascension.

## Care Guide
Ouratea plants thrive in conditions mirroring their native tropical rainforests, requiring consistent soil moisture and bright, indirect light. High humidity is crucial, and they benefit from moderate fertilization during active growth, while needing protection from harsh direct sun.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer. Avoid over-fertilization.
