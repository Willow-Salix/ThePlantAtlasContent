## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States, Mexico, Mediterranean Europe, and North Africa |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-arid Scrubland and Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure, often thriving in full sun on exposed rock surfaces, though tolerant of some partial shade. |
| **Watering** | Extremely infrequent watering, relying on occasional rainfall, dew, or fog. Highly drought tolerant due to its poikilohydric nature. |

## Introduction
Diploschistes is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Graphidaceae. Commonly known as crater lichens, members of the genus are crustose lichens with a thick, cracked (areolate) body (thallus) with worldwide distribution. The fruiting part (apothecia) are immersed in the thick thallus so as to have the appearance of being small "craters". The widespread genus contains about 43 species.

## Care Guide
This saxicolous lichen is adapted to arid to semi-arid climates on calcareous rocks, needing high light exposure and extremely infrequent watering. No fertilization is required, as it obtains nutrients naturally from its environment, making it a very low-maintenance organism.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens do not require traditional fertilization, absorbing trace nutrients from the air and substrate.
