## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic North America (including Alaska, Canada, Greenland) and parts of Siberia |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra, Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, reflecting its open, exposed native habitat with minimal tree cover during the short growing season. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture during the active growth period, but critically requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot in cold conditions. Tolerates very dry conditions during dormant, frozen periods. |

## Introduction
Braya is a genus of plants in the family Brassicaceae. It includes 22 species native to subarctic and subalpine Eurasia and North America.

## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine plant thrives in full sun and needs consistent moisture with excellent drainage during its brief growing season. Fertilization should be minimal due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor tundra soils. Ensure a cold, dormant period for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is needed. If used, apply a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly once during the growing season, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, shallow soils.
