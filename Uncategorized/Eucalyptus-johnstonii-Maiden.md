## Care Guide
Johnston's Gum thrives in full sun with consistent moisture, replicating its native cool temperate forest environment. It prefers well-draining soil and typically requires minimal fertilization, reflecting its adaptation to less fertile Australian soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Eucalypts are generally adapted to nutrient-poor soils; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly, if at all, during the growing season.
