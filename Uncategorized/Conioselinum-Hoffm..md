## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Hemisphere, including North America (especially northern and western regions), Northern Europe, and temperate to subarctic Asia (e.g., Siberia, East Asia, Himalayas). |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forests, Subalpine Meadows, and Moist Tundra margins. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to full sun, thriving best with consistent moisture. In hotter climates, protection from intense afternoon sun is beneficial. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering is essential to maintain consistently moist soil, mimicking its native habitat along stream banks and moist meadows. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Conioselinum is a genus of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae, native to Eurasia and North America. Its species are erect perennial plants with deeply toothed compound leaves and umbels of white flowers. Plants of this genus are known commonly as hemlock-parsley.

## Care Guide
Hemlockparsley thrives in cool, consistently moist environments, preferring conditions similar to its native temperate to subarctic habitats. It requires regular watering to keep the soil moist and performs best in partial to full sun, ideally with some afternoon shade in warmer regions. Moderate fertilization supports healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied annually in spring, or a diluted liquid fertilizer monthly during the growing season, should suffice. Native soils are often organically rich.
