## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (endemic) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade, mimicking its native understory or mid-canopy forest environment. Avoid harsh, direct afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, allowing the top inch to dry slightly between waterings. Requires regular watering due to its native wet forest habitat. |

## Introduction
Melicope is a genus of about 240 species of shrubs and trees in the family Rutaceae, occurring from the Hawaiian Islands across the Pacific Ocean to tropical Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Plants in the genus Melicope have simple or trifoliate leaves arranged in opposite pairs, flowers arranged in panicles, with four sepals, four petals and four or eight stamens and fruit composed of up to four follicles.

## Care Guide
Mokihana thrives in conditions similar to its native Hawaiian wet forests, requiring bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide moderate humidity and fertilize sparingly during active growth to support its development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer) is sufficient, reflecting the nutrient cycling in its natural forest soil.
