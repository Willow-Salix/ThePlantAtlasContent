## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fanpetals thrive in warm, sunny conditions mimicking their native tropical and subtropical habitats. Provide regular water during growth, allowing the soil to dry slightly, and use fertilizer sparingly as they are not heavy feeders. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season, or less if grown in rich soil.
