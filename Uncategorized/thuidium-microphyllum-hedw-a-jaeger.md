## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in consistently moist, humid environments with low to medium, indirect light, mimicking its native forest floor habitat. It requires regular watering to keep the substrate damp and benefits greatly from high ambient humidity. Fertilization is rarely, if ever, needed due to its low nutrient demands.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally no fertilizer is needed. Mosses have low nutrient requirements and can be harmed by excessive feeding.
