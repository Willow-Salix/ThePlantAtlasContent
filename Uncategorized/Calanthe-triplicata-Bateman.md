## Care Guide
The Christmas Orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical rainforest floor habitat, requiring consistent moisture, high humidity, and bright, indirect light. Plant in a well-draining medium and provide light fertilization during its growing period to encourage healthy development.
