## Care Guide
African daisies thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking their native Mediterranean climate in South Africa. They are relatively drought-tolerant once established, preferring moderate watering and requiring only light fertilization to encourage their vibrant blooms. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly, primarily during the blooming season, as native soils are not typically overly rich.
