## 🌱 Overview
Opegrapha is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Opegraphaceae. These lichens form crusty patches on bark, rock, or other lichens, and are easily recognized by their distinctive black, slit-like or rounded fruiting bodies that look like tiny scribbles or dashes on the surface. The genus includes more than 100 species found worldwide, with most partnering with orange-pigmented green algae, though some live as parasites on other lichens.

It prefers partial to full shade, avoiding direct sunlight which can lead to desiccation. No traditional fertilization is needed as it absorbs all necessary nutrients from the air and rain.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; nutrients are absorbed from air and rain.
