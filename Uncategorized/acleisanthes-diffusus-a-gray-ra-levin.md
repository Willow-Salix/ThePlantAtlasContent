| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure is essential, mimicking its native open desert and grassland habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, deep watering is preferred. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Acleisanthes is a genus of flowering plants in the Bougainvillea family, Nyctaginaceae. There are currently 16 species. The generic name is derived from the Greek words ακλειοτος (akleistos), meaning "not closed", and ανθος (anthos), meaning "flower". Plants of this genus are known commonly as trumpets due to the elongated, open-ended shape of their flowers. These are arid-adapted perennials with thick taproots which are usually compact and low to the ground or slightly ascending. An individual plant may have cleistogamous (unopening and self-pollinating) flowers as well as opening flowers which are usually nocturnal as a water-saving adaptation and are pollinated by night-flying or crepuscular insects such as hawkmoths. Flowers are usually white, sometimes yellow. These plants are native to the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts of Mexico and the United States.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water due to its desert origins. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot, and fertilizer needs are very low. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is needed. If used, apply a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly once a year in spring.
