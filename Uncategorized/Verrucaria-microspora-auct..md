## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of Europe and North America, specifically on rocks in or near freshwater bodies. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Riparian (riverbank) and Lacustrine (lake-side) environments, characterized by consistent moisture. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers low to moderate indirect light; often found submerged or in shaded, damp locations. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant moisture or periodic inundation, mimicking its natural habitat on submerged or regularly wetted rocks. |

## Introduction
Verrucaria is a genus of lichenized (lichen-forming) fungi in the family Verrucariaceae. These lichens form crust-like growths on rocks, particularly limestone and other calcareous surfaces, though some species also grow on siliceous rock or occasionally on bark and soil. The genus includes both terrestrial species found in dry environments and marine species that can survive periodic flooding or permanent submersion in coastal and freshwater habitats. With about 150 accepted species worldwide, Verrucaria represents a challenging taxonomic group due to overlapping physical characteristics and the polyphyletic nature of the genus.

## Care Guide
This aquatic/semi-aquatic lichen thrives in consistently moist or submerged conditions with low to moderate indirect light. Nutrient requirements are minimal, reflecting its natural habitat on rocks in freshwater.

### Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer requirements; lichens thrive on minimal ambient nutrients from their environment.
