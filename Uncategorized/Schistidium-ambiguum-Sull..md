## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (eastern and central United States, Canada), Europe |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest and Rocky Outcrops |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to partial shade. While it can tolerate some exposure, it prefers locations with some protection from intense, prolonged direct sunlight to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial for active growth, absorbing water directly through its leaves. It tolerates short dry periods but thrives with high ambient humidity or regular misting. Avoid prolonged waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
Schistidium ambiguum, a temperate moss, thrives in partial sun to partial shade with consistent moisture and high ambient humidity. It requires very little, if any, supplemental nutrients, absorbing what it needs from its environment and a suitable substrate like rock or soil.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses are highly efficient at nutrient absorption from rainwater and their substrate; supplemental fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
