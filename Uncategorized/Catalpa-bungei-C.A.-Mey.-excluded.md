## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern and Northeastern China (e.g., Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, Shandong, Shanxi provinces) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest / Continental climate with distinct seasons |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for best growth and flowering, similar to open forest or riverbank exposure in native habitat). |
| **Watering** | Moderate to high. Requires regular watering, especially during dry periods and establishment, mimicking the moderate rainfall patterns of its temperate native regions. Ensure well-drained soil to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
The Manchurian Catalpa, adapted to temperate climates, requires full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Water regularly, especially when young, and fertilize sparingly in spring if soil nutrients are lacking. This hardy tree tolerates urban conditions and some drought once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in fertile, well-drained soils. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, particularly if soil is poor, reflecting the natural nutrient cycling in its native temperate forest environment.
