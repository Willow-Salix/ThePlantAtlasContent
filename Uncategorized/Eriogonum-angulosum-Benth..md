## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (primarily Central Valley and surrounding foothills) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Arid Scrubland/Grassland) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), thrives in open, exposed areas typical of its native scrubland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low to infrequent; once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal supplemental water, especially during its dormant summer period. Overwatering can be detrimental. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
Anglestem Buckwheat is a resilient native plant requiring full sun and very little water once established, thriving on infrequent watering during its active growing season. It prefers well-draining, poor soils and typically does not need fertilization. Mimic its native arid scrubland environment for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low; this plant is adapted to poor, rocky, or sandy soils and generally does not require fertilization. Over-fertilization can harm the plant.
