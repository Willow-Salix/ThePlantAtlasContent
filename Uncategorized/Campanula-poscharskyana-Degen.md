## Introduction
Campanula () is the type genus of the Campanulaceae family of flowering plants. Campanula are commonly known as bellflowers and take both their common and scientific names from the bell-shaped flowers—campanula is Latin for "little bell".
The genus includes over 500 species and several subspecies, distributed across the temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with centers of diversity in the Mediterranean region, Balkans, Caucasus and mountains of western Asia. The range also extends into mountains in tropical regions of Asia and Africa.

The species include annual, biennial and perennial plants, and vary in habit from dwarf arctic and alpine species under 5 cm high, to large temperate grassland and woodland species growing to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall.

## Care Guide
This resilient perennial thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, ideal for rocky gardens or containers. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and fertilize sparingly in spring. Its hardiness and adaptability make it a low-maintenance choice.

### Fertilizer
Low. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is generally sufficient, or none if planted in reasonably fertile soil.
