## Introduction
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## Care Guide
This arctic/alpine moss thrives in cool, consistently moist environments with indirect or diffused light. It has very low nutrient needs, preferring nutrient-poor substrates. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging while maintaining high humidity.

### Fertilizer
Low nutrient requirements; fertilizer is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental. Thrives in nutrient-poor substrates.
