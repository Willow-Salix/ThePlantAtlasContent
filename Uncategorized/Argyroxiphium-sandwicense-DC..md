## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (specifically high-elevation slopes of Haleakalā on Maui, and Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa on Hawaiʻi Island) |
| **Climate** | High-elevation Subalpine/Alpine Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full, intense direct sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily, mimicking high-altitude exposure above the cloud layer. It thrives in high UV environments. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent but deep watering. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires extremely sharp drainage to prevent root rot, as it is adapted to porous volcanic cinder and low rainfall. |

## Introduction
Argyroxiphium is a small genus of plants in the family Asteraceae. Its members are known by the common names silversword or greensword due to their long, narrow leaves and the silvery hairs on some species. The silverswords belong to a larger radiation of over 50 species, including the physically different genera Dubautia and Wilkesia. This grouping is often referred to as the silversword alliance. Botanist P. H. Raven referred to this radiation as "the best example of adaptive radiation in plants".

## Care Guide
The Hawai'i Silversword thrives in intense direct sunlight and requires very well-draining soil, mimicking its native high-altitude volcanic environment. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization. It is adapted to dry conditions and susceptible to root rot in humid or waterlogged environments.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Native soils are nutrient-poor; excessive fertilization can be detrimental. If absolutely necessary, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly once a year in spring.
