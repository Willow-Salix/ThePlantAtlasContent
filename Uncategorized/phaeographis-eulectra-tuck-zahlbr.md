## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a lichen, Phaeographis eulectra thrives in very high humidity and filtered light conditions. It requires frequent moisture from its environment, such as rain or mist, and should never be allowed to dry out for extended periods. No traditional fertilization is needed, as it gathers nutrients from the air and its host surface.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers; obtains nutrients from airborne particles, rain, and its substrate (tree bark). Sensitive to pollution.
