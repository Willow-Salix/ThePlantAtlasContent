## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic regions, including Greenland, Svalbard, Northern Canada, Alaska, Siberia, and Northern Europe. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring cool, bright conditions. It is exposed to continuous daylight during the short arctic summer but benefits from cooler temperatures. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimic meltwater conditions, ensuring the soil does not dry out but also avoids waterlogging. Reduced watering in winter if dormant. |

## Introduction
Cerastium is a genus of annual, winter annual, or perennial flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. They are commonly called mouse-ears or mouse-ear chickweeds. There are 214 accepted species, found nearly worldwide but with the greatest concentration in the northern temperate regions. A number of the species are common weeds in fields and on disturbed ground.

Cerastium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora chalcogrammella (which feeds exclusively on Cerastium arvense) and Coleophora striatipennella (which has been recorded on Cerastium fontanum).

## Care Guide
This Arctic tundra plant thrives in cool temperatures and full, but not intensely hot, sunlight. It requires consistently moist, well-drained, and low-nutrient soils, mirroring its native habitat where it endures long, cold winters and short, cool, moist summers.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor tundra soils and excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
