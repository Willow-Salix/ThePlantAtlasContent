## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | High mountains of Colorado, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to very high light exposure, as it naturally grows above the treeline in open, exposed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture during its short growing season (spring/summer), but critically requires extremely sharp drainage to prevent root rot, mimicking rocky alpine soils. |

## 🌱 Overview
Draba is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, commonly known as whitlow-grasses (though they are not related to the true grasses).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Weber's Draba thrives in conditions that mimic its native alpine tundra. Provide full sun and ensure exceptionally well-draining, lean soil to prevent waterlogging. Water consistently during the active growing period, but avoid over-fertilization as it is adapted to low nutrient environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky alpine soils; rich soil or excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
