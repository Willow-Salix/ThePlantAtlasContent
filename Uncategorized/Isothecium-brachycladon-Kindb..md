## Care Guide
This moss thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate, humid forest floor. Provide low, indirect light, ensure the substrate remains consistently moist, and maintain high atmospheric humidity to support its growth. Fertilization is generally not necessary.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; mosses typically derive nutrients from rain, dust, and decaying organic matter.
