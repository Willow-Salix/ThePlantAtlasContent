## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA and Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, ideally with morning sun and some afternoon shade in hotter climates, or full sun in milder areas. Requires bright light during its active growing season. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growth period from late winter through spring, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Crucially, keep the soil dry during its summer dormancy to prevent rot. |

## Introduction
Triteleia is a genus of monocotyledon flowering plants also known as triplet lilies. The 16 species are native to western North America, from British Columbia south to California and east to Wyoming and Arizona, with one species in northwestern Mexico. However, they are most common in California. They are perennial plants growing from a fibrous corm roughly spherical in shape. They get their name from the fact that all parts of their flowers come in threes.

## Care Guide
Thriving in a Mediterranean climate, this plant prefers full sun to partial shade during its active growing season in spring. Provide moderate water during this period, then ensure a dry dormancy through the summer months to mimic its native conditions. Fertilization should be minimal, supporting growth without over-enriching the soil.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring as new growth emerges. Avoid heavy feeding, as these plants are adapted to leaner soils.
