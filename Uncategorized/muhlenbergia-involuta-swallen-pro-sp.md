## 🧤 Care Instructions
This muhly grass thrives in conditions mimicking its native montane savannas, requiring ample sunlight and well-drained soil. Water moderately during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and fertilize sparingly. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot, especially during cooler or dormant periods.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring, or minimal liquid feeding during the growing season in poorer soils.
