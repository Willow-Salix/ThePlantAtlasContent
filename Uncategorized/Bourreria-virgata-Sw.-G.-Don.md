## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caribbean (e.g., Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico) and Mesoamerica (e.g., Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras), extending into northern South America. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest and Subtropical Dry Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun exposure for optimal growth, tolerating light partial shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the active growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. Reduce watering significantly during cooler or dormant periods to simulate its native dry season. |

## Introduction
Bourreria is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as strongbark or strongback. The generic name was chosen by Patrick Browne to honour German pharmacist Johann Ambrosius Beurer. The genus is native to the tropical Americas and to eastern Africa and Madagascar. American species are distributed from Mexico to northern South America, and in the Caribbean and Florida in the United States. The center of diversity is in the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico. The eastern African species range from Ethiopia to Mozambique and to Madagascar, the Comoro Islands, and Mauritius.

## Care Guide
This resilient tree thrives in full sun with well-draining soil, mimicking its native tropical dry forest conditions. Water moderately during its active growth, allowing for dry spells, and reduce watering during cooler periods. Provide a light, balanced fertilizer to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season. It is adapted to moderately fertile soils and does not require heavy feeding.
