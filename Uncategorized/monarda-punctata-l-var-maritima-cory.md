## 🌱 Overview
Monarda is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. The genus is endemic to North America. Common names include bergamot, bee balm, horsemint, and oswego tea, the first being inspired by the fragrance of the leaves, which is reminiscent of bergamot orange (Citrus bergamia). The genus was named for the Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes, who wrote a book in 1574 describing plants of the New World.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soil, mimicking its native coastal plain habitat. It is quite drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and little to no fertilization. Ensure good air circulation to prevent powdery mildew.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; it is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring, but it often thrives without much feeding.
