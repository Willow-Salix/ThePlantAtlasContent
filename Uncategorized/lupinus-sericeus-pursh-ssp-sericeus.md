## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including parts of Canada (British Columbia) and the United States (from California north to Washington, and east to the Dakotas and Nebraska). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland, Semi-Arid Steppe, and Montane/Subalpine zones, often found in open fields, prairies, and forest clearings. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is ideal, mimicking its native exposed habitats. It can tolerate light partial shade, but flowering may be reduced. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established due to adaptation to dry native climates. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Silky Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its native temperate grassland and semi-arid conditions. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, no additional fertilizer is typically needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer is needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen in the soil, enriching it naturally. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers which can inhibit flowering.
