## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Africa (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe) |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland/Dry Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure is preferred, thriving in bright, direct light for most of the day, consistent with open savanna conditions. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently during the active growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly during cooler or dormant periods, as it is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Bauhinia () is a large genus of flowering plants in the subfamily Cercidoideae and tribe Bauhinieae, in the large flowering plant family Fabaceae, with a pantropical distribution. The genus was named after the Bauhin brothers Gaspard and Johann, Swiss-French botanists.
Many species are widely planted in the tropics as orchid trees, particularly in India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Nepal and south-eastern China. Other common names include mountain ebony and kachnar.  Before the family was reorganised, a number of genera including the lianas of genus Phanera were placed here (see related genera).
In the United States, the trees grow in Hawaii, coastal California, Arizona, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. There are native species, like Bauhinia lunarioides native to Texas and widely planted in the Southwest as a landscape plant.
Parts of some species of bauhinia like B. purpurea and B. malabarica are used in Filipino cuisine (known collectively as alinbánban or alinbángbang, "butterfly").
Bauhinia × blakeana is the floral emblem of Hong Kong—a stylized orchid tree flower appears on the flag of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Airlines (formerly CR Airways) uses 'Bauhinia' as its radio callsign in air traffic communication.

## Care Guide
To care for Camel's Foot, provide ample full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid environment. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and use fertilizer sparingly. It is a resilient plant, well-suited for xeriscaping or conditions with minimal intervention.

### Fertilizer
Requires low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied once or twice during the growing season is generally sufficient, especially given its adaptation to nutrient-poor sandy soils.
