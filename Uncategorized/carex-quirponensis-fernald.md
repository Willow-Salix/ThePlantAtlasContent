## 🧤 Care Instructions
This sedge thrives in consistently wet soil, mimicking its native bog and marsh environment. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil never dries out. It has low to moderate nutrient needs, so avoid over-fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as many bog and marsh soils are naturally poor to moderately rich in nutrients.
