## Care Guide
This epiphytic orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical cloud forests, requiring bright, indirect light and consistently high humidity. Maintain continuous moisture in the growing medium, ensuring good drainage, and feed lightly with a diluted orchid fertilizer during active growth. Good air circulation is essential to prevent fungal issues.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Apply a highly diluted (e.g., quarter strength), balanced orchid fertilizer solution weekly to bi-weekly during active growth periods.
