## Care Guide
This tree thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established, mirroring its Mediterranean origins. Provide moderate water during the growing season and fertilize sparingly, especially in well-drained, average soils, to maintain its health and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization needs, thriving in average to poor soils. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can benefit young trees or those in very lean soils.
