## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America (widespread across Canada and the United States) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie, Subalpine Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its native open grassland and meadow habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate; allow soil to dry slightly between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to periods of lower rainfall in its native range. |

## 🌱 Overview
Elymus trachycaulus is a species of wild rye known by the common name slender wheatgrass. It is native to much of North America.  It grows in widely varied habitats from northern Canada to Mexico, but is absent from most of the southeastern United States.
It is variable in appearance, but generally bears a very narrow, linear inflorescence of spikelets appressed against the stem. There are three subspecies, two very widespread and one which is limited to Greenland.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Slender Wheatgrass is a robust, low-maintenance grass that prefers full sun and well-drained soil. It is very adaptable and drought-tolerant once established, requiring only moderate watering during dry spells and minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; can thrive in average to poor soils. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring is only necessary if soil fertility is very low.
