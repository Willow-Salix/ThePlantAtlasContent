## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Sonoran Desert (southern Arizona, USA; Baja California, Baja California Sur, and Sonora, Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Arid Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires direct, intense sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily. |
| **Watering** | Extremely infrequent; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water deeply but rarely during the growing season (spring/summer) and much less or not at all during dormancy (fall/winter). |

## Introduction
Stenocereus thurberi, the organ pipe cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and the United States. The species is found in rocky desert. Two subspecies are recognized based on their distribution and height. The Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is named for the species. Cacti are minimally adapted to particular thermal niches, and are tremendously vulnerable to seasonal precipitation.
Its English common name is derived from its resemblance to a pipe organ. It is locally known as pitaya dulce, Spanish for "sweet pitaya" or sweet cactus fruit.

## Care Guide
To mimic its arid desert origin, provide Organ Pipe Cactus with abundant direct sunlight and extremely well-draining soil. Water very infrequently, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings, and fertilize lightly only during its active growth period. Ensure protection from frost as it is not cold-hardy.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; feed sparingly with a diluted, balanced cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer). Desert soils are naturally low in nutrients.
