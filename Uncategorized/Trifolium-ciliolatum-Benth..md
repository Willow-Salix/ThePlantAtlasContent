## Introduction
Trifolium ciliolatum is a species of clover known by the common name foothill clover. It is native to western North America from Washington to Baja California.
It is a common plant of many regions, including disturbed habitat.
It is an annual herb growing erect in form, with hairless herbage. The leaves are made up of toothed oval leaflets and have bristle-tipped stipules. The inflorescence is a head of flowers 1 or 2 centimeters wide, the flowers often spreading out or drooping. The flower has a calyx of bristle-like sepals lined with hairs and a pinkish or purplish corolla.

## Care Guide
Foothill clover thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions typical of its native Mediterranean climate, adapted to wet winters and dry summers. Provide moderate water during its active growing season and very little fertilizer, especially nitrogen, as it fixes its own.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs, particularly for nitrogen, due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume. Supplement with a balanced, low-dose fertilizer only if growth appears significantly stunted.
