## Care Guide
Marah Kellogg, or Manroot, thrives in a Mediterranean climate, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistent moisture during its winter-spring growth. It is essential to allow the plant to experience a dry, dormant period in summer, and it generally requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring, but it's often not necessary as the plant is adapted to leaner soils.
