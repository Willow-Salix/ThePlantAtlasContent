## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | St. Lawrence Estuary, Quebec, Canada |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coastal Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, as it naturally grows in open, unsheltered tidal flats. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native brackish tidal flat and marsh habitat. The soil should never be allowed to dry out, and it tolerates periodic inundation. |

## Introduction
Gentianopsis is a genus of flowering plants in the gentian family known commonly as fringed gentians. These are similar to the gentians of genus Gentiana. Most have flowers which are blue to purple in color. They may be annual or perennial. They are native to Eurasia and temperate North America.

## Care Guide
Victorin's Gentian is a unique plant demanding full sun and perpetually wet, well-drained soil, ideally with a brackish component to replicate its specialized St. Lawrence Estuary habitat. Careful management of constant moisture without stagnation, along with low to moderate nutrient levels, is essential for its challenging cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It thrives in soils that are not overly rich. A light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring should suffice, as excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
