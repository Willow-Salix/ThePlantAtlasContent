## Care Guide
This ephemeral plant thrives in full sun during its brief spring growth period, requiring consistent moisture. Once summer's heat and dryness arrive, it enters dormancy, needing little to no water. It prefers well-draining soil and has low to moderate fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced fertilizer once during early spring growth, if soils are poor. Generally not a heavy feeder.
