| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and alpine regions, including Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, Finland), northern Europe, Greenland, and arctic North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | High light exposure, tolerating direct sun, characteristic of open rocky habitats in cold regions. Requires very cold temperatures to thrive. |
| **💧 Water** | Irregular moisture from atmospheric sources (rain, snowmelt, fog, dew), with periods of complete desiccation. Cannot tolerate prolonged wetness or submersion. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen requires extremely cold, exposed conditions with high light. It thrives on nutrient-poor rock surfaces, absorbing moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere. Ensure periods of dryness between infrequent atmospheric wetting, and avoid any form of fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient requirements. Grows on nutrient-poor siliceous rock; no fertilization is needed or recommended, as it would likely be detrimental.
