## Care Guide
The Sickletop Lousewort thrives in cool, moist, well-drained conditions found in montane to subalpine forests. Provide partial sun to dappled shade and ensure consistent moisture, avoiding waterlogging. It requires very little to no supplemental fertilizer due to its hemiparasitic nature.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. As a hemiparasitic plant, excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
