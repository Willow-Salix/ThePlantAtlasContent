## Care Guide
Timmiella moss thrives in bright, direct sunlight and prefers dry conditions, indicative of its natural rocky and exposed habitats. Water infrequently, allowing the substrate to thoroughly dry out between applications. Fertilization is generally not necessary, as it adapts well to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses typically require minimal nutrients and can thrive in poor, mineral-rich substrates like calcareous rocks and dry soil.
