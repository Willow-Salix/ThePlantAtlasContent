## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northeastern Mexico (Nuevo León, Coahuila, Zacatecas) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-Arid Montane Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with its open, high-altitude native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between applications. It is drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to semi-arid conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
A pine is any conifer in the genus Pinus () of the family Pinaceae. Pinus is the sole genus in the subfamily Pinoideae. The species are evergreen trees or shrubs with their leaves in bunches, usually of 2 to 5 needles. The seeds are carried on woody cones, with two seeds to each cone scale.
Pines are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere; they occupy large areas of taiga (boreal forest), but are found in many habitats, including the Mediterranean Basin, and dry tropical forests in southeast Asia and Central America. Some are fire-resistant or fire-dependent. 
Pine trees provide one of the most extensively used types of timber. The seeds are used to make dishes such as pesto, while retsina wine is flavoured with pine resin.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Johann's Pine thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soil, mirroring its native semi-arid montane environment. Water sparingly, allowing significant drying between applications, and fertilize lightly. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root issues and promote robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it naturally grows in rocky, often nutrient-poor montane soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if planted in a good substrate.
