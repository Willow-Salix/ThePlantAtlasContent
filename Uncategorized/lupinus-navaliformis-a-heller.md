## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soil, characteristic of Mediterranean chaparral environments. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering primarily during its cooler growing seasons. Avoid over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen, to promote healthy growth and blooming.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally does not require supplemental nitrogen. Well-draining, somewhat poor soil is preferred; rich soil can sometimes hinder flowering.
