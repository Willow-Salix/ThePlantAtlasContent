## Care Guide
Nierembergia viscosa thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native subtropical grassland environment. It requires regular watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growing period. This care strategy ensures vigorous growth and prolific flowering.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Fertilize every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer.
