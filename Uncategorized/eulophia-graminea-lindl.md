## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia (e.g., Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines), Southern China, Taiwan, and extending to parts of Oceania (e.g., New Guinea, Northern Australia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Monsoon/Savanna, characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons, often found in open grasslands, forest edges, and disturbed areas. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. It thrives in conditions where it receives several hours of direct morning sun or filtered bright light throughout the day, avoiding intense midday sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Water regularly during its active growth period, allowing the potting medium to dry out slightly between waterings, mimicking the wet season. Reduce watering frequency significantly during cooler or dormant periods, allowing the medium to dry more thoroughly, to simulate the dry season. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eulophia, commonly known as corduroy orchids, is a genus of about two hundred species of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. Most Eulophia orchids are terrestrial but some are deciduous while others are evergreen. They either have an underground rhizome or pseudobulbs on the surface and those species with leaves have them on the end of a fleshy stem. The flowers are arranged on a thin flowering spike, the flowers having sepals which are larger than the petals. The genus is widely distributed but most species are found in Africa and Asia, usually growing in shady places with grass or shrubs in forests.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Eulophia graminea prefers bright, indirect light to partial sun conditions, reflecting its native open habitats. Water consistently during active growth, allowing for slight drying between applications, and reduce watering when dormant to mimic its native wet and dry seasons. Provide good drainage and fertilize sparingly with a diluted orchid fertilizer during its growth phase.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Apply a balanced, diluted orchid-specific fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) every 2-4 weeks during its active growth phase. Reduce or cease fertilization during its dormant period.
