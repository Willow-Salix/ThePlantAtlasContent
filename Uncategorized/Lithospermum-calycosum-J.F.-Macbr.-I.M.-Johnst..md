## Care Guide
Chinati Stoneseed thrives in bright, full sun conditions and requires excellent drainage, typical of its arid montane desert origin. Water deeply but infrequently, ensuring the soil dries completely between waterings to prevent root rot. It needs minimal fertilization, flourishing in lean soil.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, during the growing season with a diluted, balanced formula.
