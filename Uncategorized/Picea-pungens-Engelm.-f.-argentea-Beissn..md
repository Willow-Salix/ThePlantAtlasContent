## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Rocky Mountains of the United States (e.g., Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day) is essential for optimal growth and color, reflecting its open, high-altitude native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture, especially when young and during dry periods. Prefers well-drained soil and tolerates some drought once established, mimicking mountain rainfall and snowmelt patterns. |

## Introduction
A spruce is a tree of the genus Picea, a genus of some 37 species of coniferous evergreen trees in the family Pinaceae, found in the northern temperate and boreal (taiga) regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Picea is treated either in the subfamily Pinoideae, or the sole genus in its own subfamily Piceoideae.
Spruces can be distinguished from other genera of the family Pinaceae by their needles (leaves), which are four-sided and attached singly to small persistent peg-like structures (pulvini) on the twigs. The needles are shed when 4–10 years old, leaving the twigs rough with the retained pegs. Pests of spruce forestry include green spruce aphid, eastern spruce budworm, European spruce bark beetle, and great spruce bark beetle.
Spruce is a major producer of timber for construction, and of pulp for paper. It is the standard material for the soundboards of stringed instruments. Native Americans use the roots of some species for weaving baskets. The Norway spruce is widely used for Christmas trees. Artists including Augustin Hirschvogel in the 16th century, Edvard Munch around 1900, and Eija-Liisa Ahtila in the 21st century have depicted spruces in etchings, oil paintings, and video installations.

## Care Guide
This conifer thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring consistent moisture when young and during dry spells. Once established, it becomes more drought-tolerant, with minimal fertilization generally needed, mimicking its alpine coniferous forest origins.

### Fertilizer
Generally low. Established trees in good soil rarely need fertilization. For young trees or those in poor soil, a balanced evergreen fertilizer can be applied in early spring.
