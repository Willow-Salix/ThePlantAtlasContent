## Care Guide
This plant thrives in warm, sunny to partially shaded environments with well-drained soil, reflecting its native pine flatwoods and open field habitats. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and has low fertilizer needs due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor sandy soils. It is a relatively low-maintenance, drought-tolerant species once established.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. It is adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils, so excessive fertilization is not required. A light, balanced feed once or twice during the growing season is generally sufficient.
