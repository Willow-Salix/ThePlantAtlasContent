| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical America, specifically Brazil and the Caribbean |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Forest Margins and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect light to full sun for optimal flowering, but can tolerate partial shade. |

## Introduction
Solanum seaforthianum, the Brazilian nightshade, is a flowering evergreen vine of the family Solanaceae native to tropical South America.  As a member of the Solanum genus, it is related to such plants as the tomato and potato. It is characterized by clusters of four to seven leaves and can climb to a height of 6 m (20 ft) given enough room.  It blooms in the mid to late summer with clusters of star-shaped purple inflorescence followed by scarlet marble-sized berries.  The plant is highly heat resistant, but cannot tolerate frost conditions.  The plant contains modest amounts of various tropane alkaloids such as atropine, scopolamine and hyoscyamine and should be considered mildly toxic and inedible.
Promising molluscicidal and schistosomicidal activities were displayed for the S. seaforthianum extracts and fractions which are attributed to the glycoalkaloid content.
The species has become widely naturalised outside its native range and is an invasive species in Australia, Africa, Indochina, the Pacific Islands and India, choking native vegetation and poisoning livestock.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Brazilian Nightshade needs plenty of bright, indirect to full sun and consistently moist soil, reflecting its tropical origins. Fertilize regularly during warm months to support its vigorous growth and abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during its active growing season (spring and summer) due to its vigorous growth and flowering.
