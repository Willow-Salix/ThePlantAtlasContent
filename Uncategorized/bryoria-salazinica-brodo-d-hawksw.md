## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern temperate and boreal regions of North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, coastal Alaska, Canada) and Europe (e.g., Scandinavia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate to Boreal Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade, mimicking its growth on tree branches beneath a forest canopy or in frequently cloudy/foggy conditions. Avoid harsh, direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity, absorbing moisture from rain, fog, and dew. Regular misting or placement in a terrarium-like environment will be necessary to simulate its natural moist conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bryoria is a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. Many members of this genus are known as horsehair lichens. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in boreal and cool temperate areas. These lichens typically grow as slender, hair-like strands that hang from conifer trees or form small bushes, ranging in colour from dark brown to pale grey. They play important ecological roles, particularly as winter food for caribou in northern forests, where some species can accumulate in large quantities in the forest canopy. The genus contains about 35 species found worldwide, with ongoing discoveries of new species especially in mountainous regions of Asia and western North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Bryoria salazinica, provide high atmospheric humidity and bright, indirect light to partial shade, avoiding direct sun. No fertilization is needed, as it relies on clean air and atmospheric moisture for sustenance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required or beneficial. Lichens obtain nutrients from airborne particles and rainwater; clean air is more critical than soil-based nutrients.
