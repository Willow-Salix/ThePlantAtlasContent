## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Rocky Mountains and associated ranges in states like Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, and Canadian provinces Alberta, British Columbia. |
| **Climate** | Montane/Subalpine Grassland (cool to temperate with cold, snowy winters and moderate summers) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring bright conditions typical of open meadows or forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, ensuring consistent moisture during the growing season from spring through fall, but allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Reduce watering significantly in winter during dormancy. |

## Care Guide
Wolf's trisetum thrives in cool to temperate conditions with full sun to partial shade and well-draining, lean soil. Provide moderate, consistent moisture during its active growing season, reducing watering dramatically in winter to emulate its native snowy habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low, as it is adapted to lean, well-draining soils of mountain environments. A light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial if growth appears weak.
