## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Americas, including the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America (e.g., Brazil, Guyana, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Very low, indirect light; thrives in deep shade or dappled light conditions, avoiding any direct sun, which can easily scorch its delicate fronds. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist substrate and extremely high humidity, often necessitating a terrarium or Wardian case; never allow the growing medium to dry out completely. Regular misting is beneficial. |

## Introduction
Trichomanes is a genus of ferns in the family Hymenophyllaceae, termed bristle ferns. The circumscription of the genus is disputed. All ferns in the genus are filmy ferns, with leaf tissue typically 2 cells thick.  This thinness generally necessitates a permanently humid habitat, and makes the fronds somewhat translucent. Because of this membrane-like frond tissue, the plant is prone to drying out. "Filmy ferns" in the taxa Hymenophyllaceae grow in constantly wet environments. Many are found in cloud forests such as "Choco" in Colombia. There are also members of the taxa that can grow submersed in water. 
The name bristle fern refers to the small bristle that protrudes from the indusia of these ferns.

## Care Guide
The Crisped Bristle Fern thrives in a constantly moist, high-humidity environment with minimal, indirect light, replicating its native tropical rainforest understory. Consistent watering to prevent drying out, coupled with extremely high ambient humidity and very dilute fertilization, are crucial for its delicate nature.

### Fertilizer
Very light feeding, once or twice a year at most with a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/8 strength) during the growing season, or incorporate slow-release pellets into the substrate.
