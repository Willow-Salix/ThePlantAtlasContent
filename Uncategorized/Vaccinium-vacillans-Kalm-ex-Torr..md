## Introduction
Vaccinium  vack-SIN-ee-əm is a common and widespread genus of shrubs or dwarf shrubs in the heath family (Ericaceae). The fruits of many species are eaten by humans and some are of commercial importance, including the cranberry, blueberry, bilberry (whortleberry), lingonberry (cowberry), and huckleberry. Like many other heath plants, they are restricted to acidic soils.

## Care Guide
The Dryland Blueberry thrives in well-drained, acidic soil under full sun to partial shade conditions. It is notably drought-tolerant once mature, requiring infrequent watering that allows the soil to dry out between sessions. Avoid over-fertilization, opting for minimal application of an acid-specific formula only if necessary.

### Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; use an acidic fertilizer sparingly, if at all, specifically formulated for acid-loving plants.
