## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wenatchee Mountains Lupine thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean to poor soils, reflecting its dry montane origins. Water infrequently once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid any heavy fertilization, particularly with nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, especially nitrogen, as it is a nitrogen-fixing legume and thrives in poor to moderately fertile soil.
