## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically eastern Oregon and Washington, USA) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Semi-Arid Montane Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6-8+ hours of direct sunlight daily), mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent watering. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings; it is highly drought-tolerant and prone to root rot with excessive moisture. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
Blue Mountain Buckwheat requires full sun and excellent drainage, thriving in conditions that mimic its native semi-arid montane environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely, and avoid over-fertilization as it prefers lean soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. It thrives in lean, rocky soils and excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
