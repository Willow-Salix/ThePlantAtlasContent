## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forest Understory (often in damp, shaded areas near water or in marshy ground) |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade; direct sun exposure should be avoided as it can cause drying and damage. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist substrate, never allowing it to dry out completely. High ambient humidity is also crucial for its health and growth. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions, replicating its natural forest floor habitat. Ensure constant high humidity and keep the substrate uniformly damp without being waterlogged, while providing only low to partial light exposure. Fertilization is generally minimal to non-existent.

### Fertilizer
Very low; mosses are not heavy feeders. If desired, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied very infrequently, or none at all.
