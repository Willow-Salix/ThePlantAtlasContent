| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-arid Montane (e.g., Pinyon-Juniper woodlands, sagebrush steppe, montane grasslands) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (requires direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day due to open, exposed native habitats) |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, deep watering (adapted to drought conditions; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking natural rainfall and snowmelt patterns) |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, preferring to dry out between deep soaks. It is well-suited for lean, well-draining soils and generally does not require fertilization, mimicking its natural semi-arid montane environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none (thrives in lean, well-draining, rocky soils characteristic of its native habitat; excessive fertilizer can be detrimental)
