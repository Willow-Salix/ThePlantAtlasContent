## Care Guide
This sedge requires consistently wet soil and ample sunlight, reflecting its native wetland habitat. Provide a bog-like environment to ensure proper hydration. Fertilization should be light, as it is accustomed to moderate to low nutrient conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to often nutrient-poor wetland soils.
