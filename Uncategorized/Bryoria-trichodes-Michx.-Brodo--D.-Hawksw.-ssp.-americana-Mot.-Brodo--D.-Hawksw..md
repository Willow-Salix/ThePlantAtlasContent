## Introduction
Bryoria is a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. Many members of this genus are known as horsehair lichens. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in boreal and cool temperate areas. These lichens typically grow as slender, hair-like strands that hang from conifer trees or form small bushes, ranging in colour from dark brown to pale grey. They play important ecological roles, particularly as winter food for caribou in northern forests, where some species can accumulate in large quantities in the forest canopy. The genus contains about 35 species found worldwide, with ongoing discoveries of new species especially in mountainous regions of Asia and western North America.

## Care Guide
American Horsehair Lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with moderate to bright indirect light, typical of boreal and montane forests. It necessitates high atmospheric humidity and regular moisture from misting or natural precipitation, absorbing nutrients directly from the air and thus requiring no conventional fertilization.

### Fertilizer
No conventional fertilization required; obtains nutrients from the air and precipitation.
