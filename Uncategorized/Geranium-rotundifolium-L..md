## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa (especially the Mediterranean Basin) |
| **Climate** | Temperate and Mediterranean |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; tolerates full sun in cooler climates but appreciates some afternoon shade in hotter regions. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is somewhat drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to Mediterranean dry summers. |

## Introduction
Geranium is a genus of 422 species of annual, biennial, and perennial plants that are commonly known as geraniums or cranesbills. They are found throughout the temperate regions of the world and the mountains of the tropics, with the greatest diversity in the eastern part of the Mediterranean region.
The palmately cleft leaves are broadly circular in form. The flowers have five petals and are coloured white, pink, purple, or blue, often with distinctive veining. Geraniums will grow in any soil as long as it is not waterlogged. Propagation is by semiripe cuttings in summer, by seed, or by division in autumn or spring.
Geraniums are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, ghost moth, and mouse moth. At least several species of Geranium are gynodioecious. The species Geranium viscosissimum (sticky geranium) is considered to be protocarnivorous.

## Care Guide
This adaptable plant prefers full sun to partial shade and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings to mimic its native temperate and Mediterranean climates. It thrives in well-draining, average soil and has low to moderate fertilizer requirements, making it relatively low-maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It thrives in average soils and does not require heavy fertilization; a balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
