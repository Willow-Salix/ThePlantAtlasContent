## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Coastal Scrub |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; best flowering and dense growth occur with at least 6 hours of direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires moderate watering during its first year to establish, then very infrequent to no summer watering. Demands excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Ceanothus is a genus of about 50–60 species of nitrogen-fixing shrubs and small trees in the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae). Common names for members of this genus are buckbrush, California lilac, soap bush, or just ceanothus. "Ceanothus" comes from Ancient Greek: κεάνωθος (keánōthos), which was applied by Theophrastus (371–287 BC) to an Old World plant believed to be Cirsium arvense.
The genus is native to North America with the highest diversity on the western coast. Some species (e.g., C. americanus) are restricted to the eastern United States and southeast Canada, and others (e.g., C. caeruleus) extend as far south as Guatemala. Most are shrubs 0.5–3 metres (1.6–9.8 ft) tall, but C. arboreus and C. thyrsiflorus, both native to California, can be small multi-trunked trees up to 6–7 metres (20–23 ft) tall.

## Care Guide
This California native thrives in a Mediterranean climate with full sun to partial shade and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal summer water. Avoid fertilizing, especially with high-nitrogen products, as it fixes its own nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low nutrient requirements; generally no fertilizer is needed. Ceanothus species are nitrogen-fixers, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
