## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (specifically Maui and Molokai) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect to partial shade, replicating its habitat within the understory or at the edge of a forest canopy. Protect from direct, intense sunlight which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Water regularly, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly between waterings, mirroring the frequent rainfall of its native environment. |

## Introduction
Geniostoma is a genus of around 49 species of flowering plants in the family Loganiaceae. They are shrubs or small trees, with inflorescences borne in the axils of the simple, petiolate, oppositely-arranged leaves. The flowers are arranged in cymes, and each is pentamerous.
The name Geniostoma derives from the Greek words γένειον (geneion; "beard") and στόμα (stoma; "mouth"), referring to the hairs in the corolla tube of some species. The genus is widely distributed across the Pacific Ocean from Japan, Malesia to Australia in the west, and east to the Tuamotu Archipelago; one species is also found on the Mascarene Islands.
The Hawaiian endemic genus Labordia is included in Geniostoma by Plants of the World Online and other authors. The Hawaiian species are commonly known as labordias or as Kamakahala in Hawaiian. These two genera have been grouped together in the family "Geniostomaceae", but are considered by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to be part of a wider Loganiaceae.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions that mimic its native Hawaiian wet forest habitat, requiring consistent soil moisture and protection from direct sunlight through indirect or partial shade. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot and provide moderate fertilization during its active growth phases to support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer). Utilize a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks, or a slow-release granular fertilizer, to mimic the nutrient cycling of rich forest soils.
