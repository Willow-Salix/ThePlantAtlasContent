## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Montane Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours direct sunlight daily) to partial sun, as it naturally grows in open, exposed rocky slopes and grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established due to its adaptation to semi-arid conditions. |

## Introduction
Muhlenbergia montana, the mountain muhly, is a species of grass. It is native to North and Central America, where it is found throughout the Western United States, the Sierra Nevada, Mexico, and Guatemala.
It can be found in several types of habitat, including grassland, rocky outcrops, mountains, and open areas.

## Care Guide
Mountain Muhly is a resilient, low-maintenance grass that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its semi-arid montane origins. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry thoroughly, and it requires minimal fertilization, making it ideal for xeriscaping or dry garden areas.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal. Soils in its native habitat are often lean and rocky; therefore, heavy fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental. A light, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring, if at all, is sufficient.
