## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically high elevations in states like Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring significant direct light due to its natural high-altitude, open habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its short growing season, ensuring excellent drainage. Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings, as it does not tolerate consistently wet conditions. |

## Introduction
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in high light conditions and very well-drained, lean soil, mimicking its native rocky mountain habitats. Water moderately during its short growing season, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization to prevent nutrient burn.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Native alpine soils are typically lean, so a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly, if at all, during the growing period.
