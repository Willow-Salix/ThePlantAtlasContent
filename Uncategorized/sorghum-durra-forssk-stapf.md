| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Semi-arid / Savanna |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |

## 🌱 Overview
Sorghum bicolor, commonly called sorghum () and also known as broomcorn, great millet, Indian millet, Guinea corn, or jowar, is a species in the grass genus Sorghum cultivated chiefly for its grain.  The grain is used as food by humans, while the plant is used for animal feed and ethanol production. The stalk of sweet sorghum varieties, called sorgo or sorgho and taller than those grown for grain, can be used for forage or silage or crushed for juice that can be boiled down into edible syrup or fermented into ethanol.
Sorghum originated and was domesticated in Sudan, and is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is the world's fifth-most important cereal crop after rice, wheat, maize, and barley. It is typically an annual, but some cultivars are perennial. It grows in clumps that may reach over 4 metres (13 ft) high. The grain is small, 2 to 4 millimetres (0.08 to 0.2 in) in diameter.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Durra Sorghum is a hardy, drought-tolerant grain that demands full sun and moderate, infrequent watering. It is well-suited for hot, semi-arid conditions and does not require rich soil or heavy fertilization to thrive. Ensure soil dries out between waterings to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a balanced fertilizer application at planting or early growth, but thrives in average to poor soils without excessive fertilization.
