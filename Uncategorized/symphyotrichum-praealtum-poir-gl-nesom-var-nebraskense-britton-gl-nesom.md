## 🌱 Overview
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Nebraska aster flourishes in full sun, mimicking its native open prairie environment. It requires moderate, consistent watering in well-drained soil, with tolerance for short dry spells once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to naturally fertile grassland soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to rich prairie soils; an annual application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is generally sufficient.
