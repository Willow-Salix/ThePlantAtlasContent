## 🌱 Overview
Pentachaeta is a genus of the family Asteraceae; the entire genus is endemic to California.  Of the six species members, at least one, Pentachaeta bellidiflora, is classified as an endangered species.  The etymology of the genus name derives from Greek penta, meaning five, and chaeta, meaning bristle, referring to the pappus scales of P. aurea. It was combined in Chaetopappa, but later work led to the genus being recognized as definitely separate. It is most closely related to Rigiopappus and Tracyina. Pygmydaisy is a common name for Pentachaeta.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, typical of its arid scrubland origins. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between irrigations, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Fertilizer is rarely needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; thrive in lean, well-draining soils. A very light, balanced fertilizer might be applied once in early spring if grown in poor potting mix.
