## Introduction
Avena is a genus of Eurasian and African plants in the grass family. Collectively known as the oats, they include some species which have been cultivated for thousands of years as a food source for humans and livestock. They are widespread throughout Europe, Asia and northwest Africa. Several species have become naturalized in many parts of the world, and are regarded as invasive weeds where they compete with crop production. All oats have edible seeds, though they are small and hard to harvest in most species.

## Care Guide
To care for Small Oat, provide full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, particularly during summer dormancy, and offer a light fertilizer only once a year in spring.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; adapted to generally poorer soils found in its native habitat. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring should suffice.
