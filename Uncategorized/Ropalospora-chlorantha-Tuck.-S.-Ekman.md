## Introduction
Ropalospora is a genus of lichen-forming fungi, and the sole member of the monogeneric family Ropalosporaceae. The genus was circumscribed by Italian lichenologist Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo in 1860. The family was proposed by Josef Hafellner in 1984.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in consistently cool, moist, and humid environments, mimicking its native temperate rainforest habitat. Provide indirect light and ensure very high ambient humidity, as it absorbs moisture directly from the air. Traditional fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers; obtains necessary nutrients from the air and its substrate (e.g., tree bark).
