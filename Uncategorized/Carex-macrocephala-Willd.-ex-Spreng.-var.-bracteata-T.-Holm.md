## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in exposed, sandy coastal environments. Provide full sun and well-drained soil, keeping it moderately moist but allowing brief dry periods. Fertilization is generally not required, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils.
