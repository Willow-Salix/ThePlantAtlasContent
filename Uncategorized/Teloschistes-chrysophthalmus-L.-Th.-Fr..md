## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in Mediterranean, temperate, and subtropical coastal regions globally, including Southern Europe, California (USA), Baja California (Mexico), Coastal Chile, South Africa, and parts of Australia and New Zealand. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean and Coastal Temperate/Subtropical Shrubland and Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect to full sun exposure, mimicking its natural habitat on exposed trees, shrubs, or rocks in coastal environments. |
| **Watering** | Relies heavily on atmospheric moisture (fog, dew) and rainfall; requires high humidity with intermittent periods of drying between hydration cycles. |

## Introduction
Teloschistes is a genus of lichens in the family Teloschistaceae, of which it is the namesake. It was circumscribed by Norwegian botanist Johannes Musaeus Norman in 1852. The name of the genus means "split ends". The genus was originally described as Borrera by Swedish lichenologist Erik Archarius, after English botanist William Borrer, but this name was rejected.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic/saxicolous lichen thrives in bright, open conditions characteristic of coastal Mediterranean and temperate zones. Provide ample light and high atmospheric humidity, ensuring periods of drying between hydration cycles, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilization; obtains all necessary nutrients from airborne particles and dissolved minerals in precipitation.
