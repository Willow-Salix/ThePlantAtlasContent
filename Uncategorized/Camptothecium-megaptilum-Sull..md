## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountain regions of USA and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Very low to low, indirect light. Thrives in dappled shade conditions, typical of a dense forest floor. Avoid any direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture. Keep the substrate damp but never waterlogged. Requires high ambient humidity; daily misting is beneficial to prevent drying out. |

## Care Guide
This moss prefers a cool, highly humid, and consistently moist environment with very low, indirect light, mirroring its native forest floor habitat. Ensure constant dampness without waterlogging and high air humidity, while strictly avoiding direct sunlight and excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses have very low nutrient needs and can be harmed by excessive fertilization. They typically derive sufficient nutrients from their substrate.
