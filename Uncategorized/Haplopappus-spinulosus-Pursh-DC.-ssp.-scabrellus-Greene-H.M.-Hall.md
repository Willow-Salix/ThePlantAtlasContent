## Care Guide
Spiny Goldenweed thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, typical of its native arid grasslands. It requires infrequent, deep watering, tolerating drought conditions exceptionally well, and benefits from minimal to no fertilizer to mimic its natural, nutrient-poor environment.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to No Fertilizer (adapted to lean, often rocky or sandy soils; excessive fertilization can harm the plant).
