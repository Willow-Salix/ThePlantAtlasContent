## Care Guide
This forest floor plant thrives in cool, shaded conditions with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Protect it from direct sunlight and ensure adequate humidity. Fertilizer needs are minimal, mirroring its natural habitat with rich organic matter but low nutrient availability.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding, if any, with a balanced or acid-loving fertilizer, or a slow-release organic amendment. Heavy fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
