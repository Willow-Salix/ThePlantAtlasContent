## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caucasus region, stretching from the Black Sea coast of Turkey through Georgia to Azerbaijan, and parts of northern Iran |
| **Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests (humid, mild winters, warm summers) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade, avoiding intense direct afternoon sun. It thrives in conditions mimicking a forest understory. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is key; water regularly to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Tolerates some drought once established but prefers consistent humidity. |

## Introduction
Hedera, commonly called ivy (plural ivies), is a genus of 12–15 species of evergreen climbing or ground-creeping woody plants in the family Araliaceae, native to Western Europe, Central Europe, Southern Europe, Macaronesia, northwestern Africa and across central-southern Asia east to Japan and Taiwan. Several species are cultivated as climbing ornamentals, and the name ivy especially denotes common ivy (Hedera helix), known in North America as "English ivy", which is frequently planted to clothe brick walls.

## Care Guide
Colchis Ivy thrives in a cool, humid environment with consistent soil moisture and protection from harsh direct sunlight. Mimic its native forest understory habitat by providing partial to full shade and regular watering to keep the soil consistently moist. Fertilize sparingly during active growth to support its robust foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer. Less is needed in richer soils or for mature plants.
