## Care Guide
Brachythecium moss thrives in consistently moist, shaded conditions, mirroring its native temperate wetland environment. It requires high humidity and should be protected from intense direct sunlight to prevent drying. No specific fertilization is usually needed for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low; mosses typically do not require supplemental fertilization, as they absorb necessary nutrients from their immediate environment.
