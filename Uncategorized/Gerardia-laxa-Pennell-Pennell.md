## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, consistently moist to wet conditions, characteristic of its native coastal plain bogs and savannas. It prefers poor to moderately fertile, acidic soils and does not require heavy fertilization. Ensure adequate moisture and sunlight for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; native to nutrient-poor, acidic soils, so minimal or no fertilization is typically needed.
