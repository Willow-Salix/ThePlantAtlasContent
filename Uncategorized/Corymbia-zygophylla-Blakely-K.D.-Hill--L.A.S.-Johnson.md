## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Australia (Kimberley region of Western Australia and the Top End of the Northern Territory) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflective of its open savanna habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply and infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its native wet and dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Corymbia, commonly known as bloodwoods, is a genus of about one hundred species of tree that, along with Eucalyptus, Angophora and several smaller groups, are referred to as eucalypts. Until 1990, corymbias were included in the genus Eucalyptus and there is still considerable disagreement among botanists as to whether separating them is valid. As of January 2020, Corymbia is an accepted name at the Australian Plant Census.

## Care Guide
This Australian native thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil, reflecting its tropical savanna origins. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, preferring deep, infrequent watering. Fertilizer needs are minimal due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer sparingly only if growth appears to be struggling.
