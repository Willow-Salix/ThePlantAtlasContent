*Coptidium pallasii (Schltdl.) Tzvelev* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Subarctic regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Greenland), Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Russia), and Asia (e.g., Siberia) |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra, Subarctic Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | High exposure to bright light, including full sun, but preferably cool direct or indirect light, reflecting its high-latitude open tundra habitat where sun intensity is lower than temperate zones. |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to waterlogged soil; requires constant moisture and thrives in saturated conditions, mimicking its native bogs, mossy ground, and shallow waters. |

## Care Guide
Pallas' Buttercup, an arctic wetland species, demands consistently wet to waterlogged soil and high exposure to cool, bright light. It thrives in nutrient-poor conditions, requiring minimal to no fertilization to replicate its native tundra environment.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers nutrient-poor conditions typical of tundra and wetland environments. Minimal to no fertilization is generally required.
