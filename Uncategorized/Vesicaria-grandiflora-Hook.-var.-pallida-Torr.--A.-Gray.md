*Vesicaria grandiflora Hook. var. pallida Torr. & A. Gray* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma) |
| **Climate** | Arid Grassland and Chihuahuan Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day) |
| **Watering** | Low watering frequency. Highly drought-tolerant; allow soil to dry out completely between deep waterings. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soil, characteristic of its native arid grasslands and desert. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering where the soil dries completely between sessions. Fertilization should be minimal, if any, to avoid over-enrichment.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Thrives in lean soils; a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer once in spring if needed, but often not necessary.
