## Care Guide
Thriving in conditions mimicking its tropical island origin, the Balfour Aralia prefers bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide regular fertilization during its growing period to support lush foliage.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced liquid fertilizer applied monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer), reducing frequency in fall and winter.
