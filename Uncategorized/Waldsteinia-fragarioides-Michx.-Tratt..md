## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (Appalachian Mountains region, extending from Quebec to Georgia and west to Missouri) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade; it thrives in the understory where it receives dappled light or protection from intense afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil; it prefers regular moisture, mimicking the even rainfall of its native habitat. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly before re-watering, but avoid letting it dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Waldsteinia, the barren strawberries, is a genus of the rose family (Rosaceae).  It contains about six species native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere.  A number of species are cultivated as a ground cover in gardens, including Waldsteinia fragarioides from North America, Waldsteinia geoides from Europe, Waldsteinia lobata, and Waldsteinia ternata from Eurasia (from Central Europe to Siberia, China, and Japan).

## Care Guide
The Appalachian Barren Strawberry thrives in conditions mirroring its native temperate forest understory, preferring partial to full shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It requires low to moderate fertilization, ideally benefiting from organic matter. Ensure consistent hydration, especially during dry periods, to support its lush groundcover habit.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from rich, organic soil with decaying leaf litter. An annual application of organic compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient.
