## Care Guide
This Chilean native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its Mediterranean and temperate grassland origins. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, as it exhibits good drought tolerance once established. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. As a leguminous plant (Fabaceae family), it fixes nitrogen, so heavy fertilization is unnecessary. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is sufficient.
