## Care Guide
Thriving in its native tropical Puerto Rico, this zephyrlily requires abundant sunshine and consistently moist, well-draining soil during its growth phase. It benefits from reduced watering during dormancy, mimicking its natural wet and dry seasons. Moderate feeding supports its vigorous blooming.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season, or use a slow-release granular fertilizer once at the beginning of the growing season.
