## Care Guide
Odontoschisma thrives in cool, humid, and consistently moist environments with low light, mimicking its natural bog and forest understory habitat. Ensure high ambient humidity and never allow the substrate to dry out. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Liverworts have very low nutrient requirements and can be harmed by excessive or concentrated fertilization.
