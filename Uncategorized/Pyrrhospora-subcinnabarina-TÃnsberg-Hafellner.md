## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pacific Northwest of North America (e.g., coastal Oregon, Washington, British Columbia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate, indirect light. This epiphytic lichen thrives in the shaded understory or filtered light of dense forests. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is crucial. Requires consistent atmospheric moisture, possibly daily misting if ambient humidity is low. Avoid complete desiccation, but also prevent prolonged standing water on the organism. |

## Introduction
Pyrrhospora is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Lecanoraceae. The genus was established in 1855 by the German lichenologist Gustav Wilhelm Körber, who named it after the distinctive reddish-brown colour of the spores, combining Greek words meaning 'reddish-brown' and 'spore'. These lichens form thin crusty films on rocks and tree bark, producing button-shaped fruiting bodies that start reddish-brown and turn almost black with age. The genus contains eight species and is distinguished by its unique spore colouration and chemical compounds including anthraquinone pigments that give the characteristic reddish tinge.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in very high humidity and low to moderate, indirect light, mimicking its native temperate rainforest environment. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture and should never be allowed to dry out completely. No traditional fertilization is needed, as it absorbs nutrients from the air and its host surface.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens absorb trace nutrients directly from the air and their substrate (e.g., tree bark). Traditional soil-based fertilizers are unnecessary and potentially harmful.
