## Introduction
Schoenoplectus (club-rush [Old World species], bulrush or tule [New World species]) is a genus of plants in the sedge family with a cosmopolitan distribution. Note that the name bulrush is also applied to species in the unrelated genus Typha as well as to other sedges. The genus Schoenoplectus was formerly considered part of Scirpus, but recent phylogenetic data shows that they are not closely related.

## Care Guide
Streambank Bulrush thrives in full to partial sun with consistently wet or submerged roots, mimicking its natural temperate wetland habitat. It is not a heavy feeder, requiring only low to moderate fertilization, making it well-suited for water gardens, bogs, or pond margins.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder, but a balanced, slow-release aquatic plant fertilizer can be applied sparingly in the growing season if growth is weak.
