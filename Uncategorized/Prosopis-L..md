## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States, Mexico, Central and South America, parts of Africa and Southwest Asia |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland, Desert, Dry Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring intense direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant, requiring very infrequent watering once established. Water deeply but rarely, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Mesquite is a common name for some plants in the genera Neltuma and Strombocarpa, which contain over 50 species of spiny, deep-rooted leguminous shrubs and small trees. They are native to dry areas in the Americas. Until 2022, these genera were traditionally included in a broad view of the genus Prosopis, but that genus is now restricted to a few species native to the Old World.
Mesquites have extremely long taproots to seek water from very far under ground, making them extremely drought-tolerant. As they are legumes, mesquites are one of the few sources of fixed nitrogen in the desert habitat. Their fruits, known as "mesquite pods", are dry and often sweet, edible for humans and livestock, and served as a staple food for indigenous peoples in the deserts of North America.

## Care Guide
Mesquite thrives in full sun and requires very little water, making it ideal for arid landscapes. It is adapted to poor soils and needs minimal to no fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; adapted to poor, lean soils and capable of fixing nitrogen. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be beneficial in extremely poor soils, but is often unnecessary.
