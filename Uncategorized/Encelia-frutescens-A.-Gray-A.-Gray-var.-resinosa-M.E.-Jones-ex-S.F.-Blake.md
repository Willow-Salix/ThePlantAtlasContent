## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., California, Arizona, Nevada) and parts of Northern Mexico, specifically in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure, mimicking its open desert habitat where it receives intense, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant; prefers infrequent watering. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in cooler months, to simulate natural desert rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Encelia is a genus of the plant family Asteraceae whose members are frequently called brittlebushes. It consists of shrubs (and one geophyte) of arid environments in southwestern North America and western South America.
All have n = 18 chromosomes. All the North American species are obligate outcrossers. In cultivation, the species readily form fertile F1 hybrids, F2s, and backcrosses, but in natural areas of sympatry, F2s and backcrosses are absent or rare.
Encelia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the leaf miner Bucculatrix enceliae which feeds exclusively on Encelia farinosa.
The phylogenetic sister group of Encelia is a clade comprising the genera Enceliopsis and Geraea. The three genera are informally called the "Encelia alliance".
Encelia is named in honor of German biologist Christophorus Enzelius, 1517–1583.

## Care Guide
This desert native thrives on neglect, requiring full sun and very little water once established. It is crucial to provide excellent drainage and avoid overwatering. Fertilization is rarely needed, supporting its preference for lean, well-aerated soils.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needs. Native to lean desert soils, it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. If necessary, a very dilute, low-nitrogen fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring.
