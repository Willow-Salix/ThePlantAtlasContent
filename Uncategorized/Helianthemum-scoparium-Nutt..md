## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily California, extending to Arizona) and Baja California, Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), typical of its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant; prefers infrequent, deep watering during extended dry periods, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Helianthemum (), known as rock rose, sunrose, rushrose, or frostweed, is a genus of about 110 species of flowering plants in the family Cistaceae. They are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, especially in the Mediterranean.

## Care Guide
The Bisbee Peak Rushrose is a sun-loving, drought-tolerant plant originating from Mediterranean and arid scrubland climates. It demands full sun, excellent drainage, and infrequent watering once established, thriving on minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, perhaps once in spring with a balanced, slow-release formula.
