## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Southeastern United States (specifically prairie, open woodland, and glade regions) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Temperate Deciduous Forest (edges and clearings) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun is preferred, but it can tolerate light partial shade, especially in the hottest parts of its range. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the soil to dry out between waterings. It is quite drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its prairie origins. |

## Introduction
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## Care Guide
Carolina Larkspur thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native prairie and open woodland habitats. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and is fairly drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization needs are low, preferring average to poor soils over overly rich conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. It thrives in average to poor soils and does not require rich amendments or heavy feeding. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is usually sufficient.
