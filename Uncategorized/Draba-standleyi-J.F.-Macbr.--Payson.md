## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Andes Mountains (Peru, Bolivia) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires direct, intense light typical of high-altitude environments above the tree line. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. Mimics snowmelt periods followed by drier, well-drained conditions; very sensitive to waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Draba is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, commonly known as whitlow-grasses (though they are not related to the true grasses).

## Care Guide
This alpine plant requires full sun and excellent drainage, thriving in conditions similar to its high-altitude native habitat. Water moderately, ensuring the soil dries between waterings, and keep fertilizer to a minimum to avoid stressing the plant.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, with a highly diluted balanced formula.
