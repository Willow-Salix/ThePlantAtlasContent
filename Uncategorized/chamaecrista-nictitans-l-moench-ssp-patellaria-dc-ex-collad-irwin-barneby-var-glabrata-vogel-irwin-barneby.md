## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Sensitive Partridge Pea thrives in full to partial sun, mimicking its native tropical savanna environment. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between applications, and benefits from well-draining soil. Fertilize sparingly, as its nitrogen-fixing ability reduces the need for external nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.
