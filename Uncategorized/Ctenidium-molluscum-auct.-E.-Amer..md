## Care Guide
This moss requires high humidity and consistently moist, well-drained conditions, mimicking its native forest floor habitat. Provide low, indirect light and avoid direct sun to prevent desiccation. Minimal to no fertilization is needed.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer; if used, apply an extremely diluted liquid fertilizer (1/8 strength) very sparingly.
