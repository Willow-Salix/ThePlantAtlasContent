## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Europe (Scandinavia, Russia) |
| **Climate** | Boreal Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Regular, moderate watering; allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings, mimicking consistent moisture without waterlogging found in meadows. |

## Introduction
Taraxacum () is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, which consists of species commonly known as dandelions. The scientific and hobby study of the genus is known as taraxacology. The genus has a near-cosmopolitan distribution, absent only from tropical and polar areas. Two of the most common species worldwide, T. officinale (the common dandelion) and T. erythrospermum (the red-seeded dandelion), are European species introduced into North America, where they are non-native. Dandelions thrive in temperate regions and can be found in yards, gardens, sides of roads, among crops, and in many other habitats.
Like other members of the family Asteraceae, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is called a floret. In part due to their abundance, along with being a generalist species, dandelions are one of the most vital early spring nectar sources for a wide host of pollinators. Many Taraxacum species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.

## Care Guide
This Dandelion variant thrives in full sun with consistent, moderate watering, replicating its native boreal meadow habitat. It is a resilient plant requiring minimal fertilization, adapting well to average soil conditions. Ensure good drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typically thrives in average soil conditions. Occasional balanced fertilizer can be beneficial in nutrient-poor soils, but it's not a heavy feeder.
