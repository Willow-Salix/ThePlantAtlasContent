## Care Guide
Houndstongue Hawkweed thrives in full to partial sun, typical of its native European montane habitats. It prefers consistent moisture but well-drained soil and does not require heavy fertilization. Mimicking these conditions will ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer. Rich soils are not strictly necessary; a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the growing season would suffice.
