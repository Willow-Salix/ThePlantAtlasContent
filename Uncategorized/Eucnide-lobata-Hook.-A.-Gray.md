## Care Guide
This desert native requires abundant sunlight and is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent, deep watering during its active growth. Keep fertilizer to a minimum, as it thrives in lean soil conditions typical of its arid habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; a light, balanced feed once or twice during the active growing season, or no fertilizer in well-amended soil.
