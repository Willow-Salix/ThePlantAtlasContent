## Care Guide
The Falcate Rush thrives in consistently wet, bog-like conditions and requires full to partial sun. It is well-suited to nutrient-poor or moderately rich soils, so heavy fertilization should be avoided. Replicating its native montane wetland environment is key to its successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to naturally nutrient-poor bog and wet meadow soils; excessive fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
