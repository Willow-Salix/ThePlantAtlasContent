## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Boulder Sedge is a resilient plant best suited for temperate montane/subalpine climates, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is a low-maintenance sedge that does not demand heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is generally sufficient, as native soils are often nutrient-poor.
