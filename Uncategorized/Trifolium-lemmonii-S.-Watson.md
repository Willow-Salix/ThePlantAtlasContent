| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, thriving in open slopes and meadows. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to high watering during the growing season; prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially with regular access to water from snowmelt or precipitation. |

## Introduction
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## Care Guide
Lemmon's clover thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate montane meadows, preferring full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil during its active growth. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires minimal to no supplemental fertilizer, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil and does not require additional nitrogen.
