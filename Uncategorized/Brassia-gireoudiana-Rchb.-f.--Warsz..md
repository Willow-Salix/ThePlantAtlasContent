## Care Guide
To mimic its native humid montane cloud forest, provide bright, indirect light and maintain high humidity. Water frequently to keep the medium consistently moist, allowing slight drying between waterings. Fertilize regularly with a weak orchid solution during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Apply a balanced orchid fertilizer at half strength every 2-3 waterings during periods of active growth. Reduce frequency during dormancy.
