## Introduction
Veronica is the largest genus in the flowering plant family Plantaginaceae, with about 500 species. It was formerly classified in the family Scrophulariaceae. Common names include speedwell, bird's eye, and gypsyweed.
Taxonomy for this genus was changed in the early 21st century, with the genus Hebe and the related Australasian genera Derwentia, Detzneria, Chionohebe, Heliohebe, Leonohebe and Parahebe now included. Monophyly of the genus is supported by nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and cpDNA.
The taxa of the genus are herbaceous annuals or perennials, and also subshrubs, shrubs or small trees when Hebe is included. Most of the species are from the temperate Northern Hemisphere, though with some species from the Southern Hemisphere; Veronica sect. Hebe is mostly from New Zealand.

## Care Guide
This alpine native thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring bright, cool conditions, and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil during its active growth. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to lean, montane soils and excess nutrients can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding or no fertilizer needed; adapted to lean, well-draining soils.
