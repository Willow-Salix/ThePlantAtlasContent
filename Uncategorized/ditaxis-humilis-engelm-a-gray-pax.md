## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dwarf Ditaxis is a robust desert plant that thrives in full sun conditions. It requires very little water, being highly drought-tolerant, so allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to arid, nutrient-scarce environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; this plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and generally does not require regular fertilization. A very light, balanced feed can be applied once in spring if growth seems weak.
