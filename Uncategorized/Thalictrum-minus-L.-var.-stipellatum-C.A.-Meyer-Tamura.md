## Introduction
Thalictrum ( ) is a genus of 120-200 species of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae, native mostly to temperate regions. Meadow-rue is a common name for plants in this genus.
Thalictrum is a taxonomically difficult genus with poorly understood species boundaries; it is in need of further taxonomic and field research for clarification.
Despite their common name of "meadow-rue", Thalictrum species are not closely related to the true rue (family Rutaceae), but resemble its members in having compound leaves twice or thrice divided.

## Care Guide
This temperate plant prefers conditions similar to its native forest edges and meadows, thriving in partial to full sun with adequate moisture. Ensure well-drained soil and provide light fertilization during its growing period. Protect from intense afternoon sun in warmer climates to prevent stress.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring and early summer during the active growing season.
