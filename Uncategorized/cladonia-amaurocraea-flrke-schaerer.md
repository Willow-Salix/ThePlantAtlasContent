# Cup Lichen
### *Cladonia amaurocraea (FlÃ¶rke) Schaerer*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern Hemisphere, circumboreal and circumpolar regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia, Greenland) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Boreal Forest (Taiga) and Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. In its native cool climate, it tolerates open, exposed sites. Avoid intense, direct sun, especially in warmer temperatures, to prevent desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High ambient humidity and occasional misting are preferred, mimicking natural rainfall and dew. Allow to dry out slightly between hydration events; avoid standing water or constantly soggy conditions as lichens absorb water from the air and surface moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations.
Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).
Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.
Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dunes, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.
Larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes continuella, feed on Cladonia species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mimic its native cool, humid, and well-aerated environment with bright indirect light to partial shade. Provide moisture through high humidity or occasional misting, ensuring good air circulation and avoiding traditional fertilizers, which are harmful to lichens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens are highly sensitive to fertilizers and obtain necessary nutrients from air, dust, and rainfall. Introducing artificial fertilizers can be detrimental.
