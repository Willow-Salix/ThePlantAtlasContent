## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia (Borneo, Sulawesi, Maluku) and Oceania (New Guinea, Solomon Islands) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light (deep shade), as it is a saprophyte lacking chlorophyll and thrives on the forest floor. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist substrate, high humidity, but well-drained to prevent waterlogging, mimicking tropical rainforest conditions. |

## Introduction
Gymnosiphon (yellowseed) is a genus of monocotyledonous flowering plants from the yam order. Like most of the other members of the family in which the plant is placed (Burmanniaceae), Gymnosiphon is entirely myco-heterotrophic genus that does not contain chlorophyll and respectively does not perform photosynthesis.
Gymnosiphon is distributed across the moist, tropical regions of Asia, America and Africa. The plant has very small size and thin stems. Leaves are rudimentary and with appearance like scales or bracts. Its flowers are white in color, pale and solitary or sometimes collected in tiny inflorescences of few depending on the species. They are also actinomorphic with three larger outer tepals and three more inner and smaller ones.
Phylogenetically Gymnosiphon is placed in the clade of Burmanniaceae sensu stricto.

## Care Guide
This saprophytic plant thrives in conditions typical of a tropical rainforest floor, requiring deep shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Its unique nutrient acquisition from decaying organic matter and associated fungi means standard fertilization is ineffective; focus instead on an appropriate, humus-rich substrate.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable in the traditional sense; requires a substrate rich in decaying organic matter and specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.
