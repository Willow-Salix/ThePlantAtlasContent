## Introduction
Parietaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae, native to temperate and tropical regions across the world.
They are annual or perennial herbaceous plants growing to 20–80 cm tall, with green or pink stems. The leaves are alternate, simple, entire, often with a cluster of small leaves in their axils. Individual flowers are bisexual or unisexual, produced in clusters of three to many together in the leaf axils. Plants have either bisexual flowers or both staminate ("male") and carpellate ("female") flowers. The fruit is a small dry achene.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in humid, partially shaded environments, mimicking its native woodland understory. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil and provide light fertilization during the growing season for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength, once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer).
