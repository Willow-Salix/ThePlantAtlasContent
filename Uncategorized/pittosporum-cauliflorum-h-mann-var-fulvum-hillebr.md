## 🌱 Overview

Plants in the genus Pittosporum are shrubs or trees with leaves arranged alternately along the stems.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian native thrives in conditions reminiscent of its tropical wet forest home. Provide bright indirect light or partial shade, ensure consistently moist yet well-draining soil, and offer regular, diluted fertilization during its growing period. High humidity is also greatly beneficial for its well-being.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer) to support robust growth in typically nutrient-rich, organic soils.
