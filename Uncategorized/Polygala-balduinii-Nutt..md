## Introduction
Polygala is a large genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygalaceae. They are commonly known as milkworts or snakeroots. The genus is distributed widely throughout much of the world in temperate zones and the tropics. The genus name Polygala comes from the ancient Greek "much milk", as the plant was thought to increase milk yields in cattle.

## Care Guide
Baldwin's Milkwort thrives in consistently moist to wet, acidic to neutral soils under full to partial sun, mimicking its native boggy pine flatwood and savanna habitats. Ensure high humidity and never let the soil dry out completely for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization, particularly in nutrient-poor sandy or boggy soils. May benefit from an acid-balanced formula.
