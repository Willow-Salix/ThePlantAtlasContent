## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Europe, extending eastward to the Russian Far East and China across temperate Eurasia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (edges, disturbed areas, scrubland) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full sun, preferring locations with good light exposure found at forest margins and hedges. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist soil, reflecting the moderate rainfall in its native temperate habitats; avoid waterlogging but do not let the soil dry out completely for extended periods. |

## Introduction
Fallopia is a genus of about 12 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat family, in the past often included in a wider treatment of the related genus Polygonum, and previously including Reynoutria. The genus is native to temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, but species have been introduced elsewhere. The genus includes species forming vines and shrubs.

## Care Guide
Bushy Knotweed thrives in temperate climates, requiring partial shade to full sun exposure and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It benefits from average soil fertility, reflecting its natural habitat at woodland edges and disturbed areas, making it relatively low-maintenance if its basic needs are met.

### Fertilizer
Average fertility; benefits from moderately rich soil with organic matter, similar to disturbed woodland edges. An annual application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can support robust growth.
