| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Woodland and Grassland Edges, often with monsoonal influences. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial sun to partial shade, mimicking its understory or edge habitat; can tolerate full sun in cooler regions but may suffer in hot, direct afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, reflecting its native environment's regular rainfall. Water regularly, especially during dry spells, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Potentilla indica, known commonly as mock strawberry, Indian strawberry, or snakeberry in North America,  is a flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It has ternate foliage and an aggregate accessory fruit, similar to true strawberries of the genus Fragaria. Unlike the white or slightly pink flowers of true strawberries, Potentilla indica has yellow flowers, as do many other Potentilla species. It is native to eastern and southern Asia, but has naturalized in many regions worldwide. They are considered to be an invasive species and weed by some.
Many sources consider this plant part of the genus Potentilla due to evidence from chloroplast genetic sequence data that the genus Duchesnea is included within Potentilla, though some still list it as Duchesnea indica.

## Care Guide
Indian Strawberry is a resilient groundcover that flourishes in partial sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its care is relatively low-maintenance, needing regular watering and minimal fertilization to support its adaptable nature.

### Fertilizer
Generally has low fertilizer needs, thriving in average to poor soils. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring can be beneficial for vigorous growth, but is often not strictly necessary.
