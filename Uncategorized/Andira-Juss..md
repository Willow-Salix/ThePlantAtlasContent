## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Americas, including Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America (especially Brazil) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Forests (including Tropical Rainforests and Seasonal Dry Forests) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Young plants or understory species may prefer dappled light, while mature canopy trees require ample direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture, especially during the active growing season, mimicking its native high rainfall periods. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Andira is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is distributed in the tropical Americas, except for A. inermis, which also occurs in Africa. It was formerly assigned to the tribe Dalbergieae, but molecular phylogenetic studies in 2012 and 2013 placed it in a unique clade within subfamily Faboideae named the Andira clade.
Compared to other Faboideae the genus has unusual systems of root nodules and fruits, which are drupes. In most species the fruits are dispersed by bats, and in some they are dispersed by rodents. They may also be dispersed on water.
Plants of the genus are used in traditional medicine in Brazil to treat fever and as purgatives and vermifuges. The treatments are toxic in high doses, however. Chemical compounds isolated from the genus include isoflavones, flavanols, glycosides, pterocarpans, chromone, and ursolic acid.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Andira requires bright light, consistent moisture, and well-draining soil, reflecting its native tropical habitat. Regular fertilization during its growth phase will support its robust development.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular fertilization with a balanced, slow-release tropical plant fertilizer during the growing season, particularly in nutrient-poor soils.
