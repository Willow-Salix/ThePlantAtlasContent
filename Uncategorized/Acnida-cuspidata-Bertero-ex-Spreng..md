## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and warm, humid conditions, typical of its native tropical and subtropical environments. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and is tolerant of various soil types without heavy fertilization. Overall, it is a robust and low-maintenance annual plant, often growing in disturbed areas.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced feed occasionally in very poor soils may be beneficial.
