## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mountainous and Arctic regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe (e.g., Alps, Pyrenees), Asia (e.g., Siberia, Himalayas), and North America (e.g., Alaska, Rocky Mountains). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Subalpine, and Arctic regions, characterized by cold temperatures, strong winds, and often rocky, well-draining soils. |
| **Sunlight** | High; prefers full sun exposure to thrive, mimicking its open, exposed native habitats. Can tolerate partial sun but flowering and vigor may be reduced. |
| **Watering** | Low; requires well-draining soil and tolerates drought. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot, which is critical for this succulent. |

## Introduction
Sedum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, members of which are commonly known as stonecrops. The genus has been described as containing up to 600 species, subsequently reduced to 400–500. They are leaf succulents found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, but extending into the southern hemisphere in Africa and South America. The plants vary from annual and creeping herbs to shrubs. The plants have water-storing leaves. The flowers usually have five petals, seldom four or six. There are typically twice as many stamens as petals. Various species formerly classified as Sedum are now in the segregate genera Hylotelephium and Rhodiola.
Well-known European species of Sedum are Sedum acre, Sedum album, Sedum dasyphyllum, and Sedum hispanicum.

## Care Guide
Rhodiola thrives in bright, sunny conditions with excellent drainage, mimicking its native alpine and arctic environments. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering and fertilization. Ensure ample light and avoid overwatering to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low; naturally adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Fertilize minimally, if at all, using a very dilute solution once a year in spring.
