## 🧤 Care Instructions
Adapted to the sunny, dry conditions of Macaronesia, this grass thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. It requires moderate to low watering, tolerating drought once established, and should be allowed to dry out between waterings. Fertilize sparingly to promote healthy growth without encouraging excessive lushness.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate fertilizer. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in spring or a light liquid feed every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season is sufficient. Over-fertilizing should be avoided.
