## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (primarily California, Oregon, and British Columbia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Dry-summer temperate woodland / Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Avoid harsh midday sun, especially in warmer climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Water moderately during its active growing season (late winter through spring), allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Reduce watering significantly, or cease, during its summer dormancy period. |

## 🌱 Overview
Piperia is a former genus within the orchid family Orchidaceae that has since been subsumed under Platanthera.
These plants are known as rein orchids. They are native to western North America, especially California and the Pacific Northwest. This former genus has the following characteristics: (a) a bisexual perennial nongreen plant that grows from buried tubers; fruit capsule bearing numerous minute seeds; (c) pollen that is sticky, and which is removed as sessile anther sacs; and (d) stigma fused with its style into a column. There were a total of ten species in the genus Piperia, which is named for American botanist Charles V. Piper. The genus members manifest generally cylindrical spikes or racemes.
The subsurface architecture of these terrestrial wild orchids consists of a rhizome structure, from which emanate tubers.  The rhizome extracts nutrients from fungal intermediates and may also store some of these nutrients.  A basal rosette of leaves develops from the tuber at the surface of the soil, each of the two or three leaves being lanceolate in shape. Each leaf ranges from 10 to 15 centimeters in length and 20 to 35 millimeters in width.  Leaves of younger plants are often more diminutive in size.
Below are the ten former species of Piperia and their currently accepted names:

Piperia candida - Platanthera ephemerantha
Piperia colemanii - Platanthera colemanii
Piperia cooperi - Platanthera cooperi
Piperia elegans - Platanthera elegans
Piperia elongata - Platanthera elongata
Piperia leptopetala - Platanthera leptopetala
Piperia michaelii - Platanthera michaelii
Piperia transversa - Platanthera transversa
Piperia unalascensis - Platanthera unalascensis
Piperia yadonii - Platanthera yadonii

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This orchid thrives with bright indirect light and moderate watering during its active growth period in spring. It requires a pronounced dry dormancy throughout the summer, mirroring its native Mediterranean-like climate. Light fertilization supports its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Apply a dilute, balanced orchid-specific fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during its active growing season. Do not fertilize during dormancy.
