## Introduction
Paronychia is an inflammation of the skin around the nail, often due to bacteria or fungi.  
Its sudden (acute) occurrence is usually due to the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Gradual (chronic) occurrences are typically caused by fungi, commonly Candida albicans. 
Risk factors for paronychia include frequent hand washing and trauma to the cuticle, such as from chronic nail biting or hangnails.
Treatment typically involves antibiotics for bacterial infections and antifungals for fungal infections. If there is pus formation, incision and drainage may be necessary.
Paronychia is commonly mistakenly used interchangeably with herpetic whitlow or felon, which are distinct conditions.

## Care Guide
Lundell's Nailwort is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its arid native environment. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to completely dry between sessions, and benefits from minimal to no fertilization. This plant is well-suited for xeriscaping or rock gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in lean soils. Fertilization is generally not required, or only a very diluted, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring if growth appears stunted.
