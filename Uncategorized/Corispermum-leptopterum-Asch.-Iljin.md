## Introduction
Corispermum is a genus of plants in the family Amaranthaceae. Common names given to members of the genus involve bugseed, tickseed, and tumbleweed.

Bugseeds are native to North America and Eurasia, but little is known about their taxonomy and distribution.

## Care Guide
Adapted to harsh arid conditions, Corispermum leptopterum requires full sun exposure and minimal watering. Ensure extremely well-draining soil and avoid rich nutrients, as it prefers lean growing conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant thrives in poor, sandy, nutrient-deficient soils.
