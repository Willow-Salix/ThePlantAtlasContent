## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, primarily California, extending into parts of Nevada, Utah, and Arizona |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland / Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sun daily) given its native habitat in open, exposed areas. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its native dry conditions. |

## Introduction
Oenothera is a genus of about 145 species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas. It is the type genus of the family Onagraceae.  Common names include evening primrose, suncups, and sundrops. They are not closely related to the true primroses (genus Primula).

## Care Guide
This Evening Primrose is a resilient, drought-tolerant plant best suited for full sun exposure and well-draining soil. It requires minimal watering once established and generally thrives without the need for additional fertilizer, adapting well to leaner conditions. Mimic its native arid scrubland environment for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low; it thrives in poor to average, well-draining soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary, and excessive nutrients may lead to leggy growth rather than more blooms.
