## Care Guide
The Mojave Menodora is a desert plant requiring full sun and very little water, reflecting its arid native habitat. It thrives in well-draining, poor soils and has minimal fertilizer requirements. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; thrives in lean, poor soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, typically once a year with a very dilute, balanced fertilizer if growth seems stunted.
