## 🧤 Care Instructions
Blackbutt thrives in full sun with consistently moist soil, particularly during establishment, reflecting its native humid subtropical environment. Given its adaptation to nutrient-poor Australian soils, minimal fertilization is required. Once established, it exhibits some drought tolerance but benefits from regular watering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Adapted to nutrient-poor Australian soils; requires minimal to no fertilization. Excessive nutrients can be harmful. If needed, use a low-phosphorus native plant fertilizer sparingly.
