## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
The Fullerton Willow thrives in full sun with consistently moist to wet soil, reflecting its riparian native habitat in Southern California. Ensure ample water supply, especially during warmer months, and provide a balanced fertilizer to support vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied in spring to encourage growth, particularly in nutrient-deficient soils.
