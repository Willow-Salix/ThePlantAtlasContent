## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Grassland / Vernal Pool |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sun per day) to mimic its open meadow and grassland habitat. |
| **Watering** | High watering needs during its active growing season (spring), requiring consistent moisture to replicate the seasonally wet conditions of vernal pools. Allow to dry out considerably or stop watering during summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## Care Guide
This clover thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean grasslands and vernal pools, requiring full sun and consistent moisture during its spring growing season. Allow for a dry period in summer as it typically goes dormant. Its nitrogen-fixing capabilities mean it has low to moderate fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so high nitrogen fertilizers should be avoided. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer at a reduced strength or a slow-release option is suitable if soil nutrients are poor.
