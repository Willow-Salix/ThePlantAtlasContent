## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Pantropical regions, including parts of South America (e.g., Brazil), Asia (e.g., India, Thailand), and Oceania (e.g., New Caledonia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect to partial shade, consistent with an epiphyte growing on tree bark under a dense forest canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires very high humidity and frequent moisture from mist or rain; does not absorb water through roots but directly from the environment. Sensitive to prolonged dry conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Anthracothecium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Pyrenulaceae. It comprises five species of crustose, bark-dwelling, pyrenocarpous lichens in the tropics and subtropics, and that in the current sense the genus is diagnosed by young ascospores that are euseptate (true septa) and remain mostly euseptate when mature, contrasting with Pyrenula, where distosepta and thickened endospore is the norm. The ascomata (fruiting bodies) are carbonised (blackened and charcoal-like), usually simple or aggregated in predictable ways, and ostioles may be apical or lateral depending on species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical lichen thrives in consistently high humidity and indirect light, mimicking its native rainforest canopy environment. It absorbs all necessary moisture and nutrients directly from the air and occasional rainfall, therefore traditional watering and fertilizing are not applicable. Focus on maintaining a humid atmosphere and a suitable substrate like bark.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Lichens derive essential nutrients from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust) and minerals leached from their host substrate (e.g., tree bark).
