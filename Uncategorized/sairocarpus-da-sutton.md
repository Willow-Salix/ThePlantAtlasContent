## 🌱 Overview
Antirrhinum is a genus of plants in the Plantaginaceae family, commonly known as dragon flowers or snapdragons because of the flowers' fancied resemblance to the face of a dragon that opens and closes its mouth when laterally squeezed. They are also sometimes called toadflax or dog flower. They are native to rocky areas of Europe, the United States, Canada, and North Africa. Antirrhinum species are widely used as ornamental plants in borders and as cut flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
These plants prefer a sunny location with well-draining soil, mimicking their native Mediterranean climate. Water moderately during their active growth period, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and be mindful of reduced needs during summer heat. Fertilize sparingly to encourage robust, compact growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season is sufficient, or none if soil is naturally fertile.
