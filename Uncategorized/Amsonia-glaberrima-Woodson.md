## Care Guide
Fringed Bluestar is a hardy plant best suited for full sun to partial shade in temperate to humid subtropical regions. It needs moderate watering during its establishment phase, becoming very drought-tolerant as it matures. This plant requires minimal fertilization, thriving in average, well-drained soils.

### Fertilizer
Has low fertilizer requirements. In average to lean soils, an annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is sufficient. Avoid excessive fertilization as it can lead to leggy growth.
