| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Georgia, Florida) |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Heartleaf Brickellia thrives in conditions mimicking its native humid subtropical environment. Provide full sun to partial shade and maintain consistent soil moisture, particularly during its active growth period. Fertilize sparingly, as it is not highly demanding of rich soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization needs. It is adapted to average to somewhat nutrient-poor soils common in open woodlands and pinelands, benefiting from light, balanced feeding during the growing season.
