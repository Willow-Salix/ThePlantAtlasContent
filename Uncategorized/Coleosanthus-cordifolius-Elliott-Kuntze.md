## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Georgia, Florida) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Woodland/Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade, adapting well to open woodland edges and pineland environments. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate, consistent moisture, thriving in the ample rainfall of its native climate. Tolerates brief dry spells once established but benefits from regular watering during extended dry periods. |

## Care Guide
Heartleaf Brickellia thrives in conditions mimicking its native humid subtropical environment. Provide full sun to partial shade and maintain consistent soil moisture, particularly during its active growth period. Fertilize sparingly, as it is not highly demanding of rich soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization needs. It is adapted to average to somewhat nutrient-poor soils common in open woodlands and pinelands, benefiting from light, balanced feeding during the growing season.
