## Introduction
Phemeranthus (fameflower) is a genus of flowering plants in the miner's lettuce family, Montiaceae, native to the Americas. It was formerly placed in Portulacaceae. The name is derived from the Greek words εφήμερος (ephemeros), meaning "living for one day," and ἄνθος (anthos), meaning "flower." Common names for the various species are often fame flower, rock rose, rock pink, and sand pink.

## Care Guide
The Tepic Flameflower thrives in bright, full sun conditions and well-draining soil, mimicking its arid native habitat. Allow the soil to dry completely between waterings to prevent root rot, as it is highly drought tolerant. Fertilizer needs are minimal.

### Fertilizer
Low. Fertilize sparingly, once or twice during the active growing season with a diluted, balanced fertilizer.
