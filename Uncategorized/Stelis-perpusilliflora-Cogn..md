## Introduction
Stelis, or leach orchids, are a large genus of orchids, with 1339 accepted species. The generic name Stelis is the Greek word for 'mistletoe', referring to the epiphytic habit of these species. These mainly epiphytic (rarely lithophytic) plants are widely distributed throughout much of South America, Central America, Mexico, the West Indies and Florida.
Stelis is abbreviated Ste. in the horticultural trade.
Many of the older species were named by Lindley, Ruiz & Pavon and Reichenbach, while many of the recent species were named by Carlyle A. Luer. An orchid of the genus Stelis was probably the first American orchid ever to be brought to Europe. An herbarium specimen was depicted in 1591 in Tabernaemontanus' herbal book.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical moist forests: high humidity, consistent moisture without waterlogging, and bright, indirect light. Provide good air circulation and fertilize sparingly with a dilute solution during its growing periods for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize regularly during active growth with a very dilute, balanced orchid fertilizer (e.g., one-quarter to one-eighth strength) every 1-2 weeks.
