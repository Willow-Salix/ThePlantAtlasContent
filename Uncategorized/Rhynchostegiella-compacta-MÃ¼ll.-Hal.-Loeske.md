## Care Guide
This moss thrives in environments mimicking its native temperate forest floor, requiring low light, high humidity, and consistently moist conditions. Avoid direct sun and over-fertilization to ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses obtain sufficient nutrients from their environment; over-fertilization can be harmful. Use dilute, specialized moss fertilizer sparingly if growth seems poor.
