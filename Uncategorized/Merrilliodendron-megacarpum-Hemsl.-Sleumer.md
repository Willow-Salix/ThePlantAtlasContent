## Introduction
Merrilliodendron is a monotypic genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Icacinaceae. It has a synonym of Peekeliodendron Sleumer. The only species is Merrilliodendron megacarpum (Hemsl.) Sleumer
Its native range is Central Malesia to western Pacific. It is found in the Bismarck Archipelago, the Caroline Islands, Marianas, New Guinea, Philippines, the Santa Cruz Islands, the Solomon Islands and Sulawesi.
The genus name of Merrilliodendron is in honour of Elmer Drew Merrill (1876–1956),  an American botanist and taxonomist, and also 'dendron' meaning tree. The Latin specific epithet of megacarpum is derived from the Greek word megacarpus meaning 'with big fruit'. The genus was first described and published in Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) Vol.48 on page 920 in 1934, and then the species was first described and published in Notizbl. Bot. Gart. Berlin-Dahlem Vol.15 on page 243 in 1940.

## Care Guide
Merrilliodendron megacarpum flourishes in conditions that replicate its tropical rainforest origins. Provide bright, indirect light and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained. Regular, moderate fertilization during active growth will support its development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, given the rapid nutrient cycling in its native rainforest soils.
