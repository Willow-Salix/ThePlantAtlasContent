## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America (e.g., Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela) and Caribbean Islands (e.g., Martinique, Guadeloupe) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Rainforest / Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; partial to deep shade, mimicking its epiphytic or epipetric position under a dense canopy. Avoid direct harsh sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Keep the growing medium consistently moist but not soggy, allowing for good drainage which is crucial for epiphytes. High ambient humidity is essential, requiring frequent misting or a humid environment. |

## Introduction
Elaphoglossum is a genus of ferns in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Elaphoglossoideae, in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I).

## Care Guide
This epiphytic fern thrives in conditions replicating its native tropical cloud forest habitat, demanding consistently moist, well-draining substrate and very high humidity. Provide low to medium indirect light and fertilize sparingly to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient, typically once a month during the active growing season (spring/summer) using a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength). Epiphytic ferns derive most nutrients from decaying organic matter and are not heavy feeders.
