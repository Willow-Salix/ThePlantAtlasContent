## Care Guide
Rand's goldenrod, native to the temperate Great Lakes region's moist sandy soils and fens, thrives in full to partial sun. It requires consistently moist soil, especially during the growing season, but also good drainage. This adaptable plant prefers average to poor soils and generally needs minimal or no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Prefers average to poor soils; fertilize sparingly, if at all, as over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth.
