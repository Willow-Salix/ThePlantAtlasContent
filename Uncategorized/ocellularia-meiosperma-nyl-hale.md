## 🧤 Care Instructions
This corticolous lichen requires high humidity and indirect light, mimicking its native tropical forest habitat. Regular moisture absorption from the air is essential, but traditional fertilization is unnecessary and potentially detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Lichens derive nutrients from the air and rain; added fertilizer can be harmful.
