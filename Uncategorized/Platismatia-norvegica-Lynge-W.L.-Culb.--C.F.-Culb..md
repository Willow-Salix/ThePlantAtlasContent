## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, Finland), Pacific Northwest of North America, Alaska, and parts of Siberia. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate and Boreal Forest biomes, often found in old-growth or subalpine forests characterized by high humidity and frequent precipitation. |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to partial shade. It thrives under a forest canopy, protected from direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity is critical. Requires frequent misting to keep moist, as it absorbs water directly from the air. Avoid prolonged periods of dryness, but also ensure good air circulation. |

## Introduction
Platismatia is genus of medium to large foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. The genus is widespread and contains 11 species. They resemble many other genera of foliose lichens in the Parmeliaceae, particularly Parmotrema, Cetrelia, and Asahinea.  Most species are found in forests  on the trunks and branches of conifer trees, although some species grow on rocks.
Species of Platismatia can be used to produce an orange-brown, yellow-brown, or brown dye, and at least one species was traditionally used to dye wool in Europe.

## Care Guide
The Norwegian Ragged Lichen demands a cool, very humid environment with indirect light, mimicking its native forest understory. Consistent moisture via frequent misting is essential for its survival, as it absorbs water directly from the air and its substrate. Traditional fertilization is unnecessary, as it gathers nutrients from its surroundings.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from the air, rain, and the substrate they grow on.
