## Care Guide
This California native thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-draining soil, reflecting its Mediterranean climate origins. Water moderately during active growth, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and reduce significantly in summer once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to leaner soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Prefers lean to average, well-draining soils. Over-fertilizing is generally not recommended and can lead to leggy growth.
