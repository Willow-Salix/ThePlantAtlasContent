## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This sedge demands perpetually wet to saturated soil conditions, ideally with full sun to partial shade. Mimic its native bog or wetland environment by ensuring constant moisture, even standing water, and provide minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. In its native, often nutrient-poor wetland habitats, it doesn't require heavy feeding; a very dilute, balanced fertilizer applied once in spring can suffice.
