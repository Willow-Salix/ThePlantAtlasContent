## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, North America, Asia) and parts of the Southern Hemisphere. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade, tolerating some morning sun but requiring consistent moisture to prevent desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged; high ambient humidity is crucial. Absorbs water directly from its surface and can withstand periods of dryness by going dormant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in consistently moist, humid, and shaded to partially shaded temperate environments. It requires frequent watering to maintain surface moisture but good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Avoid strong direct sunlight and high fertilizer use, as it prefers low-nutrient conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses derive sufficient nutrients from rainwater and their immediate substrate; high fertilizer concentrations can be harmful or encourage competing plants.
