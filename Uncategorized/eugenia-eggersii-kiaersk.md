## 🌱 Overview
Eugenia is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family Myrtaceae. It has a worldwide, although highly uneven, distribution in tropical and subtropical regions. The bulk of the approximately 1,100 species occur in the New World tropics, especially in the eastern Brazil's northern Andes, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Forest (coastal forests). Other centers of diversity include New Caledonia and Madagascar. Many species in the Old World have received a new classification into the genus Syzygium.
All species are woody evergreen trees and shrubs. Several are grown as ornamental plants for their attractive glossy foliage, and a few produce edible fruit that are eaten fresh or used in jams and jellies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Guasabara thrives in warm, humid conditions with consistent moisture, mimicking its tropical forest origin. Provide bright indirect light and maintain moist, well-draining soil, feeding regularly during its growth period to encourage healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Fertilize with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season.
