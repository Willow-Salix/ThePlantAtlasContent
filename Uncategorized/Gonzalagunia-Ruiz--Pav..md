| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforests, Cloud Forests, and Wet Montane Forests. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade, mimicking the understory or forest edge where they receive filtered light. Protect from intense, direct midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil is crucial, reflecting the frequent rainfall of its native habitat. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, but never let it dry out completely. Good drainage is essential to prevent root rot. |

## Care Guide
To care for Gonzalagunia, provide bright indirect light and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, never allowing it to dry out fully. High humidity is also beneficial, mimicking its native tropical rainforest environment. Fertilize regularly during the growing season to support robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Regular feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer) is beneficial, as native rainforest soils can be nutrient-rich due to rapid decomposition and cycling. Reduce or cease feeding during dormancy.
