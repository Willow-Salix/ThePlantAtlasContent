## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Canada, Alaska, Northern Europe (e.g., Sweden, Finland), and Russia. |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest (Taiga) and Subarctic zones, characterized by long, cold winters and cool, moist summers. |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. Thrives in shaded or partially shaded conditions, typical of the understory in dense coniferous forests. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is crucial. Requires consistent moisture absorption from the air or frequent misting; avoid prolonged dryness. Ensure good air circulation to prevent stagnant moisture. |

## Introduction
Rinodina is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 265 species. It is hypothesized that a few saxicolous species common to dry regions of western North America, southern Europe, North Africa and central Asia may date back 240 million years to the Middle Triassic.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures with low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native boreal forest habitat. It requires consistent moisture from the air, often achieved through misting, and does not need any supplemental fertilization.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and their substrate, and are highly sensitive to chemical inputs.
