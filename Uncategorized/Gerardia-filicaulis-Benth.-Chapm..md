## Care Guide
This annual plant thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil, characteristic of its native wet pinelands and savannas. It is adapted to less fertile conditions, requiring minimal supplemental fertilization. Ensure adequate moisture during its growing season for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal; this plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils, so heavy fertilization is not necessary and can be detrimental.
