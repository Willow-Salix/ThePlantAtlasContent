## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Basin (Southern Europe, North Africa, Western Asia), including Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Iran, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it typically grows in open fields and disturbed sites. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established, mimicking the dry summers of its native climate, but benefits from consistent moisture during its active growth phase in cooler, wetter seasons. |

## 🌱 Overview
Centaurea () is a genus of over 700 species of herbaceous thistle-like flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Members of the genus are found only north of the equator, mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere; the Middle East and surrounding regions are particularly species-rich.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Blessed Thistle thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, adapting well to its native Mediterranean climate. It requires moderate watering, preferring drier conditions once established, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Avoid overwatering to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It often thrives in poor or disturbed soils, so excessive fertilization is not required. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial if soil is particularly poor.
