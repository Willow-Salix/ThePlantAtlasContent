## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, primarily California and Oregon in the United States. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean climate, characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade. In hotter climates or during intense summer heat, some afternoon shade is beneficial to prevent stress. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular, moderate watering during its active growing season (late winter through spring). Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly between waterings. Reduce watering significantly or cease during its summer dormancy period. |

## Introduction
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## Care Guide
Zigzag Larkspur thrives in a Mediterranean climate, preferring full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. Provide consistent moisture during its spring growing season, reducing watering as it enters summer dormancy. A light spring fertilization supports healthy growth and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring as new growth emerges. Avoid over-fertilization, which can lead to lush foliage but fewer flowers.
