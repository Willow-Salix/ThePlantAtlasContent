## 🧤 Care Instructions
This annual thrives in full sun and demands abundant moisture during its winter-to-spring growth cycle, emulating its native vernal pool environment. It then requires a completely dry period through the summer months for dormancy. Minimal fertilization is recommended.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; this plant is adapted to the nutrient-poor, seasonal soils of vernal pools. Excessive fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
