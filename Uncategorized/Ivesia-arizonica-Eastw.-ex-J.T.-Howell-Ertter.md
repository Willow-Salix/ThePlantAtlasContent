## Care Guide
Rock Whitefeather thrives in conditions mimicking its native subalpine to alpine habitat. Provide full sun and ensure excellent soil drainage, watering moderately during the growing season while allowing the soil to dry between applications. Fertilization is rarely necessary due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor rocky soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. Native soils are often rocky and nutrient-poor; rich soil or heavy feeding can be detrimental.
