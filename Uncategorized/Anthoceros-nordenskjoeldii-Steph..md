## Care Guide
This hornwort thrives in cool, constantly moist environments with moderate to bright indirect light and high humidity. Ensure consistent moisture without waterlogging and provide minimal to no fertilizer to prevent adverse effects.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as bryophytes are sensitive to high nutrient concentrations common in their often nutrient-poor native habitats.
