## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
This resilient goldenrod thrives in sunny, well-drained locations mimicking its native coastal and montane scrublands. It requires minimal watering once established and prefers lean soils, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry gardens.
