## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and very well-draining, poor soils, mimicking its native dry temperate and Mediterranean habitats. Water sparingly, only when the soil is completely dry, and avoid excessive fertilization to prevent root rot and promote healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in poor, sandy or stony soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
