## Introduction
Acer leucoderme, the chalk maple, whitebark maple, or pale-bark maple) is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States from North Carolina south to northwest Florida and west to eastern Texas. It lives in the understory in moist, rocky soils on river banks, ravines, woods, and cliffs. Although generally an uncommon tree, it is most often found in the inner coastal plain and Piedmont regions of Georgia.

## Care Guide
The Chalk Maple is a adaptable tree native to the humid subtropical woodlands of the southeastern U.S. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate, consistent moisture, becoming drought-tolerant once established. Minimal fertilization is typically needed for this low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Generally low; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil fertility is poor or growth is desired.
