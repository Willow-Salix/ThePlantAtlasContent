| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caribbean islands (e.g., Jamaica, Cuba, Puerto Rico), Central America, and northern South America |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; avoid direct sunlight which can scorch fronds. |
| **Watering** | Keep substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged. High humidity is crucial, requiring frequent misting or placement near a humidifier. |

## Introduction
Asplenium is a genus of about 700 species of ferns, often treated as the only genus in the family Aspleniaceae, though other authors consider Hymenasplenium separate, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, a different chromosome count, and structural differences in the rhizomes. The type species for the genus is Asplenium marinum.
The most common vernacular name is spleenworts, applied to the more "typical" species. A. nidus and several similar species are called bird's-nest ferns, the Camptosorus group is known as walking ferns, and distinct names are applied to some other particularly well-known species.

## Care Guide
To mimic its native tropical rainforest environment, provide low to medium indirect light and ensure the substrate remains consistently moist. High humidity is paramount for this fern's health, so consider regular misting or a humid environment. Fertilize lightly during active growth periods.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a diluted liquid fern fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.
