## Care Guide
This Bigleaf Lupine variety thrives in temperate montane environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. Ensure consistent moisture in well-drained soil, avoiding waterlogging. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires little to no additional fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is needed, particularly nitrogen, as lupines are legumes that fix their own nitrogen.
