## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical islands of the Pacific, particularly Polynesia (e.g., French Polynesia, Cook Islands, Fiji). |
| **Climate** | Tropical Oceanic Climate / Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect light to partial sun. Protection from intense midday sun is crucial, especially in hotter climates, mimicking its natural habitat often near forest edges or in dappled light. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture; keep soil evenly moist but never waterlogged. High humidity is essential, reflecting its native tropical island environment with frequent rainfall. |

## Introduction
Gardenia is a genus of flowering plants in the coffee family, Rubiaceae, native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, Madagascar, Pacific Islands, and Australia.
The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus and John Ellis after Alexander Garden (1730–1791), a Scottish naturalist. The type species is Gardenia jasminoides, as first published by Ellis in 1761.

## Care Guide
The Tahitian Gardenia thrives in warm, humid conditions typical of its native Pacific island home. Provide bright, indirect light, consistent moisture, and regular feeding with an acid-loving fertilizer during active growth. Ensure high humidity to prevent leaf issues and support its fragrant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding during the growing season with a balanced, acid-loving fertilizer. Native soils in its range can vary, but consistent nutrient supply supports robust growth in a high-rainfall climate.
