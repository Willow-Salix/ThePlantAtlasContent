## Care Guide
Thyrea pyrenoides is a rock-dwelling lichen thriving in arid desert climates with high sun exposure. It requires extremely infrequent moisture, surviving long dry spells, and obtains most nutrients from its environment, making fertilizer unnecessary. Focus on mimicking its dry, sunny, and rocky native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Lichens derive nutrients primarily from the atmosphere and trace minerals from their rocky substrate; supplemental feeding is generally detrimental or unnecessary.
