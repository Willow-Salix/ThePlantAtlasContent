## Care Guide
This desert-adapted shrub thrives in full sun and arid conditions, requiring infrequent, deep watering once established. Avoid over-fertilizing as it is accustomed to nutrient-poor desert soils, mimicking its native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Very low; it is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils, so minimal to no fertilization is needed.
