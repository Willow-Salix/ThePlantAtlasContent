## 🌱 Overview
Ochrolechia is the sole genus in the fungal family Ochrolechiaceae. It comprises about 40 species of crustose lichens. These lichens typically form uneven, often thick, crust-like growths on various surfaces and are characterised by their white to pale grey thalli, which may have a greenish tint. The genus has a long evolutionary history, with fossils dating back to the Paleogene period, about 34 million years ago. Ochrolechia species have disc-like apothecia (fruiting bodies), which are usually yellowish or brownish-pink and often covered with a fine white powdery coating. The genus is widely distributed and includes both common and rare species, with some found in extreme environments such as arctic and alpine regions. Ochrolechia lichens produce diverse secondary metabolites, including orcinol depsides, depsidones, and xanthones.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in humid, shaded forest environments, requiring consistent moisture from ambient humidity and indirect light. Traditional fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful, as it obtains nutrients from the air and substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None; lichens obtain nutrients from the atmosphere and substrate, traditional fertilizers are harmful and unnecessary
