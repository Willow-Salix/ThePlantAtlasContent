## Care Guide
Caucasian Sweetvetch is a hardy perennial best suited to full sun and lean, well-drained soil, mimicking its native mountain habitat. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate to low watering and minimal to no fertilization. This plant is ideal for rock gardens or naturalized areas where it can thrive with little intervention.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; it thrives in lean, well-drained soils, often fixing its own nitrogen as a legume.
