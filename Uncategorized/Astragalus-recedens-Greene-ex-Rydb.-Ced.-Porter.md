## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun with minimal water and fertilizer, reflecting its native semi-arid, open habitats. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot and allow it to dry out between waterings. It is well-suited for xeriscaping or rock gardens in appropriate climates.

### Fertilizer
Low, thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils; excessive fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental.
