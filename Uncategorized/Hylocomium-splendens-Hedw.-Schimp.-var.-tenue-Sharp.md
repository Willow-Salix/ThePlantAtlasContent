## Introduction
Hylocomium splendens, commonly known as glittering woodmoss, splendid feather moss, stairstep moss, and mountain fern moss, is a perennial clonal moss with a widespread distribution in Northern Hemisphere boreal forests. It is commonly found in Europe, Russia, Alaska and Canada, where it is often the most abundant moss species. It also grows in the Arctic tundra and further south at higher elevations in, for example, northern California, western Sichuan, East Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the West Indies. In Scotland  it is a characteristic species of the Caledonian Forest. Under the UK's national vegetation classification system, pinewood community W18 is named as "Pinus sylvestris-Hylocomium splendens woodland",  indicating its significance in this ecosystem.

## Care Guide
Stair-step Moss thrives in cool, humid environments with deep shade to low indirect light, mimicking its native forest floor habitat. Ensure the substrate remains consistently moist and provide high humidity through misting, avoiding any direct sun exposure or strong fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very minimal to no fertilizer. Mosses thrive on low nutrient availability; strong fertilizers can be harmful.
