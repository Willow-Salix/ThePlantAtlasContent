## Introduction
Scutellaria is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. They are known commonly as skullcaps. The generic name is derived from the Latin scutella, meaning "a small dish, tray or platter", or "little dish", referring to the shape of the calyx. The common name alludes to the resemblance of the same structure to "miniature medieval helmets". The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution, with species occurring nearly worldwide, mainly in temperate regions.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Scutellaria tessellata requires conditions similar to its native Andean cloud forest, including consistently moist, well-draining soil and high humidity. Provide bright indirect light or partial shade, avoiding intense direct sun. Fertilize sparingly during its active growth period for best results.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength during the active growing season (spring and summer).
