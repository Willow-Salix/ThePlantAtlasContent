## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America, spanning from southeastern Canada south to northern Florida and west to the Great Plains. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests, often found in open woodlands, old fields, rocky outcrops, and disturbed areas. It is highly adaptable to a wide range of moisture and soil conditions. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for optimal growth, reflecting its natural habitat in open, unshaded environments. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Young plants may need regular watering during their first year to establish roots. |

## Introduction
Juniperus virginiana, also known as eastern redcedar, red cedar, Virginian juniper, eastern juniper, red juniper, and other local names, is a species of juniper native to eastern North America from southeastern Canada to the Gulf of Mexico and east of the Great Plains. Farther west it is replaced by the related Juniperus scopulorum (Rocky Mountain juniper) and to the southwest by Juniperus ashei (Ashe juniper).  It is not to be confused with Thuja occidentalis (eastern white cedar).

## Care Guide
This resilient conifer thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, exhibiting excellent drought tolerance once established. It requires minimal fertilization and is a low-maintenance choice, adapting well to various temperate conditions. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overwatering to prevent potential disease issues.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically does not require heavy fertilization as it naturally thrives in poor to average soils. If growth is exceptionally slow or foliage appears pale, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial.
