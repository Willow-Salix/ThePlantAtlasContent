## Introduction
Eupatorium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, containing from 36 to 60 species depending on the classification system. Most are herbaceous perennials growing to 0.5–3 m (1.6–9.8 ft) tall. A few are shrubs. The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The type species of the genus Eupatorium cannabinum, which is also the sole European species, is known as hemp-agrimony. Most in North America are commonly called boneset, thoroughwort or snakeroot. The genus is named after Mithridates VI Eupator, king of Pontus.

## Care Guide
To care for Eupatorium droserolepis B.L. Rob., provide partial sun to bright indirect light and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, avoiding waterlogging. Regular watering during the growing season, coupled with moderate fertilization, will support its health. These conditions emulate its native subtropical montane forest habitat.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer), reducing in fall and winter.
