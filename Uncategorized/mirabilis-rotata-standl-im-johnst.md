## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its arid homeland. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and benefits from minimal to no fertilization. Mimicking its natural environment with ample light and low moisture is key to its success.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils and typically does not require regular fertilization. If desired, a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring.
