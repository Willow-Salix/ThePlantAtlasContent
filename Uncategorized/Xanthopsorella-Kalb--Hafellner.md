## Care Guide
This tropical American lichen thrives in high humidity and indirect to dappled light, typical of its native rainforest habitat. Ensure frequent moisture through misting or a consistently damp substrate, and avoid direct sun and high nutrient fertilizers due to its sensitivity.

### Fertilizer
None required; lichens absorb nutrients directly from the air and rain. They are highly sensitive to commercial fertilizers and excess nutrients.
