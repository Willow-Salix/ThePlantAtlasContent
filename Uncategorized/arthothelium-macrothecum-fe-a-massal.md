## 🧤 Care Instructions
Arthothelium lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest environment, requiring high humidity and indirect, filtered light. Avoid direct sun and conventional fertilization, as it absorbs nutrients from the atmosphere and relies on constant atmospheric moisture for hydration.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
