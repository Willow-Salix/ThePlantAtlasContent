## Introduction
Abutilon  is a large genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia. General common names include Indian mallow and velvetleaf; ornamental varieties may be known as room maple, parlor maple, or flowering maple.
The genus name is an 18th-century Neo-Latin word that came from the Arabic ’abū-ṭīlūn (أبو طيلون),  the name given by Avicenna to this or a similar genus.
The type species is Abutilon theophrasti. Several species formerly placed in Abutilon, including the cultivated species and hybrids commonly known as "flowering maples", have recently (2012, 2014) been transferred to the new genus Callianthe.

## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun, the Dwarf Indian Mallow is well-adapted to arid conditions. Provide deep, infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between sessions. Its fertilizer needs are low, reflecting its native lean soil environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced fertilizer during the growing season is sufficient.
