## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Pacific Northwest (Western North America), specifically subalpine and alpine meadows in Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers bright, open conditions typical of high-elevation meadows, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil, especially during the growing season, but requires good drainage to prevent root rot. Mimic regular rainfall and snowmelt conditions of its native habitat, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rainiera is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the daisy family, Asteraceae.  The single species, Rainiera stricta (Greene) Greene, is endemic to the northwestern United States (Oregon and Washington). The genus is part of the tribe Senecioneae, and appears to be most closely related to Luina, another genus of northwestern North America, in which it was once placed.  Rainiera stricta is of conservation concern, with a G2G3 ranking from NatureServe, and is considered to be globally imperiled. It is known by the common name false silverback.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Sticky Rainiera, provide bright light from full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. This high-elevation plant thrives in cooler conditions and does not require heavy fertilization, preferring lean to moderately rich substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Thrives in lean to moderately rich, well-drained soils; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring might be beneficial if soil is poor, but generally does not require heavy feeding.
