## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Africa (South Africa, Eswatini, Zimbabwe) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Grassland/Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers at least 6 hours of direct sun daily to promote abundant flowering. |
| **Watering** | Water regularly and deeply during the active growing season (spring/summer), allowing the topsoil to dry out between waterings. Reduce watering significantly and allow the plant to go dormant in fall/winter, mimicking its native wet and dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Lapeirousia is a genus in the plant family Iridaceae. It is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, about a third of the species occurring in fynbos.

## Care Guide
Provide plenty of sunlight, mimicking its open grassland habitat. Water consistently during its growing season, then allow for a dry, dormant period to replicate its native climate cycles. Fertilize sparingly while actively growing to support its moderate nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Feed lightly with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growth period; no fertilizer during dormancy.
