## Introduction
Linum (flax) is a genus of approximately 200 species in the flowering plant family Linaceae. They are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the world. The genus includes the common flax (L. usitatissimum), the bast fibre of which is used to produce linen and the seeds to produce linseed oil.

The flowers of most species are blue or yellow, rarely red, white, or pink, and some are heterostylous. There is an average of 6 to 10 seeds per boll.
Linum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the cabbage moth, the nutmeg, the setaceous Hebrew character and Coleophora striolatella, which feeds exclusively on Linum narbonense.

## Care Guide
Harper's Flax is a low-maintenance plant that prefers warm, sunny conditions and well-drained, sandy soils. Mimic its native southeastern U.S. pine flatwoods by providing full to partial sun and allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It has low nutrient requirements, making fertilization largely unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils characteristic of its native environment. If desired, a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once during the growing season.
