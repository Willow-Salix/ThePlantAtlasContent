## Introduction
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## Care Guide
This prairie native thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, tolerating a range of soil types from average to poor. Water moderately, ensuring the soil isn't waterlogged, and it will become drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization is generally not needed, as it prefers leaner conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of compost can be beneficial in very poor soils.
