## Care Guide
This moss thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical moist forest environment: high humidity, consistently moist substrate, and low to indirect light. Avoid direct sun and over-fertilization to ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. If desired, use a highly diluted, specialized bryophyte fertilizer sparingly, as excess nutrients can be harmful.
