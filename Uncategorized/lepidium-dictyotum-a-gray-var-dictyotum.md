## 🌱 Overview
Lepidium is a genus of plants in the mustard/cabbage family, Brassicaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. It includes familiar species such as garden cress, maca, and dittander. General common names include peppercress, peppergrass, pepperweed, and pepperwort.  Some species form tumbleweeds.
The genus name Lepidium is from Greek meaning 'small scale', which is thought to be derived from a folk medicine usage of the plant to treat leprosy, which cause small scales on the skin. Another meaning is related to the small scale-like fruit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and prefers dry, alkaline conditions, making it highly drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. Minimal fertilization is required due to its adaptation to low-nutrient, high-mineral soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. This plant is adapted to naturally alkaline and often mineral-rich soils, so excessive fertilizer is generally unnecessary and potentially detrimental.
