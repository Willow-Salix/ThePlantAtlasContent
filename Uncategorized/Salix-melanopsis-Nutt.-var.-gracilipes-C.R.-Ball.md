## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (including Alaska, British Columbia, and the Rocky Mountain states of the United States) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Riparian Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for optimal growth, but can tolerate some shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to moist soil; highly intolerant of drought. Thrives in environments with abundant water, such as along streams, rivers, or in boggy areas. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This willow demands consistently wet soil and flourishes in full sun, reflecting its native riparian habitat. Ensure a continuous water supply and provide regular fertilization during its growth phase to support its vigorous development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Benefits from regular fertilization, especially during the active growing season, due to its fast growth rate and the often nutrient-rich alluvial soils of its native habitat.
