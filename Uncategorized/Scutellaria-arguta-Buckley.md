## Introduction
Scutellaria is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. They are known commonly as skullcaps. The generic name is derived from the Latin scutella, meaning "a small dish, tray or platter", or "little dish", referring to the shape of the calyx. The common name alludes to the resemblance of the same structure to "miniature medieval helmets". The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution, with species occurring nearly worldwide, mainly in temperate regions.

## Care Guide
The Blue Ridge Skullcap thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate woodlands, preferring partial shade to full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It benefits from moderate fertility, which can be achieved through an annual application of compost, ensuring robust growth without excessive feeding.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility; an annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer is usually sufficient.
