| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeast Asia, specifically New Guinea and surrounding islands. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low, indirect light; deep shade or dappled light conditions typical of a dense forest floor. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist substrate with excellent drainage; high ambient humidity is crucial. Water frequently, ensuring the substrate never dries out completely, but avoids waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Didymoplexis, commonly known as crystal orchids or as 双唇兰属 (shuang chun lan shu), is a genus of terrestrial leafless orchids in the family Orchidaceae, about twenty species of which have been described. Orchids in this genus have swollen, fleshy rhizomes and thin, pale, upright fleshy flowering stems with resupinate, bell-shaped white or pale yellowish brown flowers. They are native to Africa, Madagascar, Southeast Asia, Australia and various islands of the Pacific.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Didymoplexis fimbriata thrives in very low, indirect light and requires a consistently moist, well-draining substrate with high humidity, mimicking its native tropical rainforest floor. Fertilization should be minimal, focusing on providing decomposing organic matter rather than conventional fertilizers due to its saprophytic nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a saprophytic orchid, it obtains nutrients from decaying organic matter, often through fungal associations. Conventional fertilization should be extremely minimal or avoided, potentially incorporating decomposing leaf litter or a highly diluted specialized orchid fertilizer.
