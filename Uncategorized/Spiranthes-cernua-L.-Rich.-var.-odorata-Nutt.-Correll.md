## Introduction
Spiranthes is a genus of orchids in the subfamily Orchidoideae. They are known commonly as ladies tresses, ladies'-tresses, or lady's tresses. The genus is distributed in the Americas, Eurasia, and Australia. The genus name Spiranthes is derived from the Greek speira ("coil") and anthos ("flower"), and was inspired by the spirally arranged inflorescence.

## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid thrives in consistently wet to boggy, acidic soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires ample water, mimicking its native wetland habitats, and benefits from light, infrequent fertilization to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; prefers nutrient-poor to moderately rich, acidic soils. Use a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly during the growing season.
