## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
California Horkelia thrives in well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade, reflecting its native Mediterranean climate. Provide moderate water during its active growing period and allow the soil to dry out between waterings, especially during summer dormancy. It requires minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; native to lean to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization is generally not necessary and can be detrimental.
