## Care Guide
Elecampane prefers a temperate climate with full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It requires regular watering to prevent the soil from drying out, especially during its active growth period. Moderate fertility is adequate, often benefiting from an annual compost application.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility; an annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient for robust growth, particularly in average to poor soils.
