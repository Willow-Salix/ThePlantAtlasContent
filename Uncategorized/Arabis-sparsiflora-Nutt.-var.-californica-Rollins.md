## Care Guide
California Rockcress flourishes in environments similar to its native Mediterranean scrubland. Provide full sun, excellent drainage, and water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, as it is very drought-tolerant. It prefers lean soils, requiring little to no supplemental fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Minimal, if any; thrives in lean, rocky soils and does not require rich fertilization.
