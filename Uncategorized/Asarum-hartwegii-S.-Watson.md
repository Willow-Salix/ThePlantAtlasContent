## Care Guide
Hartweg's wildginger requires a shaded location with consistently moist, well-drained, and organically rich soil to thrive, much like its native forest understory habitat. Avoid direct sun and ensure regular watering without waterlogging. Fertilization needs are minimal, focusing on soil enrichment with organic matter.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in rich, organic soil. A light application of balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer or compost in early spring is beneficial.
