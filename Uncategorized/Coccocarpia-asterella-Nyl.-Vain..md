## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in tropical and subtropical regions globally, including Central and South America, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Low to very low light; thrives in shaded understory or areas with highly filtered light. Avoid all direct sunlight, which can cause desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity (70-90%+) and frequent atmospheric moisture from rain, mist, or fog. Water is absorbed directly from the environment onto its surface, not through roots. |

## Introduction
Coccocarpia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Coccocarpiaceae. Recent genetic studies suggest the genus originated in the Australasia–Oceania region during the Late Cretaceous period, roughly 76–100 million years ago, and later spread to Asia and the Americas. Some South American lineages are thought to have reached the continent via warm rainforest corridors that crossed Antarctica during the Palaeogene period, around 50–60 million years ago.
The genus is far more diverse than previously recognised, with ongoing research indicating it may contain over 200 species, and possibly more than 300, as many familiar names actually represent multiple distinct evolutionary lineages that are morphologically similar. These lichens typically grow as leaf-like structures in humid tropical forests around the world, with most species displaying a dull blue-grey upper surface and reddish-brown to nearly black disc-shaped fruiting bodies. Unlike many lichens that partner with green algae, Coccocarpia species associate with cyanobacteria of the genus Rhizonema.

## Care Guide
Coccocarpia asterella, a tropical foliose lichen, thrives in high humidity and very low light, typically found in the shaded understory of moist forests. Its care involves providing consistent atmospheric moisture through frequent misting and ensuring clean air, as it absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. Direct sunlight should be strictly avoided to prevent desiccation.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilization. Obtains necessary trace nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rain) and elements leached from its substrate (bark, leaves, or rock).
