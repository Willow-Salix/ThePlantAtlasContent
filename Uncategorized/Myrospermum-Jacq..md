| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest, Seasonally Dry Tropical Regions, Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in high light exposure, typical of open woodlands or forest edges in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Myrospermum is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It includes two species of trees and shrubs native to the tropical Americas, ranging from northeastern Mexico through Central America to Colombia and Venezuela. Typical habitats include seasonally-dry tropical to subtropcial woodland and bushland, often on rocky hillsides and along rivers and streams.

## Care Guide
Myrospermum prefers full sun to partial shade and moderate watering during its growing season, tolerating drier conditions when dormant. Provide well-draining soil and a balanced fertilizer during active growth. Its care mimics the wet and dry cycles of its native tropical dry forest environment.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer during the active growing season. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it can fix nitrogen, reducing the need for excessive nitrogen fertilization.
