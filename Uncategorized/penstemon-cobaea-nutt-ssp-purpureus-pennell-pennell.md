## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Southern United States (specifically Texas, Oklahoma, and surrounding Great Plains states) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) to replicate its open prairie environment. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to periods of dry weather common in its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun, mirroring its native prairie habitat where it receives abundant light. It prefers well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to lean or average soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; prefers lean to average soil. Over-fertilization can hinder flowering and overall health, mimicking the relatively unamended soils of its native prairies.
