## Care Guide
This moss thrives in environments mimicking its native tropical and subtropical forest floor habitat. Provide low to indirect light, very high humidity, and a consistently moist substrate to ensure optimal growth. Avoid direct sunlight and excessive fertilization for best results.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is needed. If desired, a very diluted liquid fertilizer (1/8 to 1/4 strength) can be applied once or twice a year during active growth.
