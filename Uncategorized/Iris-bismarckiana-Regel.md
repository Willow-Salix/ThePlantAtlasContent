## Care Guide
The Nazareth Iris thrives in full sun and well-draining, rocky soils, mimicking its native Mediterranean habitat. It requires moderate watering during its active growing season in cooler months, followed by a dry dormancy period in summer. Fertilization should be kept low to moderate, applied during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, primarily during the active growth phase, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor, rocky native soils.
