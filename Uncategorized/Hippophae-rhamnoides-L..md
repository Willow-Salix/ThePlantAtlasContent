## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Europe (from the Atlantic coast eastward), Central Asia, Siberia, parts of China and Mongolia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Steppe and Coastal Temperate zones, characterized by open, sunny environments, often with distinct seasons, including cold winters and hot summers. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun is essential for robust growth and optimal fruit production, reflecting its native habitat in open plains, coastal dunes, and riverbanks. |
| **Watering** | Once established, Seaberry is highly drought-tolerant. Young plants require moderate, consistent watering, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot, as it's adapted to well-draining soils. |

## Introduction
Hippophae, from Ancient Greek ἵππος (híppos), meaning "horse", and φάος (pháos), meaning "light", is a genus of flowering plants in the family Elaeagnaceae. They are deciduous shrubs. They are exceptionally hardy plants, able to withstand winter temperatures as low as −43 °C (−45 °F). As Hippophae species develop an aggressive and extensive root system, they are planted to inhibit soil erosion and used in land reclamation for their nitrogen fixing properties, wildlife habitat, and soil enrichment. Hippophae berries and leaves are manufactured into various human and animal food and skincare products.

## Care Guide
Seaberry thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil, mimicking its native open, often pioneer environments. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and needs minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Ensure ample sunlight and good drainage for healthy growth and prolific fruit.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed, especially nitrogen, due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. May benefit from occasional phosphorus and potassium in extremely poor soils.
