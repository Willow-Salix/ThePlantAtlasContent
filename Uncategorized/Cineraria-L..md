## Introduction
Cineraria is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, native primarily to southern Africa with a few species further north. The genus includes herbaceous plants and small subshrubs.
In the past, the genus was commonly viewed in a broader sense including a number of species from the Canary Islands and Madeira which are now transferred to the genus Pericallis, including the florist's cineraria (Pericallis × hybrida).

## Care Guide
Cineraria thrives in cool, moist environments similar to its native montane habitats in Southern Africa. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained. Fertilize sparingly during growth to support healthy foliage and blooms.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize lightly with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season.
