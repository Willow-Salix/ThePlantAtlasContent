## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Tropical Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Savanna (often found in riparian zones, swamps, and seasonal watercourses) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6-8+ hours of direct sunlight daily) to partial sun, as it grows in open areas or along the edges of water bodies. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistent and ample watering, keeping the soil moist but well-drained. It naturally occurs in seasonally wet habitats and can tolerate temporary inundation. |

## Introduction
Sesbania is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, and the only genus found in tribe Sesbanieae. Riverhemp is a common name for plants in this genus. Notable species include the rattlebox (Sesbania punicea), spiny sesbania (Sesbania bispinosa), and Sesbania sesban, which is used in cooking. Plants of this genus, some of which are aquatic, can be used in alley cropping to increase the soil's nitrogen content. The species of rhizobia responsible for nitrogen fixation in Sesbania rostrata is Azorhizobium caulinodans.
Some 60 species are currently accepted, with about 39 still unresolved. The genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, in the Americas from the southern United States to northern Argentina, in sub-Saharan Africa, in southern Asia, and in New Guinea, Australia, and the Pacific. The largest number of species are found in Africa, and the remainder in Australia, Hawaii, and Asia.

## Care Guide
Sesbania Tetraptera thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting its native East African tropical savanna and riparian habitats. Being a nitrogen-fixing legume, it only needs moderate fertilization. Ensure ample water, especially during active growth, as it can tolerate temporary flooding.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil and does not require heavy fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost applied annually in spring should suffice.
