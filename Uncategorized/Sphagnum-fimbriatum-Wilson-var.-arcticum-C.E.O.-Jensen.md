## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic regions, including northern parts of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada), Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Russia), and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Subarctic Peatlands/Bogs. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. While often found in open bogs, it thrives under the lower intensity sun typical of arctic regions and should be protected from intense, direct, hot sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistently waterlogged or saturated conditions are essential; the substrate must never be allowed to dry out. Maintain very high humidity and ideally use rainwater or distilled water to prevent mineral buildup. |

## Introduction
Sphagnum is a genus of approximately 380 accepted species of mosses, commonly known as sphagnum moss, also bog moss and quacker moss (although that term is also sometimes used for peat). Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16 to 26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions.
As Sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. Thus, Sphagnum can influence the composition of such habitats, with some describing Sphagnum as 'habitat manipulators' or 'autogenic ecosystem engineers'. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants.
Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions.
Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, and any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.

## Care Guide
This arctic peat moss variety requires a perpetually waterlogged, acidic, and nutrient-poor environment, replicating its native bog habitat. Provide bright indirect to partial sun and maintain very high humidity, ensuring the substrate never dries out and using only pure water to avoid mineral toxicity.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to no fertilizer required. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic bogs and is highly sensitive to high nutrient levels, which can be detrimental.
