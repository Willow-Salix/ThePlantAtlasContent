## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically California, Baja California, Nevada, and Arizona |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Coastal Salt Marsh (saline environments) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed salt flats and marshes. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established but can also tolerate periods of inundation and highly saline water. |

## Introduction
Frankenia salina, often called alkali heath or alkali seaheath, is a perennial herb native to California, Nevada, Mexico and Chile. It is uncommon even in the region where it is most likely to be found, just north of the San Francisco Bay Area.
It is a squat flowering bush that forms a twiggy thicket near beaches and coastal salt marshes. Its common name refers to its preference for alkaline soils as a halophyte. It has the ability to excrete salt as an adaptation for living in saline habitats. The flowers are pink or fuchsia in color.

## Care Guide
Alkali Heath thrives in full sun and well-draining, often saline or alkaline soils, reflecting its native arid and coastal habitats. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications, and fertilize very sparingly as it is adapted to low-nutrient conditions. This plant is remarkably resilient to drought and high soil salinity.

### Fertilizer
Low; it thrives in nutrient-poor, saline soils and does not require heavy fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
