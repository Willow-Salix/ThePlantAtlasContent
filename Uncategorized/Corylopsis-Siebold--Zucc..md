## Care Guide
Winter Hazel thrives in a temperate forest environment, preferring partial sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide light to moderate fertilization and ensure protection from harsh afternoon sun in warmer climates to mimic its native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Benefits from compost or slow-release granular fertilizer in spring, especially in lean soils.
