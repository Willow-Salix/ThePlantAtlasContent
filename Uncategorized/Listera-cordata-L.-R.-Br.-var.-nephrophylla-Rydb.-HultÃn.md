## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Alaska, Canada, western United States through mountainous regions) |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate to Boreal Coniferous Forest (typically montane or northern), characterized by cool temperatures, high humidity, and often deep shade. |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade. This plant thrives in the understory of dense forests, meaning it needs very little direct sunlight and can be damaged by intense sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil, but well-drained. Its native habitat in damp mossy areas suggests it should never be allowed to dry out completely, but also not sit in stagnant water. |

## Introduction
Neottia cordata, the lesser twayblade or heartleaf twayblade, is an orchid of upland bogs and mires. It was formerly placed in the genus Listera, but molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that Neottia nidus-avis, the bird's-nest orchid, evolved within the same group.
It is never very common but may be frequently overlooked because of its small size and a tendency to grow underneath heather on sphagnum moss.

## Care Guide
This plant requires cool temperatures, high humidity, and very low light conditions, mimicking its native forest understory environment. Keep the soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent rot. Fertilization should be minimal, if any, using highly diluted solutions.

### Fertilizer
Very low. As a terrestrial orchid growing in nutrient-poor forest humus and moss, it requires minimal fertilization. A highly diluted orchid-specific fertilizer once or twice during the growing season, if at all.
