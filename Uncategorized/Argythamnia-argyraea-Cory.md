## 🧤 Care Instructions
Silky Silverbush requires conditions similar to its arid native environment, thriving in full sun and needing very infrequent watering. Ensure excellent drainage and protect it from excessive moisture to maintain its health and distinctive silvery appearance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. This plant thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring if growth appears sluggish.
