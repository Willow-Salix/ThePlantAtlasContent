## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida and Georgia) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (specifically pine flatwoods, savannas, and open woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. As a plant of open flatwoods and savannas, it requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive and flower prolifically. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Native to areas with seasonal rainfall, it prefers consistently moist soil but can tolerate periods of drought once established, especially in well-draining soils. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Silphium (also known as laserwort or laser; Ancient Greek: σίλφιον, sílphion) is an unidentified plant that was used in classical antiquity as a seasoning, perfume, aphrodisiac, and medicine.
It was an essential item of trade from the ancient North African city of Cyrene, and was so critical to the Cyrenian economy that most of their coins bore an image of the plant. The valuable product was the plant's resin, called in Latin laserpicium, lasarpicium, or laser (Laserpitium and Laser were used by botanists to name genera of aromatic plants, but the silphium plant is not believed to belong to these genera).
The exact identity of silphium is unclear. It was claimed to have become extinct in Roman times, but is commonly believed to be a relative of giant fennel in the genus Ferula. The extant plant Thapsia gummifera has been suggested as another possibility. Another theory is that it was simply a high-quality variety of asafoetida, a common spice in the Roman Empire. The two spices were considered the same by many Romans, including geographer Strabo.
Silphium was considered invaluable by all who held it. The plant was sung about by Roman poets and singers, who considered it equivalent to its weight in gold. Historically, Pliny the Elder blamed silphium's valuation on "tax-farmers", and Julius Caesar directly registered silphium as "1500 pounds of laser" in the Roman treasury.

## Care Guide
Simpson's Rosinweed thrives in full sun to partial sun exposure with moderate, consistent watering, particularly during dry periods. It is well-adapted to average to poor soils and typically requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance perennial. Ensure good drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to average to poor, often sandy, soils. Heavy fertilization is usually not necessary and can lead to leggy growth. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring may be beneficial in very nutrient-deficient soils.
