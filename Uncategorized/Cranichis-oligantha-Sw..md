## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across Central America, parts of South America (e.g., Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil), and the Caribbean (e.g., Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico). |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; it naturally grows on the shaded forest floor or mossy banks beneath a canopy. Direct sun should be avoided. |
| **Watering** | Keep the substrate consistently moist but never waterlogged, ensuring excellent drainage. Its native habitat of wet mossy banks indicates a need for constant hydration, coupled with high ambient humidity. |

## Care Guide
To care for Cranichis oligantha, replicate its tropical montane rainforest habitat by providing consistent moisture to the substrate, very high humidity, and dappled or indirect light. Ensure the potting medium offers excellent drainage to prevent root rot while staying moist.

### Fertilizer
Apply a diluted (1/4 to 1/2 strength) balanced orchid-specific fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during its active growing season. Terrestrial orchids typically benefit from nutrients provided by decomposing organic matter.
