## Introduction
Navarretia is a genus of flowering plants related to the phloxes and the gilias. This is one genus of plants, among others, which are sometimes called pincushion plants. It includes 45 species native to the Americas. In North America they range from western Canada through the western and west-central United States to northwestern Mexico, and to Ohio and Pennsylvania. In South America they range through Argentina and Chile.
The inflorescence which bears the flowers is surrounded by frilly green bracts bearing soft spines, giving it the appearance of a pincushion. Several species are members of the vernal pool ecosystem.

## Care Guide
This annual plant demands a precise seasonal watering cycle, mirroring its native vernal pool environment. Provide full sun and ensure continuously wet soil during its winter to spring growth phase. Allow the soil to dry out completely during summer and fall for dormancy, as it prefers lean, unfertilized conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; this plant thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately lean soils typical of its native habitat.
