## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Globally widespread in temperate and subtropical regions, including parts of Europe, North America, Africa, and Australia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical, often found in open, well-lit areas with moderate humidity and good air quality. |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure. This lichen typically thrives in open, exposed locations on tree bark or rocks, requiring significant direct or indirect sunlight. |
| **Watering** | As a lichen, it absorbs moisture directly from the atmosphere (rain, dew, mist) rather than through roots. It requires periods of wetness for metabolic activity, followed by complete drying out. In cultivation, regular misting in a high humidity environment is crucial, but avoid constant wetness. |

## Introduction
Teloschistes is a genus of lichens in the family Teloschistaceae, of which it is the namesake. It was circumscribed by Norwegian botanist Johannes Musaeus Norman in 1852. The name of the genus means "split ends". The genus was originally described as Borrera by Swedish lichenologist Erik Archarius, after English botanist William Borrer, but this name was rejected.

## Care Guide
The Candle Lichen thrives in high sun exposure and requires clean air. It absorbs all its moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere, needing cycles of wetting and drying. Avoid any traditional fertilizers, as they are harmful to lichens.

### Fertilizer
No direct fertilization is needed or tolerated. Lichens are highly sensitive to excess nutrients and pollution, deriving their minimal requirements from the air and substrate. Traditional fertilizers are detrimental.
