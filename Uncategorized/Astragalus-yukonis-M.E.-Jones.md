## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun with highly well-drained, lean soil, typical of subarctic open floodplains. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid over-fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is typically needed, as it is a legume and can fix nitrogen. If growth is poor, a very lean, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
