## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Montane and Desert Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial sun, thriving in open, exposed areas typical of its native habitat where sunlight is abundant. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent, deep watering. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking the sparse rainfall of its native arid environment. |

## Care Guide
Arizona Fleabane thrives in conditions similar to its native arid montane and desert scrubland. Provide full to partial sun and well-draining soil, watering infrequently once established. It requires minimal fertilization, preferring lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in lean to average, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
