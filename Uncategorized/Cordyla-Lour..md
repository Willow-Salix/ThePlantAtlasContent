## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Africa, primarily West Africa (e.g., Senegal, Mali, Nigeria) and Madagascar |
| **Climate** | Tropical Savanna and Dry Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure is preferred, mimicking its open savanna habitat. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular watering during its active growing season (mimicking the wet season), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly tolerant of drought conditions during a dry or dormant period. |

## Care Guide
Cordyla plants thrive in full sun conditions, replicating their native tropical savanna environment. They require a distinct wet season with regular watering, followed by a dry period where water is significantly reduced. These hardy plants are drought-tolerant and benefit from moderate fertilization during their active growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, so less nitrogen may be required.
