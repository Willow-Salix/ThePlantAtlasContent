## Care Guide
This plant thrives in sunny, well-draining conditions characteristic of its native Mediterranean climate. Water moderately during its active spring growth, ensuring the soil dries completely between sessions, and allow for summer dormancy. Its drought tolerance and preference for lean soils make it suitable for low-maintenance, arid-adapted gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Typically thrives in average to poor soils. If necessary, a light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be given in early spring.
