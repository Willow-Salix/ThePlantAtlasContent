## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico) and Northern Mexico (Sonora, Chihuahua) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Semi-Arid Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring full sun in cooler climates or partial shade in hotter, desert-like conditions. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate watering; native to regions with seasonal rainfall, it prefers well-drained soil and tolerates drought once established. Allow soil to dry out between waterings. |

## Introduction
Ageratina, commonly known as snakeroot, is a genus of over 300 species of perennials and rounded shrubs in the family Asteraceae.
These plants grow mainly in the warmer regions of the Americas and West Indies. Over 150 species are native to Mexico. Some flourish in the cooler areas of the eastern United States. Two Mexican species have become a pest in parts of Australia and Taiwan. Ageratina used to belong to the genus Eupatorium, but it has been reclassified.
The genus name Ageratina means "like Ageratum" and consists of Ageratum and -ina, the feminine form of the Latin adjectival suffix -inus.

## Care Guide
Lemmon's Snakeroot thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions, mimicking its native arid and semi-arid scrubland habitat. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal fertilization, preferring to dry out between waterings. This plant is best suited for xeriscaping or gardens with similar low-water requirements.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilization needs; native soils are often rocky and lean. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is generally sufficient, or none if soil is naturally fertile.
