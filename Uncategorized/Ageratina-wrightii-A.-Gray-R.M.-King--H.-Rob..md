## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-Arid Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, ideally receiving at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day due to its open habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent to moderate watering; highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its native arid conditions. |

## Introduction
Ageratina, commonly known as snakeroot, is a genus of over 300 species of perennials and rounded shrubs in the family Asteraceae.
These plants grow mainly in the warmer regions of the Americas and West Indies. Over 150 species are native to Mexico. Some flourish in the cooler areas of the eastern United States. Two Mexican species have become a pest in parts of Australia and Taiwan. Ageratina used to belong to the genus Eupatorium, but it has been reclassified.
The genus name Ageratina means "like Ageratum" and consists of Ageratum and -ina, the feminine form of the Latin adjectival suffix -inus.

## Care Guide
Wright's snakeroot thrives in conditions similar to its native arid and semi-arid regions. Provide full to partial sun, well-draining soil, and water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely. Fertilization is generally not required.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Native soils are typically lean, so rich fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental.
