## 🧤 Care Instructions
Elliott's Goldenrod requires consistently wet to very moist soil and thrives in full to partial sun, mimicking its native humid subtropical wetland habitats. It generally tolerates average to poor soils, thus requiring minimal fertilization. Ensure the soil never dries out to promote healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not a heavy feeder. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer may be beneficial in very poor soils, but often thrives without supplemental feeding.
