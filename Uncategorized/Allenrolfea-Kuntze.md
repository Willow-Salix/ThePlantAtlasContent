## Care Guide
This plant thrives in harsh, arid conditions, demanding full sun and extremely minimal watering. Its adaptation to saline, nutrient-poor soils means it requires little to no fertilization and is highly susceptible to overwatering.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Thrives in poor, often saline and alkaline soils, and does not require regular fertilization.
