## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions, including Europe (e.g., Great Britain, Fennoscandia) and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically humid, often old-growth, deciduous forests). |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate indirect light. Prefers shaded or dappled light conditions, avoiding direct harsh sunlight which can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High atmospheric humidity is essential. This lichen does not require soil watering, absorbing moisture directly from the air and occasional rainfall. Regular misting in dry environments is critical to prevent desiccation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Thelenella is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Thelenellaceae. These inconspicuous lichens form thin, crust-like growths that are tightly attached to their substrates and appear as dull whitish, pale grey, or light brown patches. Species of Thelenella are commonly found in damp, shaded environments where they grow on tree bark, living leaves, moss cushions, rock faces, and moss-rich soil. The genus is distinguished by its thick-walled fruiting bodies that are mostly embedded within the lichen crust and contain multicellular spores with multiple cross-walls.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a crustose lichen, Thelenella pertusariella thrives in high humidity and low to moderate indirect light, typically on tree bark in temperate forests. It requires no soil or traditional fertilizers, instead relying on atmospheric moisture and nutrients. Maintaining a consistently humid environment is paramount for its survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens derive necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate (e.g., tree bark). Application of conventional fertilizers can be detrimental.
