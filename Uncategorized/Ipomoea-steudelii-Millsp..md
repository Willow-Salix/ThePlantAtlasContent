## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central America and the Caribbean (e.g., Mexico, Guatemala, Cuba, Puerto Rico) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry to Moist Forest (Seasonal) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, ideally receiving at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to encourage robust growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Water regularly and deeply during the active growing season, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerant of short dry spells once established, reflecting its native seasonal climate. |

## Introduction
Ipomoea () is the largest genus in the plant family Convolvulaceae, with over 600 species. It is a large and diverse group, with common names including morning glory, water convolvulus or water spinach, sweet potato, bindweed, moonflower, etc. The genus occurs throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and comprises annual and perennial herbaceous plants, lianas, shrubs, and small trees; most of the species are twining climbing plants.
Their most widespread common name is morning glory, but some species in related genera bear that same common name and some Ipomoea species are known by different common names. Those formerly separated in Calonyction (Greek καλός kalós "good" and νύξ, νυκτός núx, nuktós, "night") are called moonflowers. The name Ipomoea is derived from the Ancient Greek ἴψ, meaning 'woodworm', and ὅμοιος (hómoios), meaning "resembling". It refers to their twining habit.

## Care Guide
Steudel's Morning-Glory thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistent moisture during its growing season, becoming more drought-tolerant once established. Provide moderate fertilization to support its vigorous climbing nature, mimicking the nutrient cycling in its native tropical seasonal forest environment.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize with a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Less fertile soil is tolerated, but moderate feeding promotes vigorous vine growth.
