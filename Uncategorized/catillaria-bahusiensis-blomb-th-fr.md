## 🧤 Care Instructions
This crustose lichen thrives in humid, temperate oceanic climates, typically on the bark of old deciduous trees. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and ensure consistent high humidity with access to clean air. Conventional watering or fertilization methods are not applicable, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable for conventional fertilization. Nutrients are absorbed from atmospheric deposition and rainfall, along with the organic matter on its substrate.
