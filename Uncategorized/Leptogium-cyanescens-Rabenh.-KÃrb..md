## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in humid temperate and subtropical regions globally, including parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate and Subtropical Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Low to partial indirect light; prefers shaded conditions, mimicking the understory of dense forests. |
| **Watering** | Requires very high humidity and consistent moisture; sensitive to drought. Frequent misting or placement in a terrarium/humid environment is crucial. |

## Introduction
Leptogium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Collemataceae. It has about 110 species. Species formerly classified under Leptogium have since been divided among the genera Leptogium, Pseudoleptogium, and Scytinium. Leptogium lichens are predominantly found on tree bark or soil, often among mosses, and sometimes on rocks in moist environments.

## Care Guide
Skin lichen thrives in environments with very high humidity and low, indirect light, mimicking its native forest understory habitat. It does not require traditional fertilization and is sensitive to dry conditions, necessitating consistent moisture and atmospheric humidity.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens absorb trace nutrients from the air and rain; excess nutrients can be detrimental.
