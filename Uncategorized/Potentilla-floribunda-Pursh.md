## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal, encompassing regions across North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Alaska, Canada), Europe, and Asia (e.g., Siberia, Himalayas, China). |
| **Climate** | Cold Temperate to Subarctic (e.g., Boreal Forest margins, Alpine Meadows, Montane regions, Tundra fringes). |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Native habitats in open fields, meadows, and rocky slopes suggest a preference for at least 6 hours of direct sunlight, though it can tolerate some afternoon shade, especially in warmer climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Found in areas with consistent but not excessive moisture, such as near stream banks or moist meadows. Requires regular watering to maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during dry periods or establishment, but can tolerate some drought once mature. |

## Care Guide
This highly adaptable plant thrives in cooler, cold temperate to subarctic climates and prefers full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering to prevent drying out, particularly during establishment, and minimal fertilization, making it a resilient and low-maintenance garden shrub.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in a variety of soils, including lean and rocky types, indicating it is not a heavy feeder. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or enrichment with compost, is usually sufficient.
