## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and alpine regions across North America (e.g., Alaska, Canadian Arctic) and Europe |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High, direct exposure, typical of open rock surfaces above the tree line. Can tolerate periods of lower light during overcast conditions or polar winters. |
| **Watering** | Relies on atmospheric moisture, snowmelt, and rainfall for hydration. Requires consistent humidity and occasional rehydration, but can tolerate periods of desiccation. |

## Introduction
Porpidia is a genus of crustose lichens in the family Lecideaceae. Porpidia species primarily inhabit siliceous rocks, pebbles, and stonework, with rare occurrences on bark, wood, and compacted soil. The thallus, or body of the lichen, varies in appearance from thick and crusty to barely visible. It may form a continuous layer or develop cracks resulting in a segmented, areolate structure. The colour of the thallus ranges from grey and white to orange.

## Care Guide
This alpine/arctic lichen thrives in high light conditions, typically growing on siliceous rocks in open environments. It relies on atmospheric moisture, snowmelt, and rainfall for hydration, absorbing water directly from its surroundings. Traditional watering and fertilization are not suitable and should be avoided.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization needed. Lichens derive nutrients from the air and rock substrate; added fertilizers are likely to be detrimental.
