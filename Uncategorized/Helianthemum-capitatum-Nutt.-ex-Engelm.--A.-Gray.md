## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and flowering, typical of its exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Prefers infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions; highly drought-tolerant once established due to its arid native climate. |

## Introduction
Helianthemum (), known as rock rose, sunrose, rushrose, or frostweed, is a genus of about 110 species of flowering plants in the family Cistaceae. They are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, especially in the Mediterranean.
New World species formerly classified as Helianthemum have been transferred to genus Crocanthemum.

## Care Guide
Hoary Sunrose thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its native arid scrubland environment. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and has minimal fertilizer needs, making it ideal for xeriscaping or rock gardens.

### Fertilizer
Generally requires minimal to no fertilization; thrives in lean, well-drained soils. Over-fertilization can reduce flowering and promote leggy growth.
