## Introduction
Stipa is a genus of about 140 species of large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and  spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to Stipa, which have since been reclassified into new genera.
Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as Stipa brachytricha, S. arundinacea, S. splendens, S. gigantea and S. pulchra are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.
It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.

## Care Guide
This arid-adapted grass thrives in full sun and very well-draining soils. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering and no regular fertilization. Avoid overwatering and rich soils to mimic its natural, lean growing conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Thrives in lean, well-draining soils; excessive fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental.
