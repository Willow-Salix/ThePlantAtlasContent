## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America, Caribbean, northern South America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Woodlands and Edges |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, favoring full sun for optimal flowering and growth. Its native habitat in open areas suggests it tolerates intense light. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. Its presence in areas with seasonal rainfall patterns indicates it can handle some dry periods but thrives with consistent moisture during active growth. |

## 🌱 Overview
Salvia coccinea, the blood sage, scarlet sage, Texas sage, or tropical sage, is a herbaceous perennial  in the family Lamiaceae that is widespread throughout the Southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America (Colombia, Peru, and Brazil). At one time Brazil was considered to be where it originated, but its diploid chromosome count now points to Mexico as its place of origin.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Blood Sage flourishes in warm, sunny conditions typical of its native subtropical to tropical woodlands. Provide full sun and consistent, moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to average soil fertility.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient. In its native disturbed or average soils, it is not accustomed to highly fertile conditions.
