## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate, boreal, and arctic-alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, high light exposure, often found on open and unprotected siliceous rock surfaces, tolerating intense UV radiation. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies on atmospheric moisture (rain, snowmelt, fog, dew); highly tolerant of desiccation and rehydration cycles. Does not require watering in the traditional sense, as it absorbs water directly from the environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rhizocarpon is a genus of crustose, saxicolous (or sometimes lichenicolous), lecideoid lichens in the family Rhizocarpaceae. The genus is common in arctic-alpine environments, but also occurs throughout temperate, subtropical, and even tropical regions. They are commonly known as map lichens because of the prothallus forming border-like bands between colonies in some species, like the common map lichen (Rhizocarpon geographicum).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a crustose lichen, Rhizocarpon penichrum thrives in full sun and exposed conditions typical of alpine tundra and high-altitude rocky environments. It absorbs moisture directly from atmospheric sources like rain and dew, tolerating cycles of drought and rehydration. This organism requires no traditional watering or fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor substrates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient requirements; thrives on nutrient-poor rocky substrates and obtains necessary trace elements from airborne dust and precipitation. No supplemental fertilization is needed.
