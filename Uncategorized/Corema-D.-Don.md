## Care Guide
Corema thrives in full sun and well-drained, acidic soils characteristic of its native heathland and coastal environments. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and apply fertilizer sparingly as it is adapted to low-nutrient conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; requires minimal fertilization, preferring nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
