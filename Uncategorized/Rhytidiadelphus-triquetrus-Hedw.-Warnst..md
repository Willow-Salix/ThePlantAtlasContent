## Care Guide
This moss thrives in environments mimicking its native forest floor, requiring low to medium indirect light and consistently high humidity. Maintain a damp (not wet) substrate and avoid any direct, intense sunlight to prevent desiccation. It has minimal nutrient needs and benefits from stable, cool conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient requirements; fertilization is generally unnecessary or should be extremely diluted if used.
