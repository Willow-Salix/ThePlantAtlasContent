## Introduction
Ambrosia salsola, commonly called cheesebush, winged ragweed, burrobush, white burrobrush, and desert pearl, is a species of perennial shrub in the family Asteraceae native to deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.
This species, notable for its foul smell, easily hybridizes with the white bur-sage (Ambrosia dumosa).

## Care Guide
Burrobrush requires full sun exposure and extremely well-draining soil, replicating its native arid habitats. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between applications, and avoid over-fertilization as it thrives in poor nutrient conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Thrives in poor, nutrient-deficient soils typical of desert environments. Fertilization is generally not necessary.
