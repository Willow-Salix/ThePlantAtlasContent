## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah) and northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure is essential, mimicking its native open desert habitat where it receives direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and deep watering is necessary, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to simulate desert rainfall patterns and prevent root rot. Established plants are highly drought-tolerant. |

## Introduction
Asclepias is a genus of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants known as milkweeds, named for their latex, a milky substance containing cardiac glycosides termed cardenolides, exuded where cells are damaged. Most species are toxic to humans and many other species, primarily due to the presence of cardenolides. However, as with many such plants, some species feed upon milkweed leaves or the nectar from their flowers. A noteworthy feeder on milkweeds is the monarch butterfly, which uses and requires certain milkweeds as host plants for its larvae.
The Asclepias genus contains over 200 species distributed broadly across Africa, North America, and South America. It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.

## Care Guide
Desert Milkweed thrives in conditions mimicking its arid native environment, requiring abundant full sun and extremely well-draining soil. Water sparingly, only after the soil has thoroughly dried, as it is highly drought-tolerant once established. Avoid excessive fertilization as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is needed; its native desert soils are typically lean. If necessary, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring would suffice, but it often thrives without any.
