## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
The Roan Mountain Hawthorn is a resilient plant thriving in full sun to partial shade, preferring consistent moisture in well-drained soil, yet tolerating some drought once mature. Minimal fertilization is typically required, with a focus on healthy soil through organic matter.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring or a layer of compost can benefit growth, especially in poor soils.
