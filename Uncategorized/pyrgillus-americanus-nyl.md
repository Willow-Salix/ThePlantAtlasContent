## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pyrgillus americanus, an epiphytic lichen, thrives in environments replicating its native tropical and subtropical humid forests. Provide high humidity through regular misting and ensure it receives indirect to partial shade, avoiding any direct sun. No supplemental feeding is generally needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. Lichens derive most of their nutrients from the atmosphere and their substrate; typical plant fertilizers can be detrimental.
