## Introduction
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. Species are distributed widely – from Quebec to northern Argentina in the Americas, across northern and southern tropical Africa, in the southern Arabian Peninsula, in Myanmar and Thailand, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia.

## Care Guide
Desmodium podocarpum prefers partial to full sun and consistent moisture during its growing season, reflecting its native temperate to subtropical woodland environment. Being a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires low to moderate fertilization, avoiding excessive nitrogen. Overall, it's a relatively easy-care plant suited to garden edges or open areas.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen fertilizer is unnecessary. A balanced, general-purpose fertilizer or compost applied sparingly can be beneficial.
