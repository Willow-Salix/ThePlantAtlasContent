## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically mountainous regions of California, Oregon, Washington, and Nevada, USA) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine and Alpine Zones |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun, but can tolerate partial sun, reflecting its growth in open, high-elevation environments. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate and consistent moisture during the growing season, with excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging, mimicking its native rocky, well-drained soils. |

## Introduction
Phacelia (phacelia, scorpionweed, heliotrope) is a genus of about 200 species of annual or perennial herbaceous plants in the borage family, native to North and South America. California is particularly rich in species with over 90 recorded in the region.
The genus is traditionally placed at family rank with the waterleafs (Hydrophyllaceae) in the order Boraginales. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, recognizing that the traditional Boraginaceae and Hydrophyllaceae are paraphyletic with respect to each other, merges the latter into the former and considers the family basal in the Euasterids I clade. Other botanists continue to recognize the Hydrophyllaceae and Boraginales after analysing the secondary structure of the ITS1 genetic region rather than its sequence for these higher taxonomic levels.  This placed Phacelia within the Hydrophyllaceae. Further molecular taxonomic analysis of the Boraginales has divided the Boraginales in two and placed Phacelia among the monophyletic herbaceous Hydrophyllaceae in Boraginales II.
The genus includes both annual and perennial species. Many have been cultivated as garden and honey plants.
There are reports that glandular hairs of stems, flowers and leaves of some species of Phacelia secrete oil droplets that can cause an unpleasant skin rash (contact dermatitis) in some people, specifically from P. brachyloba, P. campanularia, P. crenulata, P. gina-glenneae, P. grandiflora, P. ixodes, P. minor, and P. pedicellata. The major contact allergen of P. crenulata has been identified as geranylhydroquinone and of P. minor as geranylgeranylhydroquinone.
The mining bee Andrena phaceliae is a specialist pollinator of this genus in the Eastern United States.

## Care Guide
Tall Phacelia thrives in full to partial sun, typical of its native subalpine and alpine habitats in western North America. It requires moderate and consistent watering during its growing season, ensuring excellent drainage as it naturally grows in rocky, lean soils. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to less nutrient-rich environments.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; adapted to lean, rocky soils. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth appears weak.
