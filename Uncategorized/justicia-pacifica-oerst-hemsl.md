## 🧤 Care Instructions
Runyon's Water-Willow thrives in warm, humid conditions with partial shade or bright indirect light, reflecting its native tropical forest understory. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from moderate feeding during its active growth period. Ensure protection from intense direct sunlight to prevent leaf damage.
