## Care Guide
This tropical grass thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistent moisture during its active growth, with reduced watering in drier seasons. It benefits from moderate fertilization to support its robust growth, mirroring its native habitat in open, often disturbed, areas of tropical and subtropical Asia and Australia.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied during the active growth period (spring and summer) to support vigorous growth, especially in areas with nutrient-leached soils.
