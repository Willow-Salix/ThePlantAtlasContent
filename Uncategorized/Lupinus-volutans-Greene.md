## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pinyon Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, reflecting its arid montane origins. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and needs very minimal or no fertilizer due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed, especially nitrogen. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen and prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils.
