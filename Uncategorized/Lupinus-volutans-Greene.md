## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Pinyon Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, reflecting its arid montane origins. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and needs very minimal or no fertilizer due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed, especially nitrogen. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen and prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils.
