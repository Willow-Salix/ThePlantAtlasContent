## Care Guide
Koehler's rockcress thrives in full to partial sun with extremely well-draining soil, mimicking its native serpentine habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering, especially during dry summers. Avoid over-fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
