## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma), extending into parts of Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Dry Forest / Montane Forest, characterized by distinct seasons, cold winters, warm dry summers, and moderate rainfall. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial shade. In hotter climates, some afternoon shade can be beneficial to prevent leaf scorch, especially when young. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate watering when young to establish. Mature trees are notably drought-tolerant but will benefit from supplemental watering during prolonged dry periods to maintain vigor. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy maple is well-adapted to temperate climates with cold winters and warm, often dry, summers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Once established, it is relatively drought-tolerant but appreciates consistent moisture during extended dry spells for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is typically needed for established trees in healthy soil. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if growth is poor or soil nutrients are lacking.
