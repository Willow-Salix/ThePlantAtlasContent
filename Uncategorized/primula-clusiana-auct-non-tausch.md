## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern Alps (Austria, Slovenia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra/Subalpine Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure with cool roots; ideally full sun in morning and afternoon shade, or bright indirect light all day, mimicking high-altitude conditions above the treeline. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Requires consistently moist but very well-drained soil, especially during the growing season. Avoid waterlogging, which can lead to rot. Tolerates drier conditions once established but thrives with steady moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Primula () is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. They include the primrose (P. vulgaris), a familiar wildflower of banks and verges. Other common species are P. auricula (auricula), P. veris (cowslip), and P. elatior (oxlip). These species and many others are valued for their ornamental flowers. They have been extensively cultivated and hybridised (in the case of the primrose, for many hundreds of years). Primula are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, south into tropical mountains in Ethiopia, Indonesia, and New Guinea, and in temperate southern South America. Almost half of the known species are from the Himalayas.
Primula has over 500 species in traditional treatments, and more if certain related genera are included within its circumscription.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine primrose thrives in conditions mimicking its native Eastern Alps habitat. Provide bright, cool light and consistently moist, extremely well-drained soil. Minimal fertilization is needed to ensure healthy growth and abundant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Benefits from a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, or compost tea. Avoid excessive fertilization, which can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
