## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coastal Rocky Outcrops |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers bright, direct light, especially for best color and compact growth. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent; allow soil to dry completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to rot if overwatered. |

## Introduction
Sedum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, members of which are commonly known as stonecrops. The genus has been described as containing up to 600 species, subsequently reduced to 400–500. They are leaf succulents found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, but extending into the southern hemisphere in Africa and South America. The plants vary from annual and creeping herbs to shrubs. The plants have water-storing leaves. The flowers usually have five petals, seldom four or six. There are typically twice as many stamens as petals. Various species formerly classified as Sedum are now in the segregate genera Hylotelephium and Rhodiola.
Well-known European species of Sedum are Sedum acre, Sedum album, Sedum dasyphyllum, and Sedum hispanicum.

## Care Guide
This resilient, drought-tolerant succulent thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native rocky coastal habitats. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to fully dry out between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization to ensure healthy, compact growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; if desired, a very diluted low-nitrogen or balanced succulent fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
