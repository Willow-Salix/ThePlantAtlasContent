| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine and Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), mimicking its open, high-elevation native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, consistent moisture during the growing season, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings; requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot, typical of its rocky native soils. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rydberg's fleabane thrives in conditions that mimic its native subalpine and alpine environment. Provide full sun and ensure very well-draining soil, maintaining moderate moisture during the active growing period. Minimal fertilization is needed for this hardy, high-altitude plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required; its native alpine soils are typically lean. If necessary, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once early in the growing season.
