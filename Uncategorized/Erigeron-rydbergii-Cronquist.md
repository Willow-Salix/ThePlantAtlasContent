## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains, including states like Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine and Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), mimicking its open, high-elevation native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate, consistent moisture during the growing season, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings; requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot, typical of its rocky native soils. |

## Introduction
Erigeron () is a large genus of plants in the composite family (Asteraceae). It is placed in the tribe Astereae and is closely related to the Old World asters (Aster) and the true daisies (Bellis). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and the highest diversity occurs in North America.

## Care Guide
Rydberg's fleabane thrives in conditions that mimic its native subalpine and alpine environment. Provide full sun and ensure very well-draining soil, maintaining moderate moisture during the active growing period. Minimal fertilization is needed for this hardy, high-altitude plant.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required; its native alpine soils are typically lean. If necessary, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once early in the growing season.
