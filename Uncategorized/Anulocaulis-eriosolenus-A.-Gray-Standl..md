## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Chihuahuan Desert region, particularly Big Bend, Texas, USA |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, mimicking its native open desert environment. |
| **Watering** | Very low; extremely drought-tolerant. Water sparingly and infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering, especially in cooler months, can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Anulocaulis is a small genus of flowering plants known generally as ringstems. These five species are sometimes treated as members of genus Boerhavia. Ringstems are thickly-rooted perennial wildflowers with glutinous brown bands at their stem internodes, the trait which gives them their common and Latin names. They bear tubular flowers at the tops of their stems. Ringstems are native to North America.

## Care Guide
The Big Bend Ringstem is a desert plant that demands full sun and excellent drainage to mimic its native arid conditions. It is highly drought-tolerant, so infrequent watering is crucial, with soil allowed to dry completely between sessions. Minimal to no fertilization is required for this robust species.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Native desert soils are typically poor in nutrients, so this plant does not require heavy fertilization. A single application of a very diluted, balanced fertilizer during its active growing period (spring/early summer) is sufficient if desired.
