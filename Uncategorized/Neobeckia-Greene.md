## Introduction
Rorippa aquatica (syns. Neobeckia aquatica and Armoracia lacustris), the lakecress or lake cress, is a species of freshwater aquatic flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is found in eastern and central North America, generally in the Great Lakes and Mississippi watersheds. A submerged perennial, it has emergent flowering branches. It is typically found in slow-moving water, such as oxbow lakes. It is used as a foreground aquarium plant, as it is undemanding and very slow-growing.

## Care Guide
Lakecress thrives in temperate freshwater wetland environments, requiring full to partial sun exposure and consistently submerged or very wet conditions. It needs a nutrient-rich substrate or regular aquatic fertilization to support its growth as an aquatic plant.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high; benefits from nutrient-rich aquatic substrate or regular application of aquatic plant fertilizer.
