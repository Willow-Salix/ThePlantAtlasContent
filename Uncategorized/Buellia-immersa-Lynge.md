## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Alpine regions, including Greenland, Svalbard, and Arctic Canada |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra / Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright indirect light to full sun in cool conditions. It tolerates periods of low light but should be protected from intense, scorching sun which can cause desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular atmospheric moisture, such as misting or high humidity, followed by periods of drying. Mimic natural rainfall and evaporation cycles, ensuring good air circulation to prevent prolonged saturation. |

## Introduction
Buellia is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Caliciaceae. The fungi are usually part of a crustose lichen. In this case, the lichen species is given the same name as the fungus. But members may also grow as parasites on lichens (lichenicolous). The algae in the lichen (the photobiont partner) is always a member of the genus Trebouxia.
Lichens in the genus are commonly called disc lichens, or button lichens. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains almost 1000 species.
Genetic studies indicate that the genus Amandinea and Buellia may be the same, although this is not widely accepted.
The genus Buellia was described by Italian botanist Gioseppe De Notaris in 1846 and named after his friend, Esperanzo Buelli.

## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine lichen thrives in cool, bright conditions with regular atmospheric moisture. Provide bright indirect light to full sun, ensuring periods of wetness followed by drying, and avoid any fertilization as it is sensitive to high nutrient levels.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens are highly sensitive to concentrated nutrients and can be harmed by traditional fertilizers.
