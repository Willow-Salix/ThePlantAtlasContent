## Introduction
Chorizanthe is a genus of plants in the buckwheat family known generally as spineflowers. These are small, squat, herbaceous plants with spiny-looking inflorescences of flowers. The flowers may be in shades of red or yellow to white. The bracts are pointed and sometimes tipped with a hooked awn, and the inflorescence often dries into a rounded, spiny husk. Spineflowers are found in western North America and South America.
Name derivation: The word Chorizanthe comes from the Greek roots chorizo and anthos meaning "to divide," and "flower," thus meaning "divided flowers," but actually used in reference to the divided calyx.

## Care Guide
The Fernandina Spineflower is a resilient California native adapted to Mediterranean scrublands, requiring full sun and well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing very minimal water once established and prefers no summer irrigation. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization to ensure optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
