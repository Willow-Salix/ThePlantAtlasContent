## Introduction
Pyrola asarifolia, commonly known as liverleaf wintergreen, bog wintergreen or pink wintergreen, is a plant species of the genus Pyrola native to western North America. It is found primarily on forest margins at mid latitude in the Pacific Northwest and northern California.  It is so named simply because its leaves maintain their green color through winter.

## Care Guide
Bog Wintergreen thrives in cool, deeply shaded, and consistently wet environments, typical of boreal bogs and wetlands. It requires acidic, nutrient-poor soil and constant moisture, while avoiding direct sunlight and heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic, peaty soils; fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
