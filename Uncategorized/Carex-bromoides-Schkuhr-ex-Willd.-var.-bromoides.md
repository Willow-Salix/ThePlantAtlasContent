## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
To care for Brome Sedge, replicate its native wetland conditions by providing consistently moist to wet soil and ensuring it never dries out. Position in partial sun to partial shade, allowing for dappled light. Fertilize lightly during the growing season to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release granular or diluted liquid fertilizer applied once or twice during the active growing season is generally sufficient. Over-fertilization can be harmful.
