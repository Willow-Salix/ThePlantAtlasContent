## Care Guide
This tropical vine thrives in conditions mimicking its native rainforest, requiring bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide moderate fertilization during active growth to support its vigorous habit and maintain high humidity if possible.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, typically every 2-4 weeks.
