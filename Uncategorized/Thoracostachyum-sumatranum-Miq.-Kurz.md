## Care Guide
To care for Thoracostachyum sumatranum, replicate its tropical swamp forest environment by providing ample shade and maintaining consistently wet, humid conditions. Ensure the soil never dries out, and fertilize sparingly during its active growth period to support its robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season, applied infrequently (e.g., every 4-6 weeks) given the often nutrient-poor conditions of peat swamps.
