## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Mojave Desert region of California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah) and Northwestern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Desert Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly or cease during cooler, dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Encelia is a genus of the plant family Asteraceae whose members are frequently called brittlebushes. It consists of shrubs (and one geophyte) of arid environments in southwestern North America and western South America.
All have n = 18 chromosomes. All the North American species are obligate outcrossers. In cultivation, the species readily form fertile F1 hybrids, F2s, and backcrosses, but in natural areas of sympatry, F2s and backcrosses are absent or rare.
Encelia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the leaf miner Bucculatrix enceliae which feeds exclusively on Encelia farinosa.
The phylogenetic sister group of Encelia is a clade comprising the genera Enceliopsis and Geraea. The three genera are informally called the "Encelia alliance".
Encelia is named in honor of German biologist Christophorus Enzelius, 1517–1583.

## Care Guide
Acton's Brittlebush is a resilient desert plant that demands full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its arid native environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent, deep watering once established, with soil completely drying out between sessions. Fertilization is seldom necessary, making it an ideal, low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Very low; rarely requires fertilization. If grown in pots or exceptionally poor soil, a very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring, but it's generally unnecessary for established garden plants.
