## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico, Central America, Caribbean (including Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico), and northern South America (including Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest to Lower Montane Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade, avoiding direct midday sun, especially in warmer climates, as it typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte under a tree canopy. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial; water frequently, allowing the substrate to approach dryness but not fully dry out between waterings. High humidity is also essential, mimicking its cloud forest environment. |

## Introduction
Epidendrum , abbreviated Epi in the horticultural trade, is a large neotropical genus of the orchid family. With more than 1,500 species,  some authors describe it as a mega-genus. The genus name (from Greek επί, epi and δένδρον, dendron, "upon trees") refers to its epiphytic growth habit.
When Carl Linnaeus named this genus in 1763, he included in this genus all the epiphytic orchids known to him. Although few of these orchids are still included in the genus Epidendrum, some species of Epidendrum are nevertheless not epiphytic.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic or lithophytic orchid thrives in bright indirect light and very high humidity, similar to its native tropical and cloud forest environments. Maintain consistent moisture in the substrate, allowing for slight drying between waterings, and feed with a diluted orchid fertilizer during active growth periods.

### Fertilizer
Light, balanced orchid fertilizer applied every 2-4 weeks at half strength during the active growing season, less frequently during dormancy.
