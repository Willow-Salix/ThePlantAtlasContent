## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hawthorn thrives in temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade and moderate, consistent moisture. It is adaptable but benefits from well-drained soil and minimal fertilization. Pruning for shape and health is recommended annually.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, typically an annual application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer if soil is poor.
