## 🧤 Care Instructions
This montane meadow native thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring consistently moist but well-drained soil. Provide light to moderate fertilization during its active growth to support its delicate blooms, avoiding waterlogged conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season, as montane soils are typically not overly rich.
