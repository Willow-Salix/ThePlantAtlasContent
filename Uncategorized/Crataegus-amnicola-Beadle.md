| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, adapting to open areas or dappled light along watercourses. |

## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
This hawthorn thrives in moist, well-drained soil under full sun to partial shade, reflecting its native riverbank habitat in the southeastern U.S. Provide consistent moisture, especially in dry periods, and fertilize sparingly only if necessary to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Generally not a heavy feeder. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring if soil is poor or growth is lacking.
