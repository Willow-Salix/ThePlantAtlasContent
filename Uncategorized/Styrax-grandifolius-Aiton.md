## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to partial shade, tolerating full sun in cooler climates or with consistent moisture. Protect from intense afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, but well-draining, soil as it's native to moist woods and streambanks. Water regularly, especially during dry periods and establishment. |

## Introduction
Styrax (common names storax or snowbell) is a genus of about 130 species of large shrubs or small trees in the family Styracaceae, mostly native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with the majority in eastern and southeastern Asia, but also crossing the equator in South America. The resin obtained from the tree is called benzoin or storax (not to be confused with the Liquidambar storax balsam), often used as a vanilla-like component in perfumery.
The genus Pamphilia, sometimes regarded as distinct, is now included within Styrax based on analysis of morphological and DNA sequence data. The spicebush (Lindera benzoin) is a different plant, in the family Lauraceae.
Styrax trees grow to 2–14 m tall, and have alternate, deciduous or evergreen simple ovate leaves 1–18 cm long and 2–10 cm broad. The flowers are pendulous, with a white 5–10-lobed corolla, produced 3–30 together on open or dense panicles 5–25 cm long. The fruit is an oblong dry drupe, smooth and lacking ribs or narrow wings, unlike the fruit of the related snowdrop trees (Halesia) and epaulette trees (Pterostyrax).

## Care Guide
Thriving in the temperate, moist woodland environment of the southeastern U.S., the Bigleaf Snowbell requires partial sun to partial shade and consistently moist, rich, well-draining, slightly acidic soil. Provide regular watering, particularly during dry periods, and an annual balanced fertilization for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Prefers rich, organically-amended, slightly acidic soil. Benefits from an annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, particularly if native soil is nutrient-poor.
