## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lindenberg's Asterella thrives in conditions replicating its native cool temperate forest understory, demanding low to moderate indirect light and exceptionally high humidity. Maintain a consistently moist substrate without waterlogging, and use fertilizers very sparingly due to its sensitivity.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; liverworts are highly sensitive to fertilizers. If absolutely necessary, apply a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly once or twice a year.
