## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (including Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado) and northern Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Montane Scrubland and Woodlands. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun exposure, indicative of its natural open habitats. Can tolerate some partial shade, especially in the hottest parts of its range. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering should be avoided. |

## Introduction
Pseudognaphalium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as cudweeds or rabbit tobacco (P. obtusifolium is the original species with that name). They are widespread in tropical and temperate regions of many countries.
Species have been moved between Pseudognaphalium and the related genus Gnaphalium.

## Care Guide
Arizona Cudweed is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and dry conditions, replicating its arid montane origins. It is highly drought-tolerant and should be watered infrequently, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry out between waterings. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as it is adapted to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Requires minimal to no fertilizer. Its native soils are often lean. If growth appears stunted in very poor soil, a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
