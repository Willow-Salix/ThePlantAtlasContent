## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate and Boreal regions of North America (e.g., Eastern U.S., Pacific Northwest) and Europe |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate and Boreal Forests, Woodlands, and Peatlands |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Sun to Partial Shade. Thrives in areas with good ambient light but protected from intense, direct sunlight, especially during dry periods. |
| **Watering** | Requires frequent moisture from rainfall, dew, or high atmospheric humidity. It can tolerate dry periods but needs regular rehydration to remain active and healthy. |

## Introduction
Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations.
Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).
Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.
Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dunes, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.
Larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes continuella, feed on Cladonia species.

## Care Guide
To care for Cylinder Cup Lichen, provide a consistently humid environment with regular moisture and partial sun to partial shade. Ensure good air circulation and avoid any fertilization, as lichens are sensitive to nutrient pollution and obtain nutrients naturally.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens are sensitive to nutrient enrichment and typically obtain all necessary nutrients from the air and the substrate they grow on.
