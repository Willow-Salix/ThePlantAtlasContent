## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia (New South Wales and Queensland) |
| **Climate** | Warm Temperate Woodlands and Sclerophyll Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure to thrive, typical of open woodland species. Can tolerate light partial shade but may result in less vigorous growth. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to often dry conditions in its native habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings; avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Acacia binervata, commonly known as two-veined hickory, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to eastern Australia. It is a bushy shrub or tree, with narrowly egg-shaped to narrowly elliptic phyllodes, creamy yellow flowers arranged in spherical heads in 15 to 25 racemes, and glabrous, thinly crust-like to leathery pods up to 140 mm (5.5 in) long.

## Care Guide
Provide this Australian native with full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its open woodland habitat. Water infrequently once established, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between applications, and avoid high phosphorus fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, especially avoiding high phosphorus formulations, as Australian native plants are often adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can be sensitive. If needed, use a specialized native plant fertilizer once a year in spring.
