## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically from California north to British Columbia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Meadow/Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and flowering, reflecting its open meadow habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; requires consistent moisture, especially during establishment, but tolerates drier conditions once mature. Allow soil to dry slightly between waterings, mimicking natural rainfall patterns in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Achillea  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The plants typically have frilly leaves and are known colloquially as yarrows, although this common name usually refers to A. millefolium. The genus was named after the Greek mythological character Achilles, whose soldiers were said to have used yarrow to treat their wounds; this is reflected by common names such as allheal and bloodwort. The genus is native primarily to Eurasia and North America.

## Care Guide
Giant Yarrow prefers full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native temperate meadow habitat. It requires moderate, consistent watering, becoming drought-tolerant once established. Avoid excessive fertilization, as it thrives in lean to average soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; prefers lean to average soil. Over-fertilization can lead to weak, leggy growth rather than robust flowering, consistent with plants adapted to less nutrient-rich meadow soils.
