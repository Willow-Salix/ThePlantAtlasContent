## Care Guide
Rabbitsfoot grass thrives in consistently moist to wet soil and prefers full sun. It requires frequent watering to prevent drying out and can benefit from moderate fertilization, especially in nutrient-poor soils. This adaptable grass is relatively low-maintenance once its high moisture needs are met.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season, particularly if the native soil is observed to be poor in nutrients.
