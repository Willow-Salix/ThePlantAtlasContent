## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia, Pacific Islands (e.g., Hawaii, Fiji, New Guinea), and parts of Queensland, Australia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Subtropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect bright light to partial shade. Avoid direct, harsh sunlight, especially during midday, as it can scorch leaves. Mimics understory or dappled light conditions. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil begins to dry. Requires high humidity, so regular misting or a humidifier is beneficial. |

## Care Guide
Freycinetia thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest habitat, requiring consistently moist soil and high humidity. Provide indirect bright light or partial shade, and fertilize sparingly during active growth to support its climbing nature.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize lightly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
