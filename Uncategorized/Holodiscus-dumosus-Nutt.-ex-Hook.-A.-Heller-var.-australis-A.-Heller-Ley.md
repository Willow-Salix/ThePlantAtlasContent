## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah) and Baja California |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Montane Shrubland/Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers full sun for optimal flowering in most regions, can tolerate afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during the dry season. |

## Introduction
Holodiscus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae, native to the Americas, from southwestern British Columbia, Canada and the western United States south to Bolivia.
The species are deciduous shrubs, growing to 1–7 metres (3.3–23.0 ft) tall.

## Care Guide
This resilient shrub thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native semi-arid montane habitat. Water sparingly once established, allowing for dry periods between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization to prevent leggy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low; native to lean, rocky soils. Requires minimal to no fertilization; a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring if growth is poor.
