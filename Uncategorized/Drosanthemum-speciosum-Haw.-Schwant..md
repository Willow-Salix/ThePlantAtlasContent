## Introduction
Drosanthemum (the dewflowers) is a genus of succulent plants in the ice plant family native to the winter-rainfall regions of southern Africa, including Namibia and the Cape Provinces and Free State of South Africa. Most species bear colorful flowers.
The name Drosanthemum means "dew-flower" in Greek, and refers to the characteristic shiny translucent papillae, which cover the succulent leaves and flower buds.

## Care Guide
The Royal Dewflower thrives in bright, direct sunlight, mimicking its native arid scrubland habitat. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to completely dry out between applications to prevent rot. Provide well-draining soil and minimal fertilization for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; a diluted, balanced succulent fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the active growing season.
