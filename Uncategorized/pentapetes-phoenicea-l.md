## 🌱 Overview
Pentapetes is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It contains a single species, Pentapetes phoenicea. The plant is commonly known as noon flower, midday flower or scarlet mallow and occasionally cultivated. This is so named as the flowers open around noon, and closes around next day early morning.
The plant grows around 4–6 ft in height and the branches are long and spreading. Leaves are 6–10 cm in length, toothed at the margins, usually having a broad base and tapering to a pointed tip. Flowers are born in the axils of the leaves with 5 large deep red colored petals.  The fruit is a 5-valved, rounded, hairy capsule, about 1 centimetre in diameter. The seeds, which are not winged, occur 8–12 in two series in each cell.
The flower is native to a wide region of tropical Asia, from India and Sri Lanka through Indochina to southern China, Peninsular Malaysia, the Philippines, and New Guinea.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Midday Flower, native to tropical moist forests, thrives in bright conditions and consistently moist soil. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure frequent watering to keep the soil moist, coupled with moderate fertilization during its active growth period for optimal health and flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from regular feeding during the active growing season (spring through fall) with a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer, due to the rapid nutrient cycling in its native climate.
