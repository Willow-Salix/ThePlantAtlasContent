| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun, meaning at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day, thriving in intense light conditions typical of desert environments. |

## Introduction
Koeberlinia spinosa is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico known by several common names, including crown of thorns, allthorn, smokebush, and crucifixion thorn. It is one of two species of the genus Koeberlinia, which is sometimes considered to be the only genus in the plant family Koeberliniaceae. Alternately it is treated as a member of the caper family. This is a shrub of moderate to large size, sprawling to maximum heights over 4 m (13 ft). It is entirely green while growing and is made up of tangling straight stems which branch many times. The tip of each rigid stem branch tapers into a long, sharp spine. Leaves are mainly rudimentary, taking the form of tiny deciduous scales. Most of the photosynthesis occurs in the green stem branches. The shrub blooms abundantly in white to greenish-white flowers. The fruits are shiny black berries each a few millimeters long; they are attractive to birds.
Koeberlinia spinosa can be found in northern regions of the Mexican Plateau and in the east down into the northern foothills of the Sierra Madre Orientals. In the west it ranges into the southern, and central Sonoran Desert of Sonora, and southern and southwestern Arizona; it also ranges into three areas of Baja California Sur-(part of the Sonoran Desert).

## Care Guide
This extremely drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, poor soils, requiring very infrequent watering. Once established, it is remarkably low-maintenance, needing little to no supplemental water or fertilizer. Its robust nature makes it ideal for xeriscaping in arid regions.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient requirements. Thrives in poor, rocky, well-draining soils and generally does not require fertilization.
