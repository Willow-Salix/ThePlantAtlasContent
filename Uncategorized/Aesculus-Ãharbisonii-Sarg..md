| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hybrid origin; parents native to Eastern and Southeastern United States |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade. Can tolerate full sun but benefits from some afternoon shade in hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture, especially during dry periods and while establishing. Avoid waterlogged conditions; good drainage is essential. |

## Introduction
The genus Aesculus ( or ), with notable species including buckeye and horse chestnut, comprises 13–19 species of flowering plants in the family Sapindaceae. They are trees and shrubs native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with six species native to North America and seven to 13 species native to Eurasia. Several hybrids occur. Aesculus exhibits a classical Arcto-Tertiary distribution. 
Mexican buckeye seedpods resemble the Aesculus seedpods, but belong to a different genus.
Carl Linnaeus named the genus Aesculus after the Roman name for an edible acorn. Common names for these trees include "buckeye" and "horse chestnut", though they are not in the same order as the true chestnuts, Castanea in the Fagales. Some are also called white chestnut or red chestnut. In Britain, they are sometimes called conker trees because of their link to the game of conkers, played with the seeds, which are also called conkers.

## Care Guide
Harbison's Buckeye is a cultivated hybrid thriving in conditions similar to its parent species from the temperate deciduous forests of the Eastern US. It requires full sun to partial shade, consistent moisture with good drainage, and moderately rich soil. Provide regular watering and amend soil with organic matter for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in moderately rich, well-draining soil. Amending with compost or organic matter is beneficial. A balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil is poor.
