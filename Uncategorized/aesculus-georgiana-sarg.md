## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Georgia, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight daily, tolerating more sun in cooler climates or with adequate moisture. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate and consistent watering, especially during dry periods and its establishment phase. Ensure well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging, mimicking the regular rainfall of its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
The genus Aesculus ( or ), with notable species including buckeye and horse chestnut, comprises 13–19 species of flowering plants in the family Sapindaceae. They are trees and shrubs native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with six species native to North America and seven to 13 species native to Eurasia. Several hybrids occur. Aesculus exhibits a classical Arcto-Tertiary distribution. 
Mexican buckeye seedpods resemble the Aesculus seedpods, but belong to a different genus.
Carl Linnaeus named the genus Aesculus after the Roman name for an edible acorn. Common names for these trees include "buckeye" and "horse chestnut", though they are not in the same order as the true chestnuts, Castanea in the Fagales. Some are also called white chestnut or red chestnut. In Britain, they are sometimes called conker trees because of their link to the game of conkers, played with the seeds, which are also called conkers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Dwarf Buckeye thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistent, moderate moisture in well-drained soil. It generally requires low to moderate fertilization, benefiting from an annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer. This adaptable plant prefers conditions mimicking its native temperate forest environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or compost application in early spring can be beneficial, particularly in poor soils. Generally does not require heavy fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient cycling in forest environments.
