Erysimum, or wallflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the cabbage family, Brassicaceae. It includes more than 150 species, both popular garden plants and many wild forms. Erysimum is characterised by star-shaped (and/or two-sided) trichomes growing from the stem, with yellow, red, pink or orange flowers and multiseeded seed pods.

## Care Guide
Menzies' Wallflower thrives in full sun and very well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its native coastal dune habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent any waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
