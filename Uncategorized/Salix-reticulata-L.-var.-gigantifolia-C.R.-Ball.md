## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Subarctic regions, including Northern North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada), Greenland, Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Russia), and Northern Asia; also alpine zones in temperate mountains. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, bright conditions with direct exposure, typical of its treeless native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil. Its native environment often features perpetually damp, well-drained but not dry conditions, sometimes near bogs or melting snow. Does not tolerate drought. |

## Introduction
Salix reticulata, the net-leaved willow, or snow willow, is a dwarf willow, native to the colder parts of Europe, North America, and Northern Asia. It is found in the western United States (Salix reticulata subsp. nivalis), including the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains. In Europe it extends south through the Carpathian Mountains and Alps to the Pyrenees and the mountains of Bulgaria and North Macedonia. It is common in Canada, Greenland and Finland, and present but rare in Scotland.
The plant grows on wet, often slightly calcareous, rocks and ledges.

## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine willow requires cool temperatures, full to partial sun, and consistently moist, well-drained soil to mimic its tundra origins. Avoid drought and overly rich soils, as it thrives in lean conditions with minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Native tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor; rich fertilization can be detrimental. A very light, balanced feed in early spring, if at all.
