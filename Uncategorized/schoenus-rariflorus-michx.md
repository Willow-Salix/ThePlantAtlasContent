## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet, acidic soil, mimicking its native boggy savanna habitat. Fertilization should be light, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. Ensure continuous moisture to prevent desiccation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy, and acidic soils. A slow-release or diluted liquid fertilizer suitable for acid-loving plants can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
