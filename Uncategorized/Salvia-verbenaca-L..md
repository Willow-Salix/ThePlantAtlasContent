| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin (including Southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of Western Asia) and temperate regions of Europe. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Woodland and Temperate Grassland (characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters). |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun, mirroring its native open grassland and sunny Mediterranean habitats. Can tolerate light partial shade. |
| **Watering** | Requires infrequent watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry summer periods. |

## Introduction
Salvia verbenaca, also known as wild clary or wild sage, is native to the British Isles, the Mediterranean region in Southern Europe, North Africa, and Near East, and in the Caucasus. It can be found as an introduced species that has naturalized in many parts of the world, including the Eastern United States, California, Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay, Southern Africa, Tasmania, New Zealand and China.
S. verbenaca is a tall perennial herb with hairy stems and branches that erectly sprawl out. Its leaves are basal and toothed that vary from 3 to 10 cm (1.2 to 3.9 in) long. It has soft purple to violet flowers in mid summer. It is in flower from June to September, and the seeds ripen from July to October. The flowers are bisexual and are pollinated by bees. Some are also cleistogamous and pollinate themselves.
The plant is noted for attracting pollinators and wildlife. It prefers neutral and alkaline soils and needs full sun. This aromatic sage is used as a flavoring in foods and to make tea; the flowers can be added to salads.
In China, where it has been known by the synonym Salvia weihaiensis, it grows along the seashore in Shandong province.

## Care Guide
Wild Clary is a hardy plant that thrives in sunny, well-drained locations, typical of its native Mediterranean and temperate grassland habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, preferring lean to moderately fertile soils. Overwatering and excessive fertilization should be avoided to ensure robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils, common in its native disturbed sites and rocky slopes. Avoid over-fertilization.
