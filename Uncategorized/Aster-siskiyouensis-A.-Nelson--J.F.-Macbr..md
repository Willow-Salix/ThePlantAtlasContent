## Care Guide
Siskiyou Aster thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. Water moderately during active growth, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, as it tolerates dry spells once established. Minimal fertilization is typically sufficient for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
