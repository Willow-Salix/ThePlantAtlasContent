## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Millettia 'oiltree', native to tropical and subtropical Asia, thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistent watering during its active growth phase, tapering off during drier periods. Being a nitrogen-fixing plant, it benefits from moderate, balanced fertilization, with less emphasis on nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose formula during the growing season. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally does not require heavy nitrogen supplementation.
