## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, Western Asia (e.g., Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Iran) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Forest (Temperate) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is ideal, especially in cooler climates. In hotter regions, partial shade during the hottest part of the day can prevent bolting. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial. Water regularly to keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged, especially during dry spells, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is an annual plant of the family Asteraceae mostly grown as a leaf vegetable. The leaves are most often used raw in green salads, although lettuce is also seen in other kinds of food, such as sandwiches, wraps and soups; it can also be grilled. Its stem and seeds are sometimes used; celtuce (asparagus lettuce) is one variety grown for its stems, which are eaten either raw or cooked. In addition to its main use as a leafy green, it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of human consumption. Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world. In 2023, world production of lettuce (and chicory) was 28 million tonnes, led by  China with 53% of the total.
Lettuce was originally farmed by the ancient Egyptians, who transformed it from a plant whose seeds were used to obtain oil into an important food crop raised for its succulent leaves and oil-rich seeds. Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans; the latter gave it the name lactuca, from which the English lettuce is derived. By 50 AD, many types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval writings, including several herbals. The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many varieties in Europe, and by the mid-18th century, cultivars were described that can still be found in modern gardens.
Generally grown as a hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, although it requires relatively low temperatures to prevent it from flowering quickly. It can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, as well as insect and mammal pests, and fungal and bacterial diseases. L. sativa crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the genus Lactuca. Although this trait can be a problem to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.
Contaminated lettuce is often a source of bacterial, viral, and parasitic outbreaks in humans, including E. coli and Salmonella.

## Care Guide
Lettuce thrives in cool, mild conditions with ample sunlight and consistently moist soil. Ensure regular watering and provide moderate nutrients to support lush, tender leaf production. Protect from intense heat to prevent premature bolting and bitterness.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. Best grown in nutrient-rich, well-draining soil. Incorporate organic matter (compost) before planting, and a balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied every 2-4 weeks during active growth.
