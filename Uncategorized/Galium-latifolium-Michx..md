## Introduction
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## Care Guide
Purple Bedstraw thrives in cool, shaded conditions with consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its native Appalachian forest understory. Protect it from intense direct sunlight and ensure regular watering to prevent drying out. Moderate feeding with organic matter will support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from an annual application of organic compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer, especially if soil is poor.
