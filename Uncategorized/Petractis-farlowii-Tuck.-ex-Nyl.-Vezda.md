## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, including the Appalachian Mountains, Great Lakes region, and New England |
| **Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests, specifically cool, humid, deeply shaded microhabitats on non-calcareous rocks, often near streams or in ravines |
| **Sunlight** | Extremely low light; thrives in deep shade or very diffused, indirect light, mimicking a dense forest understory. Direct sunlight is detrimental. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and regular moisture; misting may be necessary in drier conditions. The substrate should remain damp but not waterlogged. |

## Introduction
Petractis is a small genus of lichen-forming fungi of uncertain familial and ordinal placement in the Lecanoromycetes. These inconspicuous lichens grow as thin crusts embedded within rock surfaces, partnering with cyanobacteria to form barely visible films that are primarily detected by their small, star-shaped fruiting bodies. The genus contains two species that typically inhabit calcareous rocks, where their fruiting structures create distinctive pits in the stone surface after they decay.

## Care Guide
Farlow's Petractis demands a consistently cool, highly humid, and deeply shaded environment, replicating its natural conditions on non-calcareous rocks within temperate forests. Critical care involves maintaining high ambient moisture and protecting it from any direct sunlight or artificial fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no external fertilization needed. Lichens obtain nutrients from atmospheric dust and rainwater; commercial fertilizers are typically harmful.
