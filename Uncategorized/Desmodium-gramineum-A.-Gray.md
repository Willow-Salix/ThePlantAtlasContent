| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Semi-arid Grasslands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, tolerating intense sun common in its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. More frequent watering may be needed during prolonged dry spells or extreme heat, but avoid overwatering. |

## Introduction
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. Species are distributed widely – from Quebec to northern Argentina in the Americas, across northern and southern tropical Africa, in the southern Arabian Peninsula, in Myanmar and Thailand, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its arid and semi-arid native regions. Water sparingly once established, and provide minimal fertilization, leveraging its natural ability to fix nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so heavy nitrogen fertilization is unnecessary. A light application of a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer or compost in spring is sufficient, especially in poor soils.
