## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in highly humid, shaded environments mimicking its native tropical rainforest habitat. Ensure consistent moisture and high ambient humidity, while avoiding direct sun or dry conditions. Fertilization is generally not required as nutrients are absorbed from the environment.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; lichens absorb nutrients directly from the air and rain, not requiring traditional soil fertilization.
