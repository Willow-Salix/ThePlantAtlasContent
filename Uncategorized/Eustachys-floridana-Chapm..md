## Care Guide
This adaptable warm-season grass prefers full sun and a humid subtropical environment. Provide moderate watering, allowing for some drying between sessions, and offer light fertilization during its main growing period for best results.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring through summer), especially if soil is poor or sandy, reflecting its prevalence in disturbed or less fertile areas.
