## Care Guide
The Navajo Evening Primrose thrives in full sun and extremely well-draining, lean soils, mimicking its arid native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, making it a low-maintenance plant. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in lean to poor soils typical of arid regions. Minimal or no fertilization is generally required.
