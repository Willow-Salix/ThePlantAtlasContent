## 🌱 Overview
Loranthus is a genus of parasitic plants that grow on the branches of woody trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae, the showy mistletoe family. In most earlier systematic treatments it contains all mistletoe species with bisexual flowers, though some species have reversed to unisexual flowers. Other treatments restrict the genus to a few species. The systematic situation of Loranthus is not entirely clear.
The generic name in botanical Latin means strap-flower, in reference to the shape of the petals.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a parasitic plant, Loranthus piperoides Kunth cannot be cultivated independently and requires a suitable living host. Its care is intrinsically linked to the health of its host and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light, mimicking its native tropical rainforest conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No direct fertilizer application is needed for the mistletoe itself, as it obtains all necessary nutrients from its host plant.
