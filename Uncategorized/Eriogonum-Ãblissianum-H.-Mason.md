## Introduction
Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) or common buckwheat is a flowering plant in the knotweed family Polygonaceae cultivated for its grain-like seeds and as a cover crop. Buckwheat cultivation originated around the 6th millennium BC in the region of what is now Yunnan Province in southwestern China. The name "buckwheat" is used for several other species, such as Fagopyrum tataricum, a domesticated food plant raised in Asia.
Despite its name, buckwheat is not closely related to wheat, nor is it a cereal or a member of the grass family. It is related to sorrel, knotweed, and rhubarb. Buckwheat is considered a pseudocereal because the high starch content of the seeds enables buckwheat to be cooked and consumed like a cereal.

## Care Guide
This California native hybrid thrives in conditions mimicking its Mediterranean Arid Scrubland origin, requiring full sun and excellent drainage. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering and minimal fertilizer to flourish. Avoid overwatering, especially in summer.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to moderately fertile soil and generally does not require supplemental fertilization.
