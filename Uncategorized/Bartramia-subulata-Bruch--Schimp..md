## Care Guide
This moss thrives in environments mimicking its native temperate forest understory, requiring low to partial light and consistently high humidity. Maintain a damp substrate with frequent watering or misting, and avoid direct sunlight. Fertilization is generally not needed.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. Mosses derive most nutrients from water and air; excessive fertilizer can be detrimental to their growth.
