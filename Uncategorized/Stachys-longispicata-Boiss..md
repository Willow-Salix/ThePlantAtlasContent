## Care Guide
To mimic its native Mediterranean conditions, provide full sun and well-draining soil. This plant is drought-tolerant, so water sparingly once established and avoid over-fertilization. It is an excellent choice for xeriscaping or sunny, dry garden spots.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in relatively lean soils. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial, but often not necessary.
