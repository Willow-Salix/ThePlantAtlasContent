## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Molokai, Hawaii, USA |
| **Climate** | Tropical Mesic Forest and Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun (4-6 hours), avoiding harsh, intense midday sun. Mimics the light conditions found on rocky slopes and cliff faces within its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Requires excellent drainage, characteristic of its rocky native environment, to prevent waterlogging and root rot. High humidity is also beneficial. |

## Introduction
Schiedea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It contains 35 species which are endemic to Hawaii.
The 35th species was spotted in 2016 by Tom DeMent while surveying a forest near Laupāhoehoe on Hawai‘i Island. It was named S. haakoaensis in 2022.

## Care Guide
This critically endangered Hawaiian endemic thrives in conditions mimicking its native Molokai mesic cliff habitats: bright indirect to partial sun, consistent moisture with excellent drainage, and high humidity. Provide light fertilization during warmer months to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release or diluted liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Avoid over-fertilization, as native Hawaiian soils are not typically overly rich.
