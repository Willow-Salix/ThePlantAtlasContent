| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (Eastern United States and Southeastern Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (Wetlands/Swamp) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers partial shade in warmer climates or less consistently moist conditions, and tolerates full sun when soil moisture is abundant. |
| **Watering** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native boggy or swampy habitats. It is intolerant of drought and can even tolerate temporary standing water. |

## Introduction
Viburnum is a genus of about 150–175 species of flowering plants in the moschatel family, Adoxaceae or its alternative name Viburnaceae. Its current classification is based on molecular phylogeny. It was previously included in the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae.
The member species are evergreen or deciduous shrubs or (in a few cases) small trees native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species extending into tropical montane regions in South America and southeast Asia. In Africa, the genus is confined to the Atlas Mountains.

## Care Guide
Withe-rod is a moisture-loving shrub originating from eastern North American wetlands, demanding consistently wet soil conditions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade, with ample moisture being more critical than light intensity. Provide moderate fertility, preferably through organic matter, to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; thrives in rich, organic soils but is not a heavy feeder. An annual application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is generally sufficient.
