## Care Guide
Western Goldenrod thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, replicating its natural habitat along streambanks and in wet meadows. It requires full to partial sun exposure for robust growth and flowering, and is relatively undemanding regarding soil fertility, adapting well to average conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally adaptable to average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization. An annual application of compost or a light balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth is poor.
