## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spiked Oatgrass is a resilient alpine plant that prefers full sun and well-drained, lean soils. It requires moderate watering, tolerating drought once established, and has very low nutrient demands, reflecting its adaptation to harsh, exposed environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils characteristic of its native alpine and arctic environments. Supplemental fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
