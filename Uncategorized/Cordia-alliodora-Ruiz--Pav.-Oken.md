## Introduction
Cordia is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. It contains 228 species of shrubs and trees, that are found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Many of the species are commonly called manjack, while bocote may refer to several Central American species in Spanish.
The generic name honours German botanist and pharmacist Valerius Cordus (1515–1544). Like most other Boraginaceae, the majority have trichomes (hairs) on the leaves.

## Care Guide
To cultivate Spanish Elm, provide plenty of direct sunlight and ensure consistent, ample watering throughout its growing season, allowing for brief drying periods. A balanced fertilizer applied moderately will support its rapid development. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate feeding with a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer during its active growth period (spring and summer) to support its fast growth rate.
