## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Semi-Arid Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential to mimic its open native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water deeply but infrequently, especially during its active growing season, and reduce significantly in cooler months. |

## Introduction
Polygala is a large genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygalaceae. They are commonly known as milkworts or snakeroots. The genus is distributed widely throughout much of the world in temperate zones and the tropics. The genus name Polygala comes from the ancient Greek "much milk", as the plant was thought to increase milk yields in cattle.

## Care Guide
This variety of White Milkwort thrives in conditions mirroring its native arid scrubland environment. Provide abundant full sun and ensure excellent soil drainage to prevent root rot. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization to promote its natural robust, drought-adapted growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; native soils are typically lean. A diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the growing season, or none at all if soil nutrients are adequate.
