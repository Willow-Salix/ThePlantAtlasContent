## Care Guide
This hardy plant thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions mimicking its native montane grasslands. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. Avoid heavy fertilization, especially nitrogen, as it's adapted to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; rarely needs fertilization. If necessary, a light application of a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer in spring.
