## Care Guide
This mountain-dwelling plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native temperate montane regions in Western Europe. It requires moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry between waterings, and benefits from minimal fertilization.

Low to moderate fertilization. Thrives in lean, well-draining soils and does not require rich feeding. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring.
