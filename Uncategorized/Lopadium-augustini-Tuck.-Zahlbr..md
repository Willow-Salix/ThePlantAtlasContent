# Augustin Granular Lichen

*Lopadium augustini (Tuck.) Zahlbr.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States, Caribbean |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to partial shade. As an epiphyte often found on tree bark, it is accustomed to filtered light under a canopy and should be protected from direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is paramount. Requires consistent moisture from ambient air and frequent rainfall. Regular misting or placement in a terrarium/humid environment is beneficial to prevent desiccation. Avoid prolonged dryness. |

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in highly humid environments with indirect light, mimicking its native subtropical forest habitat. It requires consistent moisture through high ambient humidity and regular exposure to water, while having minimal nutrient needs, making fertilizers generally unnecessary and potentially harmful.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Lichens absorb nutrients directly from the air, rainfall, and the substrate they grow on. Excess nutrients, especially from synthetic fertilizers, can be detrimental.
