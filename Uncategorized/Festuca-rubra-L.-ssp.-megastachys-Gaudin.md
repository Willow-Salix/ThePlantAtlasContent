## Introduction
Festuca rubra is a species of grass known by the common name red fescue, creeping red fescue or the rush-leaf fescue. It is widespread across much of the Northern Hemisphere and can tolerate many habitats and climates. It is best adapted to well-drained soils in cool, temperate climates; it prefers shadier areas and is often planted for its shade tolerance. Wild animals browse it, but it has not been important for domestic forage due to low productivity and palatability. It is also an ornamental plant for gardens.

## Care Guide
This fescue thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a range of soil types, including poorer ones. It prefers consistent moisture but is quite drought-tolerant once established. Minimal fertilization is needed to mimic its native temperate montane conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor soils; minimal fertilization is typically required, perhaps a light feeding in spring for optimal growth.
