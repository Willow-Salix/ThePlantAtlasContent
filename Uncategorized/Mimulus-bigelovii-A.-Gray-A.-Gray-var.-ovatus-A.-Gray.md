## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah) and parts of Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) to partial sun, especially in the hottest desert regions where some afternoon shade can be beneficial. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; water deeply when the topsoil is completely dry, then allow it to dry out again before the next watering. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to periods of aridity, thriving with seasonal rains. |

## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
Bigelow's Monkeyflower thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its arid native habitat. Water deeply but infrequently during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Fertilization is typically unnecessary, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally does not require fertilization. If grown in extremely poor soil, a very light, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied once during its active growth phase.
