## Introduction
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## Care Guide
This hardy perennial thrives in temperate climates, preferring full to partial sun exposure and well-drained, average to poor soils. It requires moderate watering, tolerating dry spells, and benefits from minimal fertilization to mimic its natural habitat conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. It is adapted to nutrient-poor to average soils, such as sandy or rocky areas. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
