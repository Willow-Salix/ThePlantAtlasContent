## Care Guide
To care for Pyrenidium Lichen, maintain a consistently high humidity environment with low to medium indirect light, mimicking its rainforest origins. Frequent misting is crucial for its moisture absorption, and absolutely no fertilizers should be applied due to its sensitivity.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens are highly self-sufficient and sensitive to pollutants and chemical additives; artificial fertilizers can be harmful.
