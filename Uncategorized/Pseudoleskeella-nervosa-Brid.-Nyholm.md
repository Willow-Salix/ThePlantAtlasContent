## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia, often found in montane and boreal forest environments. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forests, characterized by cool temperatures, high humidity, and regular precipitation. |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. It thrives in shaded or partially shaded conditions, typical of a forest understory, and should be protected from harsh direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial. The substrate should be kept evenly moist but not waterlogged. High humidity is highly beneficial, possibly achieved through regular misting or placement in a humid environment. |

## Care Guide
This moss requires a consistently moist and humid environment with low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its natural forest habitat. Ensure consistent moisture without waterlogging and avoid direct sun. Fertilization is generally not necessary.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. Mosses have minimal nutrient demands and can be harmed by excessive fertilization. If absolutely necessary, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied very sparingly.
