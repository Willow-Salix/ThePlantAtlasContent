## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and demands consistently moist soil, reflecting its native habitat in temperate wet meadows. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry periods, and provide moderate nutrients for healthy growth. It prefers fertile, organic-rich soil but can adapt to average conditions if moisture is maintained.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate nutrient needs. Thrives in fertile, well-draining soil rich in organic matter, but can tolerate average to poor soils if moisture is consistent.
