## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (primarily Pacific Northwest), parts of Europe |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coniferous Forest / Maritime Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Filtered light to partial shade, protected from intense direct sun, mimicking its growth on conifer bark within a forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and frequent moisture from rain or fog; should never be allowed to dry out completely but needs good air circulation. |

## Introduction
Schismatomma is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Roccellaceae. These lichens form thin crusts on bark or rock surfaces and reproduce through disc-shaped fruiting bodies that release spores, as well as through powdery patches that help them spread. At least one species is critically endangered due to habitat loss from deforestation in Colombia.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in high humidity and filtered light, mirroring its native temperate coniferous forest habitat. Ensure a consistently moist atmosphere and stable substrate, avoiding direct sun and any form of fertilization.

### Fertilizer
As a lichen, it obtains sufficient nutrients from the air and substrate; no conventional fertilization is required or recommended.
