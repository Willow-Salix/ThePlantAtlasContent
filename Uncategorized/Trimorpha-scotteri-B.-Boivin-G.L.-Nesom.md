| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra to Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun to partial sun, adapted to the high light exposure found above or near the treeline in its native habitat. |

## Care Guide
Scotter's Fleabane thrives in conditions mirroring its native alpine habitat, necessitating full sun and consistently moist, exceptionally well-drained soil. It is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and requires minimal, if any, fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky or gravelly soils characteristic of alpine environments; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
