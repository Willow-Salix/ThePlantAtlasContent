## Introduction
Rubus is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, subfamily Rosoideae, most commonly known as brambles. Fruits of various species are known as raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, and bristleberries. It is a diverse genus, with the estimated number of Rubus species varying from 250 to over 1000, found across all continents except Antarctica.
Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles like roses; spines, bristles, and gland-tipped hairs are also common in the genus. The Rubus fruit, sometimes called a bramble fruit, is an aggregate of drupelets. The term cane fruit or cane berry applies to any Rubus species or hybrid which is commonly grown with supports such as wires or canes, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry. The stems of such plants are also referred to as canes.

## Care Guide
The Woolly Blackberry thrives in full sun to partial shade, mimicking its native Mediterranean environment with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It requires moderate watering, becoming drought-tolerant once established, and prefers average soil fertility without the need for heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant grows in naturally occurring soils that are not overly rich. A balanced, general-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly if soil nutrients are poor.
