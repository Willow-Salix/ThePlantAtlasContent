## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (specifically Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires high light exposure characteristic of treeless alpine environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent moisture during its short growing season, but absolutely requires extremely well-draining, gritty soil to mimic its rocky native habitat and prevent root rot. Tolerates brief dry spells. |

## Introduction
Draba is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, commonly known as whitlow-grasses (though they are not related to the true grasses).

## Care Guide
To cultivate Snowbasin Draba, replicate its native alpine environment by providing full sun and exceptionally well-draining, rocky, or gritty soil. Water moderately during the active growing season, ensuring the soil never becomes waterlogged, and avoid heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; alpine soils are typically nutrient-poor, and rich soil can be detrimental to its health.
