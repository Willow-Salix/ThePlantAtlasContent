## Introduction
Eriogonum fasciculatum is a species of wild buckwheat known by the common names California buckwheat and flat-topped buckwheat. Characterized by small, white and pink flower clusters that give off a cottony effect, this species grows variably from a patchy mat to a wide shrub, with the flowers turning a rusty color after blooming. This plant is of great benefit across its various habitats, providing an important food resource for a diversity of insect and mammal species. It also provides numerous ecosystem services for humans, including erosion control, post-fire mitigation, increases in crop yields when planted in hedgerows, and high habitat restoration value.

## Care Guide
California Buckwheat thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, making it drought-tolerant. It does not typically need fertilization and prefers well-drained soil. Overwatering and over-fertilizing should be avoided.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; typically does not require fertilization. Avoid over-fertilizing, as this can reduce flowering.
