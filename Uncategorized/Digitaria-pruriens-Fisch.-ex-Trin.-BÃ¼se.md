## Introduction
Digitaria is a genus of plants in the grass family native to tropical and warm temperate regions but can occur in tropical, subtropical, and cooler temperate regions as well. Common names include crabgrass, finger-grass, and fonio. They are slender monocotyledonous annual and perennial lawn, pasture, and forage plants; some are often considered lawn pests. Digitus is the Latin word for "finger", and they are distinguished by the long, finger-like inflorescences they produce.

## Care Guide
This tropical and subtropical crabgrass thrives in full sun with moderate, consistent moisture, reflecting its adaptability to open, disturbed environments. It is not demanding of rich soil fertility, making it a low-maintenance plant in suitable climates.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in average to poor soils and does not require high fertility. Over-fertilization is generally unnecessary.
