Illicium is a genus of flowering plants treated as part of the family Schisandraceae, or alternately as the sole genus of the Illiciaceae. It has a disjunct distribution, with most species native to subtropical and tropical areas of East and Southeast Asia and several in parts of North America, including the southeastern United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean. General common names include star anise and anisetree. The genus name comes from the Latin illicere ("to allure").

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Anisetrees thrive in humid, moist environments, preferring partial to full shade with consistently damp, well-draining soil. Provide moderate fertilization in spring to support their growth and protect them from intense afternoon sun to prevent leaf scorch.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization, particularly with organic matter. A balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost applied annually in spring is generally sufficient.
