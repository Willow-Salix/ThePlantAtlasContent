## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sun daily) is preferred, tolerating light afternoon shade in hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is needed until established, then it becomes highly drought-tolerant. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Baptisia (wild indigo, false indigo) is a genus in the legume family, Fabaceae. They are flowering herbaceous perennial plants with pea-like flowers, followed by pods, which are sometimes inflated. They are native to woodland and grassland in eastern and southern North America. The species most commonly found in cultivation is B. australis.
Baptisia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the jaguar flower moth, Schinia jaguarina.

## Care Guide
Baptisia viridis Larisey thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its native temperate grasslands. Once established, it is remarkably drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it enriches its own soil nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is required. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in average to poor soils; excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth and fewer blooms.
