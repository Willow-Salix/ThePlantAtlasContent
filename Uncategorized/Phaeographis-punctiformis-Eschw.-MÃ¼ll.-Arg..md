## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical Americas, particularly Brazil, extending to other humid regions. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to Medium Indirect Light / Partial Shade. As a corticolous lichen found on tree bark in dense rainforests, it naturally grows under a canopy. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is crucial. Frequent misting or a consistently humid environment (80%+ RH) is required. The substrate (e.g., bark) should be kept consistently moist but not waterlogged. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Phaeographis punctiformis is a tropical lichen that thrives in conditions mimicking its native rainforest habitat. Provide high humidity through frequent misting and ensure consistent moisture for its substrate, avoiding direct sun exposure. No traditional fertilization is necessary as it obtains nutrients atmospherically.

### Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer required. Lichens absorb nutrients primarily from the air, rain, and the substrate they grow on.
