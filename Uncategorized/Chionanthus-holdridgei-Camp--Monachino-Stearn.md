## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Costa Rica, Panama |
| **Climate** | Wet Montane Forest / Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to bright, indirect light, mimicking its natural habitat as an understory or subcanopy tree. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but well-draining. Frequent watering is essential to replicate the high rainfall and humidity of its native cloud forest environment. |

## Introduction
Chionanthus (), common name: fringetrees, is a genus of about 140 species of flowering plants in the family Oleaceae.

The genus has a wide distribution primarily in the tropics and subtropics, but with three species extending north into temperate regions, one (C. retusus) in eastern Asia and two (C. virginicus and C. henryae) in eastern North America. Most of the tropical species are evergreen, while the three temperate species are deciduous. Some botanists restrict Chionanthus to the deciduous, temperate species, treating the evergreen species in a separate genus Linociera, but apart from leaf persistence, there is no other consistent difference between them.
They are shrubs and small to medium-sized trees growing to 3–25 m tall. The leaves are opposite, simple. The flowers are produced in feathery panicles, with a corolla subdivided into four slender lobes; they are white, pale yellow, or tinged pink. The fruit is a drupe containing a single seed.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Chionanthus holdridgei requires conditions similar to its native Central American cloud forests, which means high humidity and consistent moisture. Provide partial shade to bright, indirect light, and ensure the soil remains moist but never waterlogged, with moderate feeding during growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release or liquid fertilizer during the active growing season. Does not require heavy feeding.
