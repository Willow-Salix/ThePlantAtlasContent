## 🧤 Care Instructions
Longleaf Phlox thrives in full sun with well-drained soil, characteristic of its native arid to semi-arid western North American habitats. It requires moderate to infrequent watering once established, preferring dry conditions between waterings, and has very low fertilizer needs. Ensure excellent drainage to maintain plant health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer. This plant is adapted to poor to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilizing can lead to leggy growth. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring is optional but often not necessary.
