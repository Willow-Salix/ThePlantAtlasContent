## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida), Mexico, Central America, West Indies, and northern South America. |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Humid Forests, including coastal hammocks, cypress swamps, and pine flatwoods. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. Avoid harsh, direct midday sun which can scorch its leaves. |
| **Watering** | Frequent watering, typically 2-3 times per week, via soaking for 20-30 minutes or thorough misting. Ensure complete drying within 4 hours after watering to prevent rot. |

## Introduction
Tillandsia is a genus of around 650 species of evergreen, perennial flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae, native to the forests, mountains and deserts of the Neotropics, from northern Mexico and the southeastern United States to Mesoamerica and the Caribbean to central Argentina. Their leaves, more or less silvery in color, are covered with specialized cells (trichomes) capable of rapidly absorbing water that gathers on them.
They are also commonly known as air plants because they obtain nutrients and water from the air, not needing soil for nourishment. They have a natural propensity to cling to whatever surfaces are readily available: telephone wires, tree branches, bark, bare rocks, etc. Their light seeds and a silky parachute facilitate their spread.  Most Tillandsia species are epiphytes – which translates to 'upon a plant'. Some are aerophytes, which have a minimal root system and grow on shifting desert soil. Due to their epiphytic way of life, these plants will not grow in soil but live on the branches of trees, in deserts and on other substrates that will not be saturated with water for very long.

## Care Guide
The Spreading Airplant, a subtropical epiphyte, thrives in bright, indirect light and high humidity. It requires frequent watering by soaking or misting, ensuring it dries completely afterwards, and benefits from occasional very dilute air plant fertilizer to mimic its natural nutrient uptake from rain and detritus.

### Fertilizer
Very dilute, air plant specific liquid fertilizer applied once every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring/summer).
