## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forests, Boreal Forests, and Montane biomes, characterized by high atmospheric humidity. |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to bright indirect light, mimicking conditions where its host lichens thrive on bark or rock surfaces, avoiding direct intense sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires very high ambient humidity and frequent exposure to atmospheric moisture (e.g., misting, dew, fog). Avoid prolonged periods of dryness or waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Phacopsis is a genus of lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) fungi. They are parasites of members of the large lichen family Parmeliaceae, of which they are also a member. Originally proposed by Edmond Tulasne in 1852 to contain 3 species, Phacopsis now contains 10 species, although historically, 33 taxa have been described in the genus. Many of the species are poorly known, some of them having been documented only from the type specimen.
Phacopsis species appear as partially immersed, shiny brown to black apothecia that cause gall-like deformations on the thallus of the host lichen. Features of Phacopsis used to distinguish species from each other include the shape of their spores, and the colour and reaction of the hypothecium (a tissue layer under the spore-bearing hymenium) when stained using an iodine–starch test. Since Phacopsis fungi are usually restricted to living on hosts belonging to a single phylogenetic clade, the identity of the host lichen is another diagnostic character used to identify species.

## Care Guide
Phacopsis thallicola is a parasitic lichenicolous fungus that is virtually impossible to cultivate outside of its natural ecosystem, as it requires specific host lichens. Its survival hinges on consistent high atmospheric humidity, clean air, and moderate indirect light conditions. Traditional plant care methods are not applicable and would be harmful.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens are extremely sensitive to nutrient enrichment and pollutants; traditional fertilizers would be detrimental.
