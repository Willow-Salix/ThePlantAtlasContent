# Alectoria subcana
### *Alectoria subcana (Nyl. ex Stizenb.) Gyel.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar distribution in the Northern Hemisphere, including boreal and subalpine regions of North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska), Europe (e.g., Scandinavia), and Asia (e.g., Siberia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Boreal Forest, Subalpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect to partial sunlight. Requires filtered light or dappled shade, avoiding intense direct sun which can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High ambient humidity is crucial. Lichens absorb moisture directly from the air; regular misting or placement in a humid environment is necessary. Avoid standing water; allow to dry slightly between rehydration. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, humid conditions with indirect light, mimicking its native boreal forest habitat. Provide high ambient humidity through misting, but ensure good air circulation to prevent issues. No fertilizer is needed as lichens are sensitive to nutrient enrichment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens are highly sensitive to nutrient enrichment; excessive nutrients can be harmful.
