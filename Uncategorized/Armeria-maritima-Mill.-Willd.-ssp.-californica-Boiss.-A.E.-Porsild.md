## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal California, extending north into coastal Oregon and Washington |
| **Climate** | Coastal Mediterranean (characterized by cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers, often with coastal fog) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is preferred. Tolerates some partial shade, especially in very hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growing season (cooler months), allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal to no supplemental water in summer. |

## Introduction
Armeria is a genus of flowering plants.  These plants are sometimes known as "lady's cushion", "thrift", or "sea pink" (the latter because as they are often found on coastlines).  The genus counts over a hundred species, mostly native to the Mediterranean, although Armeria maritima is an exception, being distributed along the coasts of the Northern Hemisphere, including Ireland, parts of the United Kingdom such as Cornwall, and the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park in Wales.
Some are popular with gardeners as rockery plants.
During the Second World War, the UK "thruppenny bit" coin (3 old pence), which had featured a portcullis on its reverse side, changed to a depiction of the thrift plant, as a means of reminding the population of the need to avoid waste and practise thrift.  After the war, it reverted to the portcullis

## Care Guide
California Seapink thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, mirroring its native coastal bluffs. It requires moderate watering during its active growing season but is highly drought-tolerant once established. This low-maintenance plant generally does not need heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
