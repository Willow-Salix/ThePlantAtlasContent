## Introduction
Lemna is a genus of free-floating aquatic plants referred to by the common name "duckweed". They are morphologically divergent members of the arum family Araceae. These rapidly growing plants have found uses as a model system for studies in community ecology, basic plant biology, ecotoxicology, and production of biopharmaceuticals, and as a source of animal feeds for agriculture and aquaculture. Currently, 14 species of Lemna are recognised.

## Care Guide
This aquatic plant thrives when continuously submerged in fresh water, favoring conditions from full sun to partial shade. Due to its rapid growth, it requires high nutrient levels, making regular liquid fertilization crucial for optimal health and dense mat formation.

### Fertilizer
High nutrient availability in water, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, benefiting from regular liquid fertilization.
