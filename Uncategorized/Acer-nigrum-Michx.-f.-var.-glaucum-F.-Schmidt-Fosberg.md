## Introduction
Acer nigrum, the black maple, is a species of maple closely related to A. saccharum (sugar maple), and treated by some authors as a subspecies of it, as Acer saccharum subsp. nigrum.
Identification can be confusing due to the tendency of the two species to form hybrids. The simplest and most accurate method for distinguishing between the two trees is the generally three-lobed leaves of the black maple versus the generally five-lobed leaves of the sugar maple. The leaves of the black maple also tend to have a drooping appearance. Other differences that are not as pronounced include darker, more deeply grooved bark, slightly smaller seeds, a downy underside, and thicker petioles. Hybrids are intermediate in their characteristics.

## Care Guide
The Black Maple thrives in temperate climates, preferring full sun but tolerating partial shade. It requires consistently moist, well-drained, nutrient-rich soil and benefits from regular watering, especially during dry spells. Replicating its native deciduous forest environment, with good soil organic matter, will ensure its healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Benefits from nutrient-rich soil, such as those high in organic matter. A balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring.
