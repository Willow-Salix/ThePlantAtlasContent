## Care Guide
San Diego nightshade thrives in Mediterranean climates, requiring full sun and well-draining soil. Water moderately during cooler growing seasons, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant in summer, needing minimal to no supplemental irrigation once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, ideally in early spring with a balanced, slow-release formula. Thrives in leaner soils and does not require heavy feeding.
