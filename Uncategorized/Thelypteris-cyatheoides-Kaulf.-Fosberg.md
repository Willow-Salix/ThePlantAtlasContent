## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (endemic) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to deep shade. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch its delicate fronds. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil. Requires frequent watering to prevent the soil from drying out, mimicking its native high rainfall environment. High humidity is also essential. |

## Introduction
Thelypteris (maiden ferns) is a genus of ferns in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, family Thelypteridaceae, order Polypodiales. Two radically different circumscriptions of the genus are in use as of January 2020. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the genus is a very small one with about two species. In other approaches, the genus is the only one in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, and so includes between 875 and 1083 species.
The genus name is from Greek thēlys "female" and pteris "fern". However, "female fern" usually refers to the common lady-fern.

## Care Guide
To thrive, the Lacy Maiden Fern requires conditions similar to its native Hawaiian wet forest habitat: consistent moisture, high humidity, and partial to deep shade. Ensure the soil never fully dries out, and provide very light fertilization during warmer months.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Use a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly during the active growing season (spring and summer), typically once a month or less.
