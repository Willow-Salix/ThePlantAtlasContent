## Introduction
Linanthus is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the phlox family Polemoniaceae. The species are found in western North America and in Chile, with the greatest diversity in California.
The stems are erect, with multiple branches arising directly from the base, and grow 2–15 cm tall. The leaves are stem-like (cauline) and opposite, with shapes ranging from entire to palmately lobed, the 3-9 lobes being linear to lanceolate or spatulate. Flowers have a tubular calyx, and the corolla may be funnel- or bell-shaped, or salverform.
The genus name is from the Greek for "flax flower", since the flowers superficially resemble those of flax. The genus has recently been split, with many of the species formerly included now transferred to the genus Leptosiphon (Jepson Manual).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, mimicking its native Mediterranean scrubland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, particularly once established. Avoid rich soils and heavy fertilization to promote robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to average, well-draining soils. No regular fertilization is typically needed once established. If desired, a very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once annually in spring.
