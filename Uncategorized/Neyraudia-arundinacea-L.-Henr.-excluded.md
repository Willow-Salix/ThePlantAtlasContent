| **Native Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical Asia (including India, China, Southeast Asia), Australia, and Madagascar. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Grassland/Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; performs optimally and grows most robustly in full, direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to high watering during the active growing season (warm, wet periods); tolerates drier spells and is drought-tolerant once established, requiring less water during cooler or dormant periods. |

## Care Guide
Madagascar Grass thrives in full sun and requires consistent, moderate to high watering during its active growth phase, though it is quite drought-tolerant once established. It benefits from light to moderate fertilization in warmer months. Mimicking its tropical grassland origins, it prefers open, warm environments.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer during the active growing season is beneficial, especially in poorer soils.
