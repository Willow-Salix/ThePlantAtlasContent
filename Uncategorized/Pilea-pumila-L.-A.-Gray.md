## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (Canada, USA) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial to full shade, tolerates some indirect light. Avoid direct, intense sunlight, as it naturally grows in the understory. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking its native damp woodland habitat. Do not allow soil to dry out completely, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Pilea pumila, commonly known as clearweed, Canadian clearweed, coolwort or richweed, is an herbaceous plant in the nettle family (Urticaceae). It is native to Asia and eastern North America, where it is broadly distributed.
This plant is most often found in rich loamy soil, usually in moist to wet areas. Its natural habitat is in forests or other lightly shaded conditions. It is a common plant throughout its range, and forms large colonies where it is found. It grows in both high-quality habitats and in ecologically degraded areas. Due to its high tolerance for disturbance, it is often seen near buildings and as a garden weed.

## Care Guide
Canadian Clearweed thrives in conditions that mimic its native moist woodland floor. Provide consistent moisture, ensuring the soil never dries out completely, and keep it in partial to full shade away from direct sun. A low to moderate feeding schedule supports its growth in rich organic soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring/summer). Less is needed in fall/winter.
