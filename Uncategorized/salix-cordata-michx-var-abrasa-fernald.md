## 🧤 Care Instructions
This willow thrives in full sun and consistently wet soil, making it ideal for planting along pond edges, streams, or in boggy areas. It demands high moisture and is drought-intolerant, requiring only minimal fertilization in healthy soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally does not require heavy fertilization. A balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied annually in spring if soil is particularly poor.
