## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
This lupine thrives in full sun with excellent drainage, typical of its native serpentine soils in California's Coast Ranges. It requires minimal water once established, adapting to dry summers, and needs little to no fertilizer, especially nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume adapted to nutrient-poor (serpentine) soils, it is sensitive to rich soils and excessive nitrogen.
