## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native alpine environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and avoid rich fertilizers. It is well-adapted to lean soils and drought conditions once established.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Thrives in lean, rocky soils characteristic of its native alpine habitat and does not require rich fertilization.
