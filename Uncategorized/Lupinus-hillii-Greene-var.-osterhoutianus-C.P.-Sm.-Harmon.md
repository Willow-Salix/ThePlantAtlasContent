## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (primarily Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Nebraska) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its growth in open slopes and prairies at higher elevations. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; water regularly during active growth, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established but performs best with consistent moisture during dry periods. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Osterhout's lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, consistent with its native temperate montane habitats. It requires moderate, consistent watering during its growing season but is drought-tolerant once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it needs minimal to no additional fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; as a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen and enriches the soil, thriving in lean to moderately fertile soils. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
