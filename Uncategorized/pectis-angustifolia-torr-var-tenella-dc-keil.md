## 🌱 Overview
Pectis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1759.
The name is derived from the Latin word pecten, meaning "comb." It refers to the marginally-bristled leaves or the pappus form.  These plants vary in appearance but they usually bear yellow daisy-like flower heads. Members of the genus are known generally as cinchweeds (current usage) or chinchweeds (older name).
They are native to the Americas, including the West Indies.
