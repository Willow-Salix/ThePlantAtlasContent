## Care Guide
This native grass thrives in conditions mimicking its temperate dry woodland and savanna origins, requiring partial to full sun and exceptionally well-drained, sandy soil. It is notably drought-tolerant once established, needing infrequent watering. Fertilization should be kept minimal due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils.
