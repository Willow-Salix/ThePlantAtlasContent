## Care Guide
Softleaf Panicgrass is a low-maintenance plant that prefers full sun to partial shade and moderate watering, indicative of its warm temperate grassland origin. It tolerates some drought and generally requires minimal fertilization, thriving best in well-drained soils typical of open woodlands and clearings.

### Fertilizer
Generally a light feeder. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer can be applied once in spring, but it often does well without additional fertilization in reasonably fertile soil.
