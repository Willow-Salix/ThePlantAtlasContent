## Introduction
The genus Platanthera belongs to the subfamily Orchidoideae of the family Orchidaceae, and comprises about 150 species of orchids. The members of this genus, known as the butterfly orchids or fringed orchids, were previously included in the genus Orchis, which is a close relative (along with the genus Habenaria). They are distributed throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are terrestrial and have tubercules. The genomes of Platanthera zijinensis and Platanthera guangdongensis have been sequenced as model species to study partial and full mycoheterotrophy.

## Care Guide
The Purple-Petal Bog Orchid thrives in consistently wet, acidic, and nutrient-poor conditions typical of its native bogs and wet meadows. It requires bright light, ranging from full sun to partial sun, and constant moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, if at all, to avoid shocking this delicate, bog-adapted species.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; bog soils are naturally nutrient-poor. If absolutely necessary, use a highly diluted, balanced orchid-specific fertilizer once a year.
