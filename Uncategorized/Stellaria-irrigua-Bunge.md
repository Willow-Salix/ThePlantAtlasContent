## Care Guide
This alpine native thrives in cool, high-elevation conditions with abundant moisture. Provide full sun in cool climates or partial shade elsewhere, ensuring the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained. Minimal fertilization is needed.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soil. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied in spring, but over-fertilization should be avoided.
