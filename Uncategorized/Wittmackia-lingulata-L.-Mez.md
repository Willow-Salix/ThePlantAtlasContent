## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil) and Trinidad and Tobago |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade is ideal, mimicking its natural habitat under the rainforest canopy. Avoid direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | The central 'cup' should be kept filled with clean water (preferably rainwater or distilled water) and flushed every few weeks to prevent stagnation. The potting medium, if applicable, should be kept consistently moist but well-drained, never waterlogged. |

## Care Guide
This tropical epiphyte thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light. Maintain a consistently moist environment by keeping its central cup filled with fresh water and the growing medium evenly damp. Fertilize sparingly during warmer months to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
As an epiphyte, it is a light feeder. Apply a diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/2 strength) to the central cup or as a foliar spray once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer).
