# Howell's Quillwort
### *Isoetes howellii Engelm.*

![Howell's Quillwort](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Isoetes_tegetiformans.jpg)

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Seasonal Wetland (specifically vernal pools within Mediterranean or Temperate zones) |
| **☀️ Light** | High light (full sun) when active, as vernal pools are typically open and exposed. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires constant inundation or bog-like conditions during its active growth phase (fall to spring), followed by a distinct dry, dormant period in summer when the pools naturally evaporate. It is adapted to fluctuate between submerged and dry states. |

## 🌱 Overview
Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of lycopod. It is the only living genus in the family Isoetaceae and order Isoetales. As of 2016, there were about 200 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution mostly in aquatic habitats but with the individual species often scarce to rare. Species virtually identical to modern quillworts have existed since the Jurassic epoch, though the timing of the origin of modern Isoetes is subject to considerable uncertainty.
The name of the genus may also be spelled Isoëtes. The diaeresis (two dots over the e) indicates that the o and the e are to be pronounced in two distinct syllables. Including this in print is optional; either spelling (Isoetes or Isoëtes) is correct.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Howell's Quillwort thrives by mimicking its native vernal pool habitat, requiring high light and constant moisture or inundation during its active fall-to-spring growth cycle. A critical dry, dormant period in summer is essential for its survival, and it prefers nutrient-poor substrates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Vernal pool environments are generally nutrient-poor, and high nutrient levels can be detrimental.
