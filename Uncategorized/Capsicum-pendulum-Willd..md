## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Andean regions of South America, primarily Peru and Bolivia, extending into parts of Argentina and Chile. |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Highland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6-8+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and fruit production, mirroring its open, sunny native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist but well-draining soil. Water regularly, allowing the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce frequency slightly during cooler or dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Capsicum () is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family Solanaceae, native to the Americas, cultivated worldwide for their edible fruit, which are generally known as "peppers" or "capsicum". Chili peppers grow on five species of Capsicum. Sweet or bell peppers and some chili peppers are Capsicum annuum, making it the most cultivated species in the genus.

## Care Guide
This pepper thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, replicating its native Andean climate. Consistent watering and regular feeding, especially with phosphorus and potassium during fruiting, are crucial for optimal growth and a bountiful harvest.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high feeder. Use a balanced fertilizer during vegetative growth, transitioning to one higher in phosphorus and potassium once flowering and fruiting begins. Fertilize every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season.
