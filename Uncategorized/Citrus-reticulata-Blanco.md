## Care Guide
To thrive, Tangerine plants require full sun exposure and consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions to prevent root issues. Regular fertilization during the growing season is crucial for healthy foliage and bountiful fruit production, reflecting their needs in their subtropical native habitat.
