## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Subarctic and Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Canada (Labrador), Greenland, and Northern Europe (Fennoscandia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subarctic/Arctic Tundra, Boreal Forest margins (damp, acidic areas like bogs and fens) |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium light; prefers partial shade to indirect light to prevent desiccation. Can tolerate more light in consistently damp and cool conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high moisture levels and high ambient humidity. The substrate should never be allowed to dry out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This subarctic moss thrives in consistently cool, moist conditions with high ambient humidity and low to medium light. Ensure the substrate remains damp and provide indirect light, as it has very low nutrient requirements and does not need regular fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; mosses are adapted to low-nutrient environments and can be harmed by excessive fertilization.
