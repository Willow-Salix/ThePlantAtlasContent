It includes 34 species and is broadly distributed across the continents of America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, as well as Madagascar and New Zealand.

## Care Guide
The Common Candle Snuffer Moss thrives in bright, exposed conditions on well-drained substrates. It is highly tolerant of drought and requires infrequent watering. Fertilizer is generally unnecessary, making it a low-maintenance bryophyte suited for challenging environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low; not typically required. Mosses absorb nutrients from rainwater and air; if desired, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be used very sparingly.
