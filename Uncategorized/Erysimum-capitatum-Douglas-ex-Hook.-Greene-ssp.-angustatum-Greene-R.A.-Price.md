## Introduction
Erysimum, or wallflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the cabbage family, Brassicaceae. It includes more than 150 species, both popular garden plants and many wild forms. Erysimum is characterised by star-shaped (and/or two-sided) trichomes growing from the stem, with yellow, red, pink or orange flowers and multiseeded seed pods.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization to prevent overgrowth. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid excessive moisture.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to average, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
