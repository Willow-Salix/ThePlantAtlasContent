## Introduction
Vaccinium  vack-SIN-ee-əm is a common and widespread genus of shrubs or dwarf shrubs in the heath family (Ericaceae). The fruits of many species are eaten by humans and some are of commercial importance, including the cranberry, blueberry, bilberry (whortleberry), lingonberry (cowberry), and huckleberry. Like many other heath plants, they are restricted to acidic soils.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, moist, and acidic conditions, characteristic of its native subarctic bog habitat. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil remains consistently wet, never allowing it to dry out. Fertilization should be very minimal, if at all, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. If necessary, use a very dilute, acid-specific fertilizer sparingly.
