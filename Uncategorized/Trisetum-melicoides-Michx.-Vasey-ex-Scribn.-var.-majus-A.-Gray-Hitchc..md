## Care Guide
This cool-season grass thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil under partial to full shade, mirroring its native forest habitat. Provide regular watering to prevent drying out and offer light to moderate fertilization in spring to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring, or liquid fertilizer at half strength every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.
