| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., United States, Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. As it thrives in open fields and disturbed areas, it requires ample direct sunlight for robust growth. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Tolerant of dry conditions once established, reflecting its native habitat with seasonal rainfall and periods of dryness. Allow soil to dry between waterings. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its open native grassland habitat. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and requires only low to moderate fertilizer due to its adaptability to less fertile soils. Overall, it's a hardy plant preferring well-drained soil and abundant light.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Naturally grows in average to poor, often disturbed soils, so excessive fertilization is not required. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly if soil nutrients are very low.
