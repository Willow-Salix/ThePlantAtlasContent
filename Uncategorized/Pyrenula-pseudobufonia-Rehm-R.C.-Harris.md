| **Native Origin** | Pantropical; widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to indirect light; avoids direct, intense sunlight due to its epiphyllous or corticolous habit under a dense canopy. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is crucial; requires constant atmospheric moisture and frequent exposure to rain or mist. It does not absorb water via roots. |

## Care Guide
As a lichen from humid tropical rainforests, Pyrenula pseudobufonia thrives in high humidity and indirect light conditions. It requires constant atmospheric moisture and frequent misting rather than traditional soil watering, and does not need external fertilization as it derives nutrients from the air and precipitation.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required; obtains nutrients from atmospheric deposition and precipitation on its substrate.
