## Introduction
Acanthocereus is a genus of cacti. Its species take the form of shrubs with arching or climbing stems up to several meters in height.  The generic name is derived from the Greek word άκανθα (acantha), meaning spine, and the Latin word cereus, meaning candle. The genus is native to the mostly tropical Americas from Texas and the southern tip of Florida to the northern part of South America (Colombia and Venezuela), including islands of the Caribbean.

## Care Guide
This resilient cactus thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native subtropical arid scrubland habitat. Provide infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and minimal fertilization during the active growing season to ensure its robust health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; feed with a balanced, diluted cactus fertilizer once or twice during the growing season (spring/summer).
