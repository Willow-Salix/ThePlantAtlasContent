| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of South America (e.g., Andean countries like Chile, Argentina, Peru) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland or Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight) to partial sun. Its silvery foliage suggests adaptation to high light. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings, as it is adapted to periods of drought. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Gamochaeta is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. There has not always been agreement among botanists regarding its status as a recognized genus, but it has become more accepted in recent years. It currently includes many plants that previously belonged in genus Gnaphalium. Like many species of Gnaphalium, many Gamochaeta are called cudweeds or everlastings.
Gamochaeta are native to North and South America, with one species endemic to Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic. Some species are found in other regions as introduced species outside of their native ranges, and sometimes as invasive noxious weeds.
Plants of this genus have "relatively small heads in spiciform (spike-like) arrays, concave post-fruiting receptacles, truncate collecting appendages of style branches in bisexual florets, relatively small cypselae (fruits) with minute, mucilage-producing papilliform hairs on the faces, and pappus bristles basally connate (joined) in smooth rings and released as single units."

## Care Guide
Silvery Everlasting prefers full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native temperate grassland and montane origins. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, and fertilize sparingly as it is not a heavy feeder.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant thrives in average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer application once a year in spring is usually sufficient.
