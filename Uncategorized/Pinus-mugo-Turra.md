## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Southern Europe, specifically the mountains of the Alps, Carpathians, Balkans, and Apennines. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra to Subalpine Coniferous Forest, characterized by cold winters, cool summers, and high light exposure. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in open, exposed mountain slopes above or at the treeline. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It thrives in well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant once established. |

## Introduction
Pinus mugo, known as dwarf mountain pine, mountain pine,  scrub mountain pine, Swiss mountain pine, bog pine, creeping pine, or mugo pine, is a species of conifer, native to high elevation habitats from southwestern to Central Europe and Southeast Europe.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Mugo Pine requires full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native exposed mountain habitat. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between sessions, and fertilize sparingly as it is adapted to lean alpine conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Native alpine soils are often lean, so a balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring.
