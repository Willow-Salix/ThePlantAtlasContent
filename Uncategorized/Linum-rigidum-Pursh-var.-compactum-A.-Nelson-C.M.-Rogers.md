## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western and Central United States (e.g., Arizona, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming) and parts of Western Canada. |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-arid Grasslands, Prairies, and Sagebrush Steppe; Temperate Dryland. |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open, exposed plains and dry slopes. |
| **Watering** | Low to Moderate; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. This plant is highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to regions with infrequent rainfall. |

## Introduction
Linum (flax) is a genus of approximately 200 species in the flowering plant family Linaceae. They are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the world. The genus includes the common flax (L. usitatissimum), the bast fibre of which is used to produce linen and the seeds to produce linseed oil.

The flowers of most species are blue or yellow, rarely red, white, or pink, and some are heterostylous. There is an average of 6 to 10 seeds per boll.
Linum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the cabbage moth, the nutmeg, the setaceous Hebrew character and Coleophora striolatella, which feeds exclusively on Linum narbonense.

## Care Guide
Compact Stiffstem Flax requires full sun and well-draining soil, thriving in conditions similar to its native arid grasslands. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization to mimic its natural, lean soil environment.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean to moderately fertile soil. Over-fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful, as it thrives in the less nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat.
