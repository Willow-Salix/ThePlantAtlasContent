## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cold-hardy birch thrives in full to partial sun and demands consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting its boreal forest origins. Focus on providing adequate moisture and sunlight, as established trees typically require minimal fertilization. Ensure it is protected from prolonged periods of heat and drought, which are not typical of its native environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring if growth is poor or soil is nutrient-deficient; otherwise, established trees often need minimal fertilization.
