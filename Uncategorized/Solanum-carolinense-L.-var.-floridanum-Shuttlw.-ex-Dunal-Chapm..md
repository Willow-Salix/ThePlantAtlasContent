## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States, specifically Florida |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. It naturally grows in open fields and disturbed areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; consistent moisture is preferred during the growing season, especially reflecting Florida's summer wet season. Allow the top soil to dry slightly between waterings, but it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. |

## Introduction
Solanum is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants, which include three food crops of high economic importance: the potato, the tomato and the eggplant (aubergine, brinjal). It is the largest genus in the nightshade family Solanaceae, comprising around 1,500 species. It also contains the so-called horse nettles (unrelated to the genus of true nettles, Urtica), as well as numerous plants cultivated for their ornamental flowers and fruit.
Solanum species show a wide range of growth habits, such as annuals and perennials, vines, subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees. Many formerly independent genera like Lycopersicon (the tomatoes) and Cyphomandra are now included in Solanum as subgenera or sections. Thus, the genus today contains roughly 1,500–2,000 species.

## Care Guide
Thriving in open, sunny environments within a humid subtropical climate, Florida Horsenettle requires full to partial sun exposure. It needs moderate watering to maintain consistent soil moisture during its active growth, though it exhibits good drought tolerance once established. Fertilizer requirements are low, as it can flourish in average to poor soil conditions without significant nutrient supplementation.

### Fertilizer
Low; as a common plant of disturbed areas, it thrives in average to poor soils and typically does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring might be beneficial in very nutrient-depleted soils.
