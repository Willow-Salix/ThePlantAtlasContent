# Pinnatifid Shield Lichen

*Parmelia omphalodes (L.) Ach. ssp. pinnatifida (Kurok.) Skult* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions with oceanic influence, including parts of Northern Europe (e.g., British Isles, Scandinavia), North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Atlantic Canada), and Northern Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Oceanic/Montane (characterized by cool temperatures, high atmospheric humidity, and frequent precipitation). |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. While it can tolerate some direct sun in its native cloudy environments, protect from intense, prolonged direct sunlight, especially if humidity is low. |
| **Watering** | Does not require watering in the traditional sense; thrives on high atmospheric humidity and frequent moisture from rain or mist. Regular misting in a home environment is crucial to simulate its native conditions. Avoid waterlogging if placed on a substrate. |

## Introduction
Parmelia may refer to:

Parmelia (barque), the vessel that in 1829 transported the first settlers of the British colony of Western Australia
Parmelia (fungus), a genus of lichens with global distribution
Parmelia, Western Australia, a suburb of Kwinana, Western Australia

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, highly humid environments with bright indirect to partial sun exposure, mimicking its native oceanic/montane habitat. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture through frequent misting and should never be fertilized, as it absorbs nutrients directly from the air.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens absorb all necessary nutrients from the air and precipitation, and traditional fertilizers can be harmful.
