## 🌱 Overview
Schoenoplectus (club-rush [Old World species], bulrush or tule [New World species]) is a genus of plants in the sedge family with a cosmopolitan distribution. Note that the name bulrush is also applied to species in the unrelated genus Typha as well as to other sedges. The genus Schoenoplectus was formerly considered part of Scirpus, but recent phylogenetic data shows that they are not closely related.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wetland plant thrives in consistently saturated to submerged conditions, requiring abundant water mimicking its native marsh habitats. It prefers full sun to partial sun exposure and benefits from moderate fertilization to support its vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced aquatic or slow-release fertilizer during its active growing season, consistent with nutrient availability in wetland environments.
