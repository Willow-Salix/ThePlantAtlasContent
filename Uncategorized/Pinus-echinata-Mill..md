## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern and south-central United States (from southeastern New York to northern Florida, and west to eastern Oklahoma and Texas) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical, Temperate Forest (specifically Southeastern Conifer and Mixed Pine-Hardwood Forests) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth; intolerant of shade). |
| **Watering** | Moderate; consistent moisture is important for young trees to establish deep roots. Once mature, it is highly drought-tolerant due to its adaptation to periods of dry weather in its native range, requiring supplemental water only during prolonged, severe droughts. |

## Introduction
The shortleaf pine or Pinus echinata is a species of coniferous tree endemic to the United States. The shortleaf pine is sometimes referred to as the "old field", "spruce", "rosemary", "yellow", "two-leaf" and "heart" pine. The common name "shortleaf pine" may refer to other species like loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), based on a custom in the Southeastern United States to only refer to pines as either "long-leaf" or "short-leaf". However, P. echinata can be distinguished from other pines by examining its short leaves and small cones.

## Care Guide
Shortleaf Pine requires full sun and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils, mirroring its native Southeastern U.S. environment. Young trees need consistent watering for root establishment, but mature pines are exceptionally drought-tolerant. Fertilization should be minimal, primarily focusing on supporting initial growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to moderate; established trees generally do not require heavy fertilization, thriving in the typically well-drained, often acidic and nutrient-poor to moderate soils of its native habitat. Young trees may benefit from a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during establishment.
