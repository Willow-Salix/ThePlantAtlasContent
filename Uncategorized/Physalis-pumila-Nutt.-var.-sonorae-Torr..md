## Introduction
Physalis (, , , , from Ancient Greek: φυσαλλίς phusallís 'bladder') is a genus of approximately 75 to 90 flowering plants in the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which are native to the Americas and Australasia. At least 46 species are endemic to Mexico. Cultivated and weedy species have been introduced worldwide. A defining feature of Physalis is a large, papery husk derived from the calyx, which partly or fully encloses the fruit. Many species bear edible fruit, and some species are cultivated.
The typical Physalis fruit is similar to a firm tomato in texture, and like a sweet, tangy grape in flavor. Some species, such as the Cape gooseberry and tomatillo, have been bred into many cultivars with varying flavors, from tart to sweet to savory. Nations including Colombia, India, and Mexico have a significant economic trade in Physalis fruit. The fruits of many species are generically referred to as physalis, groundcherries, husk tomatoes, husk cherries, poha berries, and golden berries.

## Care Guide
To care for the Sonoran Groundcherry, provide full sun exposure and well-draining soil, mirroring its arid native environment. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between sessions, and use fertilizer sparingly as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in moderately fertile to poor soils and requires minimal supplemental fertilization.
