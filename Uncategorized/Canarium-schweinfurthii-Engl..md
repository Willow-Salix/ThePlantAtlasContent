## Introduction
Canarium is a genus of about 120 species of tropical and subtropical trees, in the family Burseraceae.  They grow naturally across tropical Africa, south and southeast Asia, Indochina, Malesia, Australia and western Pacific Islands; including from southern Nigeria east to Madagascar, Mauritius, Sri Lanka and India; from Burma, Malaysia and Thailand through the Malay Peninsula and Vietnam to south China, Taiwan and the Philippines; through Borneo, Indonesia, Timor and New Guinea, through to the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Palau.
Canarium species grow up to large evergreen trees of 40–50 m (130–160 ft) tall, and have alternately arranged, pinnate leaves. They are dioecious, with male and female flowers growing on separate trees.

## Care Guide
This tropical African tree thrives in conditions reminiscent of its rainforest origin. Provide ample bright light (full sun to partial shade) and ensure consistently moist, well-draining soil. Regular feeding during active growth will enhance its vigor and fruit yield.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high fertilization during the active growing season, especially when fruiting, to support vigorous growth.
