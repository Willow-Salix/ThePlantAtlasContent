## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Southern California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland / Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open, exposed areas. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. This plant is drought-tolerant, adapted to the dry summers of its native Mediterranean climate. Requires excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Phacelia (phacelia, scorpionweed, heliotrope) is a genus of about 200 species of annual or perennial herbaceous plants in the borage family, native to North and South America. California is particularly rich in species with over 90 recorded in the region.
The genus is traditionally placed at family rank with the waterleafs (Hydrophyllaceae) in the order Boraginales. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, recognizing that the traditional Boraginaceae and Hydrophyllaceae are paraphyletic with respect to each other, merges the latter into the former and considers the family basal in the Euasterids I clade. Other botanists continue to recognize the Hydrophyllaceae and Boraginales after analysing the secondary structure of the ITS1 genetic region rather than its sequence for these higher taxonomic levels.  This placed Phacelia within the Hydrophyllaceae. Further molecular taxonomic analysis of the Boraginales has divided the Boraginales in two and placed Phacelia among the monophyletic herbaceous Hydrophyllaceae in Boraginales II.
The genus includes both annual and perennial species. Many have been cultivated as garden and honey plants.
There are reports that glandular hairs of stems, flowers and leaves of some species of Phacelia secrete oil droplets that can cause an unpleasant skin rash (contact dermatitis) in some people, specifically from P. brachyloba, P. campanularia, P. crenulata, P. gina-glenneae, P. grandiflora, P. ixodes, P. minor, and P. pedicellata. The major contact allergen of P. crenulata has been identified as geranylhydroquinone and of P. minor as geranylgeranylhydroquinone.
The mining bee Andrena phaceliae is a specialist pollinator of this genus in the Eastern United States.

## Care Guide
Douglas' Phacelia thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean scrubland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering, especially once established. This plant generally requires minimal to no supplemental fertilizer to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; it thrives in the lean, poor to moderately fertile soils typical of its native scrublands and grasslands.
