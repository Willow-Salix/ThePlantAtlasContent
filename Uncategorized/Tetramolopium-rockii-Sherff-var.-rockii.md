## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (specifically Molokaʻi and Lānaʻi) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Coastal Shrubland/Dune Ecosystem |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, as it thrives in open, exposed coastal areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is needed, but critically, the soil must be allowed to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. It is drought-tolerant once established. |

## Introduction
Tetramolopium is a genus of plants in the tribe Astereae within the family Asteraceae.
Most of the species are native to New Guinea, 11 species are found in Hawaii, and one in the Cook Islands, with the island populations apparently representing a recent (by evolutionary standards) colonization.  It is related to Camptacra, Kippistia, Minuria, Peripleura, and Vittadinia all of which are from Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, or Pacific islands.

## Care Guide
Dune Tetramolopium demands abundant direct sunlight and extremely well-draining, sandy soil, reflecting its native Hawaiian coastal dune habitat. Water moderately, always ensuring the soil completely dries out between applications to prevent rot, and fertilize very sparingly. Providing good air circulation and mimicking these conditions are crucial for its successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor dune soils, it benefits from a very dilute, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly once or twice during the active growing season, or potentially none if grown in well-amended soil.
