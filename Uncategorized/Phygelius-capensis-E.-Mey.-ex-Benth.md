## Introduction
Phygelius, common names Cape fuchsia or Cape figwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae, native to wet slopes and banks in southern Africa.  They are evergreen shrubs often treated as perennials in colder climates. They bear many pendent tubular flowers over a long period in summer, in shades of white, yellow and red. The vague similarity of the blooms to fuchsias has led to the common name Cape fuchsia, though they are not closely related.

## Care Guide
Cape-fuchsia thrives in a mild, subtropical environment, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide regular watering, particularly during dry spells, and a moderate feeding during its growing season to support vigorous growth and abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied during the growing season (spring/summer) is sufficient.
