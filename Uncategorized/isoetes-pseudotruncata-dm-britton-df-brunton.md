| **🌍 Origin** | South-eastern Queensland, Australia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Freshwater Wetlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect to direct light. Mimics open, shallow water conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent submersion in fresh water or highly saturated, muddy conditions. Should never be allowed to dry out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of lycopod. It is the only living genus in the family Isoetaceae and order Isoetales. As of 2016, there were about 200 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution mostly in aquatic habitats but with the individual species often scarce to rare. Species virtually identical to modern quillworts have existed since the Jurassic epoch, though the timing of the origin of modern Isoetes is subject to considerable uncertainty.
The name of the genus may also be spelled Isoëtes. The diaeresis (two dots over the e) indicates that the o and the e are to be pronounced in two distinct syllables. Including this in print is optional; either spelling (Isoetes or Isoëtes) is correct.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This aquatic to semi-aquatic plant thrives when consistently submerged in fresh water or kept in saturated, muddy conditions. Provide bright indirect to direct light. Fertilization should be low to moderate, ideally through a nutrient-rich substrate, to support healthy growth while avoiding algal blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from nutrients within the substrate rather than excessive liquid fertilization, to prevent algal growth.
