## Care Guide
Spreading Panicgrass is an Australian native adapted to tropical and subtropical savannas, thriving in full to partial sun. It requires moderate watering, preferring consistent moisture during its active growing season but tolerating periods of drought. Fertilization needs are low to moderate, supporting its growth in various soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer application once or twice during the growing season, particularly in nutrient-poor soils.
