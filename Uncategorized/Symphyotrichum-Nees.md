## Care Guide
Asters are robust plants native to temperate grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. They require moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and generally need minimal fertilization. This makes them relatively low-maintenance, colorful additions to many gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally adaptable to average garden soil. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can benefit growth in poorer soils but is often not strictly necessary.
