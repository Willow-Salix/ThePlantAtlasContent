| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Chihuahuan Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open desert and grassland habitats. |

The genus is named in honor of the German-American amateur botanist Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg (1753-1815). Many of the species are known by the common name muhly.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sand Muhly is a robust, drought-tolerant ornamental grass perfect for xeriscaping, thriving in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils. It requires minimal watering once established and generally needs no fertilization, reflecting its adaptation to arid environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Adapted to lean, sandy, nutrient-poor desert soils; excessive fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
