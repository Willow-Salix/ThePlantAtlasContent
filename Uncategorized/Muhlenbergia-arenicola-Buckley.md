| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Chihuahuan Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open desert and grassland habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low; drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings, especially once established, mimicking desert rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Muhlenbergia is a genus of plants in the grass family.
The genus is named in honor of the German-American amateur botanist Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg (1753-1815). Many of the species are known by the common name muhly.
The greatest number are native to the southwestern United States and Mexico, but there are also native species in Canada, Central and South America and in Asia.

## Care Guide
Sand Muhly is a robust, drought-tolerant ornamental grass perfect for xeriscaping, thriving in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils. It requires minimal watering once established and generally needs no fertilization, reflecting its adaptation to arid environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Adapted to lean, sandy, nutrient-poor desert soils; excessive fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
