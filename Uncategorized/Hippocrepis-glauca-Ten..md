## Care Guide
This Mediterranean native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring moderate watering that allows the substrate to dry out between sessions. Once established, it exhibits good drought tolerance, and generally requires only low to moderate fertilization, benefiting from a balanced, slow-release type if needed.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high nitrogen fertilizers; a balanced, slow-release formula or compost once annually should suffice.
