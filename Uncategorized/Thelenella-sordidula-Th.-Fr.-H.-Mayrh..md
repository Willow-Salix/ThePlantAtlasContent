## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate and Boreal regions of Europe and North America |
| **Climate** | Temperate and Boreal Humid Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Low to indirect light; partial to full shade, avoiding direct sun exposure. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity is crucial for this lichen. It absorbs moisture from the air, so consistent misting in drier indoor environments or placement in naturally humid settings is essential, but avoid standing water. |

## Introduction
Thelenella is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Thelenellaceae. These inconspicuous lichens form thin, crust-like growths that are tightly attached to their substrates and appear as dull whitish, pale grey, or light brown patches. Species of Thelenella are commonly found in damp, shaded environments where they grow on tree bark, living leaves, moss cushions, rock faces, and moss-rich soil. The genus is distinguished by its thick-walled fruiting bodies that are mostly embedded within the lichen crust and contain multicellular spores with multiple cross-walls.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, consistently humid conditions with low to indirect light, mimicking its native forest floor and bark habitats. It relies on atmospheric moisture and nutrients, therefore requiring high humidity rather than traditional watering or fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Not required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from the atmosphere and their substrate; conventional fertilizers can be detrimental.
