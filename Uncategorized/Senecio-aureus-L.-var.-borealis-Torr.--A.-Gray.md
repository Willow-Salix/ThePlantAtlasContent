## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America, specifically northern regions of the USA (e.g., New England, Great Lakes states) and Canada (e.g., Newfoundland to Manitoba). |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate (moist woodlands, wet meadows, bogs, and along streams in temperate forest biomes). |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Shade to Full Sun. While it can tolerate full sun, especially in cooler northern climates, it prefers partial shade, particularly in hotter regions to prevent leaf scorch, provided soil remains consistently moist. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil, never allowing it to dry out completely. Mimics its native boggy and moist woodland habitats. |
