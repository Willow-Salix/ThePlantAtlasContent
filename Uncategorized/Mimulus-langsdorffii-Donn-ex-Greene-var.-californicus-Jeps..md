## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
The Yellow Monkeyflower thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, replicating its native habitat along stream banks and seeps. It prefers bright light, from full sun to partial shade, and benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growth period. Ensure the soil never dries out to maintain its health and vibrant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring to summer) should suffice.
