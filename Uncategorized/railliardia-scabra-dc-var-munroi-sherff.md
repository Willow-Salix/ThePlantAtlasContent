## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian native thrives in bright light and well-draining soil, typical of its natural mesic to dry shrubland and forest habitats. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between sessions, and fertilize lightly to mimic its nutrient-poor native environment. Ensure good air circulation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Plants in its native habitat often grow in nutrient-poor, well-draining soils (e.g., lava flows). Use a diluted, balanced slow-release fertilizer sparingly during the growing season. Avoid over-fertilization.
