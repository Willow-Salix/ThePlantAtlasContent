## 🧤 Care Instructions
This terrestrial orchid thrives in consistently wet conditions characteristic of its native southeastern US marshes. Provide ample bright light to partial shade, ensuring the soil never dries out. It generally requires very little supplemental fertilization, favoring a lean, moist environment.
