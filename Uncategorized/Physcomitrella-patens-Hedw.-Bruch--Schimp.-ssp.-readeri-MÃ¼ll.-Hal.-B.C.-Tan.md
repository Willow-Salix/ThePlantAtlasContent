## Care Guide
Spreading Earthmoss thrives in consistently moist, humid environments with partial shade to indirect bright light. Ensure the substrate remains damp but not waterlogged to mimic its native wetland habitats. It has low nutrient requirements, making it relatively low-maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Low nutrient needs; thrives in moderately nutrient-poor to rich substrates.
