## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (from British Columbia south through the western United States into Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Temperate zones, often thriving in disturbed and open habitats such as agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, consistent with its native habitat in exposed, open environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. While somewhat drought-tolerant once established, it thrives with consistent moisture during its active growing season. |

## Introduction
Amaranthus powellii is a species of amaranth known by the common names Powell's amaranth and green amaranth.
It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, but it is common throughout most of the rest of the temperate Americas as a naturalized species. 
It has also been introduced to other continents, including Australia and Europe.

## Care Guide
Powell's amaranth is a robust annual that thrives in full sun and average, well-draining soil. Provide moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and light fertilization for optimal growth, mirroring its preference for open, moderately fertile environments.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. It can grow in average soils but benefits from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during its active growth, especially in nutrient-poor conditions.
