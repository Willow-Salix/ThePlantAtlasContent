## 🌱 Overview
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pearl Milkwort thrives in conditions replicating its native Mediterranean habitat. Provide full sun to partial shade, moderate water during fall-to-spring growth, and allow for a dry summer dormancy. It prefers well-draining soil and is generally drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring if soil is poor, but generally tolerant of lean soils.
