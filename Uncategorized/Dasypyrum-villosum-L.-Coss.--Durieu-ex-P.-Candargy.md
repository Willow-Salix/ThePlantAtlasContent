## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean region, including Southern Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland and Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open habitat in its native range. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry Mediterranean summers. Water moderately during active growth (fall/winter/spring), allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Minimal to no supplemental water needed during hot, dry summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Dasypyrum villosum is a species of annual grass in the family Poaceae. It is native to eastern and southern Europe  and Western Asia from the Balearic Islands to Turkmenistan, including in the Mediterranean and the Caucasus regions.

## Care Guide
Mosquitograss thrives in full sun and well-drained, even poor, soils, mimicking its Mediterranean origins. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring moderate water only during active growth in cooler months and tolerating dry conditions in summer. Minimal fertilization is typically needed.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to the often nutrient-poor soils of the Mediterranean. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be used if soil is exceptionally poor, but it is generally not a heavy feeder.
