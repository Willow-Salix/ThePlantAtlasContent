## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Wyoming) and northern Mexico, primarily in mountainous regions. |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid Montane Woodland and Scrub |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring brighter light exposure, especially in cooler, higher elevations. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established and susceptible to root rot in consistently wet conditions. |

## Introduction
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## Care Guide
Fendler's Bedstraw thrives in full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native semi-arid montane habitat. It requires moderate, infrequent watering, tolerating dry spells, and prefers lean, well-draining soils with minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor to average soils and typically does not require regular fertilization.
