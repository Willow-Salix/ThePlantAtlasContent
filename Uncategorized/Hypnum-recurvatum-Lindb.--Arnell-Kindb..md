## Care Guide
Recurved Hypnum Moss thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, mimicking its circumboreal origins. Provide consistent moisture to the substrate and maintain high humidity, while ensuring good drainage to prevent rot. Avoid direct, intense sunlight and excessive fertilization for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Mosses are adapted to nutrient-poor environments, often growing on rocks, decaying wood, or thin soil, and excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
