## Care Guide
Weeping Alkaligrass thrives in full sun and wet, even brackish, soil conditions, making it ideal for challenging landscapes. It is a low-maintenance plant, requiring minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-limited environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; it is adapted to nutrient-poor or saline soils and does not require rich amendments.
