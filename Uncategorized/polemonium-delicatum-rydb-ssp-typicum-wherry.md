## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada, Cascade Range) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine and Alpine Tundra/Meadow (Montane) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in bright conditions typical of high-altitude open areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, ensuring consistently moist but extremely well-drained soil. Mimic its native habitat by allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings, but avoid prolonged drought or waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Polemonium, commonly called Jacob's ladders or Jacob's-ladders (the name derived from the Biblical story), is a genus of between 25 and 40 species of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae, native to cool temperate to arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. One species, Polemonium micranthum, also occurs in the southern Andes in South America. Many of the species grow at high altitudes, in mountainous areas. Most of the uncertainty in the number of species relates to those in Eurasia, many of which have been synonymized with Polemonium caeruleum.
Polemonium are perennial plants (rarely annual plants) growing 10–120 cm tall with bright green leaves divided into lance-shaped leaflets. They produce blue (rarely white or pink) flowers in the spring and summer.
Some species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora polemoniella.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soil under full to partial sun, mirroring its native subalpine and alpine environments. Provide moderate, consistent moisture but prioritize excellent drainage to prevent root rot. It requires minimal fertilization, being adapted to lean, nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Native soils are typically lean and rocky; excessive fertilization can harm the plant. A very light, balanced granular fertilizer in early spring, if desired, is sufficient.
