## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and demands consistently moist soil, reflecting its native habitat in temperate wet meadows. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry periods, and provide moderate nutrients for healthy growth. It prefers fertile, organic-rich soil but can adapt to average conditions if moisture is maintained.

### Fertilizer
Moderate nutrient needs. Thrives in fertile, well-draining soil rich in organic matter, but can tolerate average to poor soils if moisture is consistent.
