| **Climate** | Temperate Forest and Temperate Grassland/Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight, reflecting its natural habitat in open prairies and forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during establishment. Once mature, it is drought-tolerant and prefers soil to dry slightly between waterings, typical of upland and prairie habitats. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This adaptable willow thrives in full sun and various soil types, preferring moderate water and little to no fertilizer. It's an excellent choice for open areas, tolerating dry conditions once established, reflecting its native habitat in North American prairies and forest edges.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adaptable to poor to moderately fertile soils. Fertilization is generally not required unless soil is extremely poor, reflecting its ability to thrive in nutrient-lean conditions.
