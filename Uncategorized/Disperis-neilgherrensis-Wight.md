## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light, mimicking its native montane forest habitat. Ensure consistent moisture in a well-draining medium and provide regular, dilute fertilization during its growing season to promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Apply a dilute, balanced orchid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during active growth. Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler or dormant periods.
