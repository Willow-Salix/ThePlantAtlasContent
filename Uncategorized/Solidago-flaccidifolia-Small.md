## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
This mountain goldenrod prefers full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native open forest and clearing habitats in the Appalachian Mountains. Provide consistent moisture through moderate watering, ensuring good drainage, and apply fertilizer sparingly as it adapts well to average soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; it is adapted to average to poor soil conditions found in its natural habitat and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient if growth is poor.
