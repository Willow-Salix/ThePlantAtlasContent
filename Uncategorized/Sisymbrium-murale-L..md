## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean region (Southern Europe, North Africa, Western Asia) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Temperate, Arid Scrubland/Grassland) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. As a plant of open, often disturbed sites and walls in its native range, it thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low watering. Given its native climate with dry summers, it is drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during hot, dry periods. |

## Introduction
Diplotaxis (wall-rocket) is a genus of 39 species of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae (Cruciferae), native to Europe, the Mediterranean region, Macaronesia, Western Asia, the Himalayas, and northeastern tropical Africa; the species diversity is highest in the Iberian Peninsula, North Africa and the Cape Verde archipelago. They are annual or perennial plants, either herbaceous or sub-shrubby with a woody base. The flowers are yellow in most species, but are white in Diplotaxis erucoides and violet in Diplotaxis acris. Some species, such as Diplotaxis tenuifolia and Diplotaxis muralis, have been historically used as leaf vegetables, are similar to Eruca sativa in their peppery flavour, and are used interchangeably with it.

## Care Guide
Wall Rocket is a resilient plant that thrives in full to partial sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its Mediterranean origin. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Naturally growing in less fertile, disturbed soils, it does not require significant fertilization. Excessive nutrients may even hinder its growth. If soil is extremely poor, a very diluted, balanced fertilizer once in spring might suffice.
