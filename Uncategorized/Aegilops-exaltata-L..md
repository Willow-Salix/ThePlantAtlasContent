## Care Guide
Aegilops exaltata is a resilient grass from arid steppes, demanding full sun and minimal water. It thrives on neglect regarding fertilization, preferring poor to average soils. Its primary needs are ample sunlight and well-draining conditions to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to poor to moderately fertile soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary, or only a very light, balanced application once a year if soil nutrients are extremely deficient.
