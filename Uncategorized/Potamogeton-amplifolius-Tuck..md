## Introduction
Potamogeton is a genus of aquatic, mostly freshwater, plants of the family Potamogetonaceae. Most are known by the common name pondweed, although many unrelated plants may be called pondweed, such as Canadian pondweed (Elodea canadensis). The genus name means "river neighbor", originating from the Greek potamos (river) and geiton (neighbor).

## Care Guide
Largeleaf Pondweed is an aquatic plant native to temperate North America, requiring continuous submergence in clean freshwater under full sun to partial shade. Provide moderate nutrient levels, primarily through the water and substrate, while avoiding over-fertilization to maintain healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate nutrient levels in the water column and substrate are sufficient; excessive fertilization should be avoided to prevent algal blooms.
