## Care Guide
Psorinia conglomerata is a lichen that thrives in the humid, filtered light conditions found in temperate deciduous forests. It requires high atmospheric moisture, absorbing water and nutrients directly from the air and its substrate, making traditional watering or fertilization unnecessary and potentially harmful.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization required. Lichens absorb nutrients from the air and their substrate; chemical fertilizers can be detrimental.
