## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Subarctic North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Greenland) |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra / Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure, especially during its short growing season, due to the open, treeless nature of its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist but very well-drained soil, mimicking snowmelt and permafrost conditions without waterlogging. Avoid overly dry or boggy conditions. |

This arctic plant thrives in full sun with consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor conditions, requiring minimal fertilization. Ensure cool temperatures and good air circulation for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Adapted to nutrient-poor, often acidic soils; requires minimal to no fertilization, or a very dilute, balanced feed sparingly during the growing season.
