| **Climate** | Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub (characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters). |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6-8+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open scrubland habitat where it is exposed to intense sunlight. |

## Care Guide
Adapted to Mediterranean climates, this plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and has minimal fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Prefers lean to moderately fertile soils. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and does not require heavy fertilization; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is typically sufficient if desired.
