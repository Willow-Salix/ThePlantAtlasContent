| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (Central and Southern Coast Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Significantly reduce or cease watering during winter dormancy and periods of extreme heat/summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Opuntia, commonly called the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family Cactaceae, many known for their flavorful fruit and showy flowers. Cacti are native to the Americas, and are well adapted to arid climates; however, they are still vulnerable to alterations in precipitation and temperature driven by climate change. The plant has been introduced to Australia, southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.
Prickly pear alone is also used to refer to the fruit, but may also be used for the plant itself; in addition, other names given to the plant and its specific parts include tuna (fruit), sabra, sabbar, nopal (pads, plural nopales, from the Nahuatl word nōpalli), nostle (fruit) from the Nahuatl word nōchtli, and paddle cactus. The genus is named for the Ancient Greek city of Opus. The fruit and leaves are edible. The most common culinary species is the "Barbary fig" (Opuntia ficus-indica).
In places where they have been introduced outside their native range, some species in the genus Opuntia behave as aggressive invasive species.

## Care Guide
This succulent thrives in conditions mimicking its native Californian Mediterranean shrubland, requiring abundant full sun and well-draining soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and feed with a low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer only during its spring growing period for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. Use a low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer, diluted to half strength, once or twice during the active growing season (spring).
