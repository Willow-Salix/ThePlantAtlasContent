## Care Guide
This rare terrestrial orchid requires conditions mimicking its humid subtropical understory habitat, thriving in low to medium indirect light with high humidity. Maintain consistent moisture during its growing period using a very dilute fertilizer, allowing for a drier rest period when dormant.

### Fertilizer
Apply a very dilute, balanced orchid-specific fertilizer (1/4 to 1/8 strength) every 2-4 weeks during active growth. Reduce or cease fertilization during dormancy.
