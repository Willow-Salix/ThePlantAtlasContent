| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest, Coastal Scrub, and Limestone Pinelands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, as it naturally occurs in exposed or semi-exposed tropical environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is accustomed to seasonal rainfall patterns with distinct dry periods and exhibits good drought tolerance once established. |

## Introduction
Stenocarpus sinuatus, known as the firewheel tree, is an Australian rainforest tree in the family Proteaceae. The range of natural distribution is in various rainforest types from the Nambucca River (30° S) in New South Wales to the Atherton Tableland (17° S) in tropical Queensland. Stenocarpus sinuatus is widely planted as an ornamental tree in other parts of Australia and in different parts of the world.
Other common names include the white beefwood, Queensland firewheel tree, tulip flower, white oak and white silky oak.

## Care Guide
White Beefwood thrives in warm, sunny conditions with well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Caribbean dry forest habitats. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between applications, and reduce watering in cooler or dormant periods. Provide a light, balanced fertilizer during active growth to support its development.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula during the active growing season (spring and summer). It is adapted to soils that are not exceptionally rich.
