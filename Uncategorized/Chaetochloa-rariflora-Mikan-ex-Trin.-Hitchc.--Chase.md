## Introduction
Setaria is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family. The name is derived from the Latin word seta, meaning "bristle" or "hair", which refers to the bristly spikelets.
The genus includes over 100 species distributed in many tropical and temperate regions around the world, and members are commonly known as foxtail or bristle grasses.

## Care Guide
This resilient South American grass thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions. It is drought-tolerant once established and needs minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant suitable for bright, open environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the growing season, especially in poorer soils.
