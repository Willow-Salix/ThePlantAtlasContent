## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This plant, native to the montane temperate regions of Mexico, thrives in full sun to partial shade with moderate, well-drained watering. It requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot and generally benefits from low to moderate fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or none if planted in rich soil.
