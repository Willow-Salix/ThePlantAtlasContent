## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and temperate Asia; naturalized in some other temperate coastal areas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Coastal Salt Marsh |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. This plant thrives in open, exposed environments with direct sunlight for most of the day, typical of marshlands. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil, often inundated by brackish or saltwater. Requires regular watering, preferably with slightly saline water, to mimic its natural estuarine habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Salicornia europaea, known as marsh samphire, common glasswort or just glasswort, is a halophytic annual dicot flowering plant. Other common names include pickle weed, saltwort, and chicken toe (due to the shape). It is a succulent plant with high water content, accounting for its slightly translucent look (the source of the name 'glasswort'). It is found near saline water in Europe and is edible both raw and cooked.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This halophyte requires full sun and consistently moist, saline conditions to thrive, mimicking its native salt marsh environment. Water regularly with slightly salty water, and provide minimal fertilization as it is adapted to specialized, often nutrient-limited, saline soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It is adapted to often nutrient-poor, saline soils; excessive fertilization with standard fertilizers can be detrimental without proper salinity levels.
