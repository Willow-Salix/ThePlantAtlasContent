## Care Guide
This epiphytic fern thrives in high humidity and indirect light, mimicking its native tropical forest understory. Provide consistent moisture to its well-draining substrate and ensure good air circulation. Fertilize very lightly during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. Use a very diluted liquid fertilizer (quarter strength) sparingly during the growing season.
