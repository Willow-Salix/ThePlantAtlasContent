## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (California and Oregon, USA) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Mediterranean (specifically vernal pool habitats) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (requires direct sunlight for robust growth and flowering) |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to inundated during active growth and bloom period (mimicking vernal pools filling with water), followed by a complete dry dormancy after flowering as the pools evaporate. |

## Introduction
Downingia is a genus of 13 annual plants native to western North America and Chile. Commonly known as calico flowers, they are notable for forming mass displays of small but colorful blooms around vernal pools. A number are uncommon endemics in California.
The stems may be decumbent or erect, 10–40 cm in length, with narrow cauline leaves that may drop off before the flower develops. The flowers are typically inverted by the twisting of the ovary during blooming. Colors range from blue and pink to white, with the lower (larger) lip including a white or yellow patch. The lower lip generally consists of three lobes, while the upper lip is much smaller and has two lobes.
The genus is named after American horticulturalist A. J. Downing (1815-1852).

## Care Guide
To care for the Folded Calicoflower, provide full sun and mimic its vernal pool habitat by keeping the soil consistently wet or even inundated during its active growth and flowering in spring. After its annual lifecycle concludes, allow the soil to dry out completely for a period of dry dormancy, requiring little to no supplemental fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; soils in vernal pools are typically not nutrient-rich. A very light, balanced liquid fertilizer may be applied during active growth if grown in sterile potting mix.
