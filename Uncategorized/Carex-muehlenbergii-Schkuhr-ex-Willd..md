## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (southeastern Canada, eastern and central United States, west to the Great Plains) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest, Temperate Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Its native habitats of open woodlands, prairies, and fields indicate it tolerates direct sun well. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the topsoil to dry out between waterings. Its 'dry to mesic' native conditions mean it tolerates drought once established but prefers consistent moisture during active growth. |

## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Muhlenberg's Sedge is a robust temperate plant native to open areas of North America, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering, tolerating dry spells once established, and generally needs minimal fertilization, adapting well to average soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a native sedge often found in varying soil conditions, it is not a heavy feeder. A light annual application of a balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil is very poor, otherwise often not needed.
