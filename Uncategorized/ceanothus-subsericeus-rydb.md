## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Coast of California, USA (specifically Monterey Bay area) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral/Coastal Scrub |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during the summer. Requires excellent drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ceanothus is a genus of about 50–60 species of nitrogen-fixing shrubs and small trees in the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae). Common names for members of this genus are buckbrush, California lilac, soap bush, or just ceanothus. "Ceanothus" comes from Ancient Greek: κεάνωθος (keánōthos), which was applied by Theophrastus (371–287 BC) to an Old World plant believed to be Cirsium arvense.
The genus is native to North America with the highest diversity on the western coast. Some species (e.g., C. americanus) are restricted to the eastern United States and southeast Canada, and others (e.g., C. caeruleus) extend as far south as Guatemala. Most are shrubs 0.5–3 metres (1.6–9.8 ft) tall, but C. arboreus and C. thyrsiflorus, both native to California, can be small multi-trunked trees up to 6–7 metres (20–23 ft) tall.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in its native Mediterranean chaparral climate, the Coast Ceanothus requires full sun and exceptionally well-draining soil. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and needs minimal watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum, avoiding high phosphorus products.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Ceanothus species are often nitrogen fixers and can be sensitive to high phosphorus fertilizers. Use only if growth is severely stunted, with a very low-phosphorus formula.
