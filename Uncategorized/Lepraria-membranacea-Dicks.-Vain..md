## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests, Boreal Forests (Taiga), specifically in cool, humid, and deeply shaded microclimates. |
| **Sunlight** | Extremely low light; prefers deep shade or diffused light. Direct sunlight is detrimental, often found in sheltered, north-facing locations or under dense tree canopies. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and regular moisture from mist, dew, or rain. Does not tolerate dry conditions and absorbs water directly from the atmosphere and substrate, not through roots. |

## Introduction
Lepraria is a genus of leprose (powdery) crustose lichens that grows on its substrate like patches of granular, caked up, mealy dust grains. Members of the genus are commonly called dust lichens. The main vegetative body (thallus) is made of patches of soredia (little balls of algae wrapped in fungus). There are no known mechanisms for sexual reproduction, yet members of the genus continue to speciate. Some species can form marginal lobes and appear squamulose. Because of the morphological simplicity of the thallus and the absence of sexual structures, the composition of lichen products (i.e., secondary metabolites made by lichens) are important characters to distinguish between similar species in Lepraria.

## Care Guide
Lepraria membranacea, a lichen, thrives in environments with extremely low light and consistently high humidity, mimicking its native habitat in deeply shaded forests. It requires no traditional watering or fertilization, as it absorbs all necessary moisture and nutrients directly from the air and its substrate.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens thrive in nutrient-poor environments; excess nutrients can be harmful.
