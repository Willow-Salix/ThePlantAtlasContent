## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Rocky Mountain region (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Montane Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, consistent with its adaptation to arid conditions and low rainfall. |

## Introduction
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, poor soil, mirroring its native semi-arid montane environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in poor, rocky, or sandy soils, so excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
