## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light. Prefers dappled sunlight or partial shade, mimicking its natural habitat beneath a tree canopy. Avoid direct, intense sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **💧 Water** | Frequent watering to keep the growing medium consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch or two to dry slightly between waterings, but do not let it dry out completely. High humidity is also crucial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Vanilla is a spice derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla, primarily obtained from pods of the flat-leaved vanilla (V. planifolia).
Vanilla is not autogamous, so pollination is required to make the plants produce the fruit from which the vanilla spice is obtained. In 1837, Belgian botanist Charles François Antoine Morren discovered this fact and pioneered a method of artificially pollinating the plant. The method proved financially unworkable and was not deployed commercially. In 1841, Edmond Albius, a 12-year-old slave who lived on the French island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean, discovered that the plant could be hand-pollinated. Hand-pollination allowed global cultivation of the plant. Noted French botanist and plant collector Jean Michel Claude Richard falsely claimed to have discovered the technique three or four years earlier. By the end of the 20th century, Albius was considered the true discoverer.
Three major species of vanilla currently are grown globally, all derived from a species originally found in Mesoamerica, including parts of modern-day Mexico. They are V. planifolia (syn. V. fragrans), grown on Madagascar, Réunion, and other tropical areas along the Indian Ocean; V. × tahitensis, grown in the South Pacific; and V. pompona, found in the West Indies, Central America, and South America. The majority of the world's vanilla is the V. planifolia species, more commonly known as Bourbon vanilla (after the former name of Réunion, Île Bourbon) or Madagascar vanilla, which is produced in Madagascar and neighboring islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean, and in Indonesia. Madagascar's and Indonesia's cultivations produce two-thirds of the world's supply of vanilla.
Measured by weight, vanilla is the world's second-most expensive spice after saffron, because growing the vanilla seed pods is labor-intensive. Nevertheless, vanilla is widely used in both commercial and domestic baking, perfume production, and aromatherapy, as only small amounts are needed to impart its signature flavor and aroma.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Vanilla planifolia thrives in conditions that mimic its tropical rainforest home, requiring bright, indirect light and consistently moist, but not waterlogged, conditions. High humidity is essential, and it benefits from regular, dilute feeding to support its epiphytic growth habit.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Regular feeding with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., half-strength every 2-4 weeks) during the growing season. As an epiphyte, it absorbs nutrients from rain and decaying organic matter, so a light hand is best.
