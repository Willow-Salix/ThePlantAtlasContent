## Introduction
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## Care Guide
Gholson's Blazing Star thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its native humid subtropical pine flatwood environment. It is a low-maintenance plant that requires minimal fertilization and tolerates some drought once established, making it a robust garden choice.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer. Thrives in average to poor soils and can become leggy with excessive nutrients. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring if growth is poor.
