## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in cool temperate and boreal regions of Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Alps) and North America, often in mountainous or exposed rocky areas. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate to Boreal, Montane/Alpine (characterized by distinct seasons, including cold winters and moderate summers, with periodic rainfall and snow). |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; this lichen naturally grows on exposed rock surfaces in open environments, requiring high light intensity. |
| **Watering** | Mimic natural rainfall patterns; requires periodic rehydration from rain or mist, followed by complete drying. Avoid constant dampness, but ensure occasional thorough wetting. |

## Introduction
Lobothallia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family  Megasporaceae.  Dark brown to black apothecia may be sunken into the surface of the thallus, as indicated in the common name puffed sunken-disk lichen. Originally described as a subgenus of Aspicilia in 1984, Lobothallia was elevated to full genus status in 1991 based on distinctive features including peripheral lobes and small, thin-walled ascospores. The genus was established to clarify a group of rock-dwelling lichens that had previously been classified across several different genera.
The genus is found across multiple continents including Eurasia, North America, and Australia, with the greatest diversity occurring in the semi-arid mountains of Central Asia. These lichens typically grow on exposed rock faces, from low-elevation steppes to high mountain areas above 2,600 meters, and are well-adapted to dry conditions. As of 2025, the genus includes 28 recognized species, with several new species recently discovered in Pakistan and China.

## Care Guide
Lobothallia praeradiosa, a saxicolous lichen, thrives in high light environments on exposed rocks, typical of cool temperate to boreal montane regions. It requires periodic moisture mimicking natural rainfall, followed by dry periods for optimal health, and needs no external fertilization.

### Fertilizer
None; as a lichen, it obtains nutrients directly from the air and its rocky substrate and is sensitive to external fertilizers.
