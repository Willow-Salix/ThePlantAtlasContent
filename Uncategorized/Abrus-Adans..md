## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions, primarily India, Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, and Northern Australia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Dry Forests, Scrublands, and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade, thriving in bright, direct light for several hours daily, consistent with its natural habitat in open areas or forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent watering during its active growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Tolerates drier conditions during dormant periods but needs well-drained soil to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Abrus is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, and the only genus in the tribe Abreae. It contains 13–18 species, but is best known for a single species: jequirity (A. precatorius). The highly toxic seeds of that species are used to make jewellery.
Species range naturally across tropical Africa, Madagascar, the Arabian Peninsula, south and southeast Asia, southern China, New Guinea, and Australia. Some species have been introduced to the tropical Americas.

## Care Guide
Abrus thrives in warm, tropical conditions with ample bright light to full sun. It requires regular watering during active growth, ensuring good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, only minimal fertilization is needed.

### Fertilizer
As a legume, Abrus species are nitrogen fixers and generally do not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, especially if soil nutrients are low.
