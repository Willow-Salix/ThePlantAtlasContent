## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Southern Europe |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Freshwater Wetlands (moist meadows, fens, water margins) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. It thrives in open, bright conditions but can tolerate some filtered light. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil. Its native habitat indicates a need for regular, ample watering, potentially tolerating boggy or shallowly inundated conditions. |

## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
The Barley-spike Sedge requires a temperate environment with consistently moist to wet soil, ideally placed in full sun to partial shade. Ensure ample watering to mimic its native wetland edges and provide moderate fertilization to support its growth in average soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Thrives in average to moderately fertile soils. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring should suffice.
