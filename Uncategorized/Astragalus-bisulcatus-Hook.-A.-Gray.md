| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Semi-arid Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its native open grassland habitat where it receives unobstructed light. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native temperate grasslands. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between waterings, as it is drought-tolerant once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, fertilizer needs are very low.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume. If needed, a very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly, but typically no additional nitrogen is required.
