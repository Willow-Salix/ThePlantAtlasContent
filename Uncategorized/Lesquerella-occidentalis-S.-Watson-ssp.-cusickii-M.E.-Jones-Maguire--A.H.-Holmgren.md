## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically the Intermountain West of the United States, including Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Montane Dryland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its native open, high-exposure habitats. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to arid conditions. |

## Introduction
Lesquerella is the former name of a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Recent work has shown that Lesquerella is indistinct from the genus Physaria and both genera have been united under Physaria. In addition, the former Lesquerella of the southeastern United States have been moved to the genus Paysonia since 2002. The genus Lesquerella is now no longer applied to any species and is considered defunct.
The genus is named in honor of Leo Lesquereux, 1805–1889, Swiss and American botanist.

## Care Guide
Cusick's Bladderpod is a low-maintenance plant that requires full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its arid scrubland origins. Water very sparingly, only when the soil is completely dry, and avoid fertilization to prevent overgrowth and stress.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in lean, rocky, nutrient-poor soils and does not require regular fertilization.
