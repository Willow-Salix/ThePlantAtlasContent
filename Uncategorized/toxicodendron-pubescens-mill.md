## 🌱 Overview
Toxicodendron (from Ancient Greek τοξικός (toxikós), meaning "poison", and δένδρον (déndron), meaning "tree") is a genus of flowering plants in the sumac family, Anacardiaceae. It contains trees, shrubs and woody vines, including poison ivy, poison oak, and the lacquer tree. The best-known members of the genus in North America are eastern poison ivy (T. radicans) and western poison oak (T. diversilobum), both ubiquitous throughout much of their respective region.
All members of the genus produce the skin-irritating oil urushiol, which can cause a severe allergic reaction known as urushiol-induced contact dermatitis. The resins of certain species native to Japan, China and other Asian countries, such as lacquer tree (T. vernicifluum) and wax tree (T. succedaneum), are used to make lacquer, and, as a byproduct of lacquer manufacture, their berries are used to make japan wax.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Atlantic poison oak is a robust native plant thriving in temperate forest edges and open woodlands of the southeastern US. It prefers partial to full sun and moist, well-drained soil, tolerating some drought once established. Minimal to no fertilization is needed due to its adaptation to natural nutrient cycles.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally does not require fertilization. Thrives in average, unamended soil, as it is adapted to nutrient cycles of native temperate woodlands.
