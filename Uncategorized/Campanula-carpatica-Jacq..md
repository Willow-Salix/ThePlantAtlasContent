## Care Guide
Tussock Bellflower thrives in locations with full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native subalpine meadow environment. It requires moderate watering and minimal fertilization, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant once established, especially in rocky or alpine garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in early spring or a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks during the blooming period is generally sufficient. Avoid over-fertilizing.
