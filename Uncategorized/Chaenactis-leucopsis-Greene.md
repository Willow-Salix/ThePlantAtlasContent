## Introduction
Chaenactis is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae which are known generally as pincushions and dustymaidens.
These wildflowers are native to western North America, especially the desert southwest of the United States. They are quite variable in appearance. They are generally aster-like in appearance with many disc florets in each head. There may be only disc florets, but sometimes there are also enlarged ray florets along the edges of the corolla. They may be white to yellow or pink.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland environment, requiring full sun and excellent drainage. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization as it prefers lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; thrives in lean, poor soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
