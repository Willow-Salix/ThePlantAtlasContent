## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect to full sun exposure, typical of open rocky habitats. While it can tolerate exposure, it benefits from protection against extreme heat and prolonged intense sun without moisture. |
| **Watering** | Requires periodic rehydration from rainfall, dew, or humidity, especially during cooler, wetter periods. It can tolerate extended dry periods by entering dormancy but benefits from occasional misting or light watering to rehydrate in cultivation. |

## Introduction
Placynthium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Placynthiaceae. Members of this genus are commonly called blackthread lichens.

## Care Guide
As a lichen native to Mediterranean California, Placynthium microphyllizum thrives in bright, open conditions on calcareous rock or similar substrates. It requires regular rehydration from atmospheric moisture or misting, especially during dry seasons, but is adapted to tolerate periods of desiccation. Traditional fertilizers should be entirely avoided, as they are harmful to this organism.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens acquire nutrients directly from the environment (air, rainwater, substrate) and are highly sensitive to external fertilizers, which can be detrimental to their growth.
