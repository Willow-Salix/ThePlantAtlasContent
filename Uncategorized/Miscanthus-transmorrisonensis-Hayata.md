## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Taiwan (endemic, mountainous regions) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Montane Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistent moisture but is tolerant of some drought once established; ensure excellent drainage and avoid waterlogging. Water when the top inch or two of soil feels dry. |

## Introduction
Miscanthus, or silvergrass, is a genus of African, Eurasian, and Pacific Island plants in the grass family, Poaceae. The name is derived from the Greek words "miskos", meaning "stem", and "anthos", meaning "flower", in reference to the stalked spikelets on plants of this genus. Several species are known for their height and biomass production, and may be used as ornamental grasses.

## Care Guide
This Taiwanese silvergrass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native montane grassland habitat. It requires consistent moisture but tolerates some drought, making good drainage crucial to prevent root rot. Feed sparingly in spring for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced granular fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if planted in rich soil.
