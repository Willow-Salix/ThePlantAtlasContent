| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in environments with ample light exposure, tolerating some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |

## Introduction
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## Care Guide
This resilient native plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly drought-tolerant once established. It requires minimal watering, preferring soil to dry out between applications. Fertilization is rarely needed, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny garden spots.

### Fertilizer
Low. Native to often lean soils, this plant generally does not require frequent fertilization. If soil is extremely poor, a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
