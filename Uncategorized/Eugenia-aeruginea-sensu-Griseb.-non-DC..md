## Introduction
Eugenia is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family Myrtaceae. It has a worldwide, although highly uneven, distribution in tropical and subtropical regions. The bulk of the approximately 1,100 species occur in the New World tropics, especially in the eastern Brazil's northern Andes, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Forest (coastal forests). Other centers of diversity include New Caledonia and Madagascar. Many species in the Old World have received a new classification into the genus Syzygium.
All species are woody evergreen trees and shrubs. Several are grown as ornamental plants for their attractive glossy foliage, and a few produce edible fruit that are eaten fresh or used in jams and jellies.

## Care Guide
This plant is well-suited for warm, subtropical to tropical environments, preferring full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. It is notably drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering and minimal fertilization to thrive and maintain its robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in spring is typically sufficient, or light liquid feeding every few months during the growing season.
