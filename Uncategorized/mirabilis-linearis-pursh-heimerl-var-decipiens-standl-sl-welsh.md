## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant, native to the arid scrublands and deserts of the southwestern United States, thrives in full sun conditions. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering once its soil has thoroughly dried. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native to lean soils, it thrives without rich nutrients. If fertilized, use a very light hand and only during active growth.
