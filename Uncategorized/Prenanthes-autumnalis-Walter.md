## Introduction
Prenanthes is a genus of plant in the family Asteraceae, often referred to as rattlesnake root.
Molecular analysis in 2009 revealed that the genus as traditionally envisioned was polyphyletic, meaning that it is a conglomeration of species not closely related to one another. The genus formerly included species now placed in Aetheorhiza, Askellia, Brickellia, Chondrilla, Crepidiastrum, Crepis, Emilia, Erythroseris, Faberia, Hololeion, Hypochaeris, Ixeris, Lactuca, Lapsanastrum, Launaea, Lygodesmia, Nabalus, Notoseris, Paraprenanthes, Parasenecio, Picrosia, Sonchella, Sonchus, Soroseris, Stephanomeria, Trixis, and Youngia.

## Care Guide
To mimic its native humid subtropical woodland environment, Slender Rattlesnakeroot thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. It requires regular watering, especially during dry spells, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs, making it relatively low-maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of balanced fertilizer once a year in spring or no fertilizer if soil is naturally rich
