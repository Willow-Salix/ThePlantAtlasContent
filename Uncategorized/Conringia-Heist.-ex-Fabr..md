## Care Guide
Hare's Ear Mustard is a robust plant that thrives in full sun exposure. It is drought-tolerant and prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. Minimal fertilization is typically required, reflecting its adaptability to various soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a plant often found in disturbed or fallow lands, it typically does not require rich soil or heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced fertilizer in spring may suffice, or none at all if soil is reasonably fertile.
