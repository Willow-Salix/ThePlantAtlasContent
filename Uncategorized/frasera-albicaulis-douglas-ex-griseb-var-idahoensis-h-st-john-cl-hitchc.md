## 🧤 Care Instructions
Idaho frasera requires full sun to partial sun exposure and well-drained soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between applications, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor montane soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; plants from such environments are typically adapted to lean soils and do not require heavy fertilization.
