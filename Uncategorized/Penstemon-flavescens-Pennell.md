## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mountainous regions of Western North America (primarily California, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah) |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, high-altitude native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Prefers well-drained conditions characteristic of mountain slopes, tolerating some drought once established. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This penstemon thrives in conditions mimicking its native high mountain home. Ensure it receives abundant full sun and is planted in very well-drained soil. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low; generally not required in average garden soil as it's adapted to lean, rocky soils. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
