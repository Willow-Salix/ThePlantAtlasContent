## Care Guide
Bulb Panicgrass thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native open montane grasslands. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between applications, and benefits from light to moderate feeding during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring/summer). Over-fertilization is generally not necessary given its natural habitat.
