## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic regions, including northern Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Scandinavia, and Siberia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to mimic its open, treeless native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. It tolerates moist but not waterlogged conditions, adapting to meltwater from snow and permafrost in its native environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chrysanthemums ( kriss-AN-thə-məmz), sometimes abbreviated to 'mums' or 'chrysanths', are perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the family Asteraceae that bloom in the autumn.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Arctic Daisy thrives in full sun, reflecting its exposed tundra origins. It requires moderate, consistent moisture with excellent drainage, preferring lean soils with minimal fertilization. The overall care strategy should emulate cool, open, and nutrient-poor conditions to ensure its success.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Tundra soils are typically lean and nutrient-poor, so minimal or no fertilization is required, especially in average garden soils.
