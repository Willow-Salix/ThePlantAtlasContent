## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, tolerating long dry periods. Given its nitrogen-fixing ability, fertilizer needs are very low to non-existent, preferring poor, well-draining soils typical of its arid native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Very low. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers; it thrives in nutrient-poor, well-draining soils.
