## Introduction
Candelina submexicana is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling) crustose lichen in the family Candelariaceae. This small lichen forms yellow patches that hug tightly to rock surfaces, with flattened lobes radiating outward from the center. It is closely related to Candelina mexicana but can be distinguished by its smaller size, more reddish-yellow color, and different internal structure. The species grows in sunny, dry locations across Mexico, the southwestern United States, and Peru, typically on exposed non-limestone rocks.

## Care Guide
This resilient lichen thrives in dry, sunny environments typical of arid regions. It requires minimal moisture, absorbing it from infrequent rain or atmospheric humidity, and does not need supplemental fertilization, obtaining nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none, as lichens absorb nutrients primarily from the air and precipitation rather than a substrate like soil.
