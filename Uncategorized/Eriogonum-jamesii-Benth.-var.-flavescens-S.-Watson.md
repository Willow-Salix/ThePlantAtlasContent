## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Wyoming) |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Grassland and Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open native habitat on plains and dry slopes. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering should be avoided. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native arid plains and foothills. Mimic its natural environment by providing ample sunlight and watering sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between applications, and avoid excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; typically no fertilizer is required, as it thrives in lean soils. If growth is poor, a very light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be used sparingly.
