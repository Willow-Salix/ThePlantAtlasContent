| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, specifically Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Maine, and extending south to New England in the USA. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Freshwater Aquatic |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to bright indirect light, tolerating full sun when submerged in clear, shallow water. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant submersion in clean, fresh, shallow water to mimic its natural aquatic habitat. |

## Introduction
Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of lycopod. It is the only living genus in the family Isoetaceae and order Isoetales. As of 2016, there were about 200 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution mostly in aquatic habitats but with the individual species often scarce to rare. Species virtually identical to modern quillworts have existed since the Jurassic epoch, though the timing of the origin of modern Isoetes is subject to considerable uncertainty.
The name of the genus may also be spelled Isoëtes. The diaeresis (two dots over the e) indicates that the o and the e are to be pronounced in two distinct syllables. Including this in print is optional; either spelling (Isoetes or Isoëtes) is correct.

## Care Guide
The Acadian quillwort thrives in cool, shallow, and acidic freshwater environments found in temperate Eastern North America. It requires consistent submersion in clean water and can tolerate moderate to bright indirect light, even full sun. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, fertilization should be minimal to non-existent.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) conditions; avoid heavy fertilization.
