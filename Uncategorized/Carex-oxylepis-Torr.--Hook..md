## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Sharpscale Sedge thrives in consistently wet, rich soils and prefers partial to full shade, mimicking its native habitat in humid subtropical wetlands. Ensure the soil never dries out and provide regular nutrients to support vigorous growth. It is an excellent choice for damp, shaded garden areas or bog gardens.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high fertility; benefits from rich, organic soils, suggesting regular fertilization with a balanced, slow-release or organic fertilizer.
