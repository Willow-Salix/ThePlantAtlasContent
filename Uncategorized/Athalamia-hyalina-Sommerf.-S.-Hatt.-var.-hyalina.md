## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal and Circumarctic regions, including alpine and subalpine areas of North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Boreal Forest, Arctic regions |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light; avoids direct, intense sunlight, preferring shaded or partly shaded locations. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist (but not waterlogged) substrate and high ambient humidity; frequent misting or a terrarium environment is beneficial. |

## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in cool, highly humid environments with consistently moist substrate and low to moderate indirect light. Avoid direct sun and over-fertilizing, as it prefers minimal nutrients and high moisture levels to replicate its native alpine and arctic habitats.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none; bryophytes generally have minimal nutrient needs, and excessive fertilizer can be harmful.
