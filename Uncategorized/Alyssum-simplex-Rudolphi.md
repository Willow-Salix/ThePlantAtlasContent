## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia, particularly the Mediterranean basin. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, reflecting its natural habitat in open, exposed areas with high light intensity. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is adapted to periods of summer drought and dislikes consistently wet soil. |

## Introduction
Alyssum is a genus of over a hundred species of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, native to temperate Europe, Asia, and northern Africa, with the highest species diversity in the Mediterranean region. The genus comprises annual and perennial herbaceous plants or (rarely) small shrubs, growing to 10–100 cm tall, with oblong-oval leaves. Alyssum flowers are characteristically small and grouped in terminal clusters; they are often yellow or white colored but can be pink or purple.
The genera Lobularia, Aurinia and Odontarrhena are closely related to Alyssum and were formerly included in it. The widely cultivated species popularly known as "sweet alyssum" (Alyssum maritimum) is Lobularia maritima. The common rockery plant (Alyssum saxatile) is Aurinia saxatilis.
Alyssum foliage is used as food by the caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera, including the Gem (Orthonama obstipata). However, rabbits will not eat it.

## Care Guide
Alyssum simplex thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering once established. It prefers well-draining soil and typically needs minimal fertilization, reflecting its origins in Mediterranean climates with often poor, rocky soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring may be beneficial if grown in very poor soil, but it generally thrives without heavy nutrient supplementation, consistent with its native rocky habitats.
