## Introduction
Cephalaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae. It includes 102 species native to southern Europe, western and central Asia, and northern and southern Africa.
They are annual or perennial herbaceous plants growing to 0.8–2 m tall.
Cephalaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia imperialis, which feeds exclusively on C. procera.

## Care Guide
Cephalaria flourishes in sunny, open locations with well-drained soil, reflecting its native temperate and Mediterranean habitats. It requires moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry between applications, and tolerates drought once established. Fertilizer needs are minimal, contributing to its low-maintenance appeal.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, or none if planted in reasonably fertile soil.
