## Care Guide
Rusby's Fleabane prefers full to partial sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native montane semi-arid habitat. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between sessions, and provide minimal fertilization. This plant is well-suited for xeriscaping or rock gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low; it typically thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring, or none at all, is usually sufficient.
