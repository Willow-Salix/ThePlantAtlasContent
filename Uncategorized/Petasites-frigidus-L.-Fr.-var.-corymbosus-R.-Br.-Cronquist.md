## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Subarctic regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Greenland) and Eurasia (e.g., Siberia, Northern Europe) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Subarctic Wetlands, Boreal Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring cooler temperatures and often found in open areas with consistent light. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimic its native boggy or stream-side habitats by ensuring the soil never dries out completely. |

## Introduction
Petasites frigidus, the Arctic sweet coltsfoot or Arctic butterbur, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Arctic to cool temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in northern Europe, northern Asia and northern North America.
It is a herbaceous perennial plant producing flowering stems in early spring, and large leaves through the summer. The upright flowering stems are 10–20 cm (4–8 in) tall, and bear only 5–12 inflorescences, yellowish-white to pink in colour. The leaves are rounded, 15–20 cm (6–8 in) broad, with a deeply cleft base and shallowly lobed margin, and rise directly from the underground rootstock. The underside of the leaves is covered with matted, woolly fuzz. It grows in moist shaded ground, preferring stream banks and seeping ground of cut-banks.

While there is some disagreement, some sources identify five varieties of P. frigidus:

Petasites frigidus var. frigidus
Petasites frigidus var. nivalis, sometimes referred to as P. nivalis or P. hyperboreus. This variety is common at subalpine and alpine elevations.
Petasites frigidus var. palmatus, sometimes referred to as P. palmatus, palmate coltsfoot, or western coltsfoot; mâl-ē-mē’ (Konkow language); or tä-tä-tē’; pē’-wē is the root.
Petasites frigidus var. sagittatus, arrowleaf sweet coltsfoot.
Petasites frigidus var. vitifolius

## Care Guide
This arctic species thrives in cool, moist conditions reminiscent of its native tundra and wetland habitats. Provide consistent moisture and good drainage, along with full sun to partial shade in a cool environment. Fertilize sparingly, as it is adapted to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; adapted to nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
