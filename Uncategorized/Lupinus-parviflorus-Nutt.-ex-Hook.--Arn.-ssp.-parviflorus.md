## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Lodgepole Lupine thrives in full sun and moderate moisture, typical of its native temperate montane habitats. It prefers lean, well-drained soils and requires little to no fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it a low-maintenance choice for appropriate climates.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers which can inhibit flowering. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils.
