## Introduction
Hypericum  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Hypericaceae (formerly considered a subfamily of Clusiaceae).  The genus has a nearly worldwide distribution, missing only from tropical lowlands, deserts and polar regions. Many Hypericum species are regarded as invasive species and noxious weeds.  All members of the genus may be referred to as St. John's wort, and some are known as goatweed. The white or pink flowered marsh St. John's worts of North America and eastern Asia are generally accepted as belonging to the separate genus Triadenum Raf.
Hypericum is unusual for a genus of its size because a worldwide taxonomic monograph was produced for it by Norman Robson (working at the Natural History Museum, London). Robson recognizes 36 sections within Hypericum.

## Care Guide
This wetland native thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently wet soil, reflecting its natural habitat in bogs and marshes. It requires low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-average environments and sensitive to over-feeding.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to average to poor soil fertility and may be sensitive to excessive nutrients.
