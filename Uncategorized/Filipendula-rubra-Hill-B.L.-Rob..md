## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central United States |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grasslands / Moist Prairies |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for best flowering but can tolerate some afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Regular and consistent watering to maintain moist, but not waterlogged, soil. Its native habitat in moist prairies and stream banks indicates a high need for consistent moisture. |

## Introduction
Filipendula is a genus of 12 species of perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the family Rosaceae, native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Well-known species include meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and dropwort (Filipendula vulgaris), both native to Europe, and queen-of-the-forest (Filipendula occidentalis) and queen-of-the-prairie (Filipendula rubra), native to North America.
The species grow to between 0.5–2 m tall, with large inflorescences of small five-petalled flowers, creamy-white to pink-tinged in most species, dark pink in F. rubra. Filipendula fruit are unusual, sometimes described as an indehiscent follicle, or as an achene.
Filipendula species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species: emperor moth, grey pug, grizzled skipper, Hebrew character, lime-speck pug, mottled beauty and the satellite have all been recorded on meadowsweet.
The species were in the past sometimes treated in a broad view of the genus Spiraea, but genetic research has shown that they are less closely related than previously considered.
The genus name Filipendula derives from the Latin words filum "thread" and pendulus "hanging", referring to the tubers of F. vulgaris, which are attached to one other by thread-like roots.

## Care Guide
To care for Queen of the Prairie, provide full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil remains consistently moist, reflecting its native habitat along stream banks and moist prairies. This plant thrives with regular watering and benefits from minimal fertilization, such as an annual compost application to enrich the soil.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is needed, as it naturally thrives in rich, moist soils. An annual application of compost or a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if the soil is poor.
