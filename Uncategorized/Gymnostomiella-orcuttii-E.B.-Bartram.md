| **Watering** | Allow the surface of the substrate to dry slightly between waterings, then thoroughly moisten. Benefits from high ambient humidity or occasional misting. |

## Care Guide
This rare moss thrives in conditions mimicking its arid coastal native habitat. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and allow the substrate to dry slightly between thorough waterings. It prefers alkaline conditions and requires minimal fertilization, benefiting from occasional humidity.

### Fertilizer
Very minimal to no fertilization. If used, apply a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once or twice a year). Prefers calcareous (alkaline) conditions.
