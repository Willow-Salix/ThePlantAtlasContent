## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Macaronesian islands (e.g., Canary Islands, Madeira, Azores), coastal Western Europe (Portugal, Spain), and Northwest Africa (Morocco). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Oceanic Coastal / Mediterranean Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure, often found on exposed rocks in its native habitat, but can tolerate some periods of bright indirect light. |
| **💧 Water** | Primarily relies on atmospheric moisture from high humidity, fog, and occasional rainfall. It is highly desiccation-tolerant, entering dormancy during dry periods. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fruticose lichen thrives in coastal environments on exposed siliceous rocks, requiring high sun and moisture from ambient humidity, fog, or rain. It is highly desiccation-tolerant, entering dormancy in dry periods. Traditional watering or fertilization is not applicable, as it obtains nutrients from the atmosphere and is sensitive to air pollution, emphasizing the need for clean air.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rainwater) and are sensitive to air pollution.
