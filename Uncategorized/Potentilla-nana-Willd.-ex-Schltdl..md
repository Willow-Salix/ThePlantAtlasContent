## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Greenland), Eurasia (e.g., Russia, Fennoscandia), Iceland, Svalbard. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra, Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, ideally receiving at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking the long daylight hours of its native polar summers. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist but very well-drained soil, especially during the short growing season. Avoid waterlogging, as standing water can be detrimental, despite its preference for moist conditions from snowmelt. |

## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
Arctic Cinquefoil thrives in cold, exposed conditions with full sun. It needs consistently moist yet very well-drained soil, mimicking its tundra origins where meltwater is present but not stagnant. Fertilization is generally unnecessary due to its adaptation to lean, nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental. If needed, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year in spring.
