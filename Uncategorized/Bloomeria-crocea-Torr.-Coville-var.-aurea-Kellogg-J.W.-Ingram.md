## Care Guide
Common Goldenstar flourishes in conditions similar to its native Mediterranean climate, requiring full sun to partial shade. It needs moderate watering during its spring growth and bloom, followed by a dry period through its summer dormancy to prevent rot. Plant in well-draining soil and fertilize sparingly.

### Fertilizer
Low. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly in early spring, but it often thrives without extensive fertilization in good soil.
