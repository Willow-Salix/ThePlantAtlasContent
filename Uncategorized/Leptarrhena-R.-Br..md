## Care Guide
Leptarrhena flourishes in cool, consistently moist environments characteristic of its native subalpine and alpine wet meadows. Provide full sun to partial shade, ensuring the soil never dries out, mimicking its boggy natural habitat. Fertilize minimally during active growth to support its modest nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, slow-release formula once or twice during the growing season.
