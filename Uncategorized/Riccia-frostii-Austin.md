## Care Guide
This aquatic liverwort thrives in consistently moist to submerged conditions with moderate light. While tolerant of short dry spells, it requires regular water to flourish. Fertilization should be minimal, if any, to avoid nutrient excess.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as high nutrient levels can be harmful. Nutrients are typically absorbed from the water or substrate.
