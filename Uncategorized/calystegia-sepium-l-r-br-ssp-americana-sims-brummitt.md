| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate (found in grasslands, open woodlands, and disturbed areas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; it thrives with ample light exposure in open or semi-open habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to regular watering; prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil, reflecting typical temperate rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Calystegia (bindweed, false bindweed, or morning glory) is a genus of about 25 species of flowering plants in the bindweed family Convolvulaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution in temperate and subtropical regions, but with half of the species endemic to California.  They are annual or herbaceous perennial twining vines growing 1–5 m tall, with spirally arranged leaves. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, 3–10 cm diameter, white or pink, with (in most species) a sometimes inflated basal epicalyx.
The genus bears much similarity to a related genus Convolvulus, and is sometimes combined with it; it is distinguished primarily by the pollen being smooth, and in the ovary being unilocular.
Some of the species, notably Calystegia sepium and C. silvatica, are problematic weeds, which can swamp other more valuable plants by climbing over them, but some are also deliberately grown for their attractive flowers.
Calystegia species are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Bedellia somnulentella (recorded on C. sepium) and small angle shades.
The name is derived from two Greek words κάλυξ (kálux) "cup", and στέγη (stégē) "a covering", meaning "covering cup", this refers to the large bracts that cover the sepals.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable North American native thrives in temperate climates with full sun to partial shade. Provide moderate, consistent moisture and expect it to grow vigorously even in average soil conditions, requiring minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; as a robust and often weedy plant, it does not require rich soil and can thrive in average conditions.
