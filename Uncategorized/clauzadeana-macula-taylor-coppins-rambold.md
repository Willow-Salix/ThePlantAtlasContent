## 🧤 Care Instructions
Clauzadeana macula is an alpine crustose lichen that thrives on exposed rocks in high-altitude environments. It requires significant light exposure and depends entirely on natural precipitation and high atmospheric humidity for its moisture needs, enduring periodic dry spells. No fertilization is needed, as typical plant fertilizers are harmful to lichens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. This lichen obtains all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere and the mineral substrate; conventional fertilizers are detrimental and should be avoided.
