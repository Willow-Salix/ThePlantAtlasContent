## Care Guide
Cyrtandra leucocalyx requires conditions similar to its native Hawaiian rainforest environment. Provide consistent moisture, high humidity, and bright, indirect light, while avoiding direct sun. Moderate feeding during its active growth period will support its health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer is suitable, mimicking the nutrient-rich organic matter found in its native forest soil.
