## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Palau (Micronesia) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; thrives in dappled shade conditions typical of a forest understory. Direct sun should be avoided. |
| **Watering** | Keep the potting medium consistently moist but not waterlogged, allowing the very top layer to dry slightly between waterings. High humidity is essential, reflecting its rainforest habitat. |

## Introduction
Zeuxine, commonly known as verdant jewel orchids, is a genus of about eighty species of orchids in the tribe Cranichideae. They are native to parts of tropical Africa, Asia, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, Australia and some Pacific Islands. They have relatively narrow, dark green leaves and small, dull-coloured resupinate flowers with the dorsal sepal and petals overlapping to form a hood over the column. The labellum has a pouched base and its tip has two lobes.

## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid requires conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest floor: low to medium indirect light and consistently moist but well-drained medium. High humidity is critical for its health. Fertilize sparingly during its growing season with a diluted orchid fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding during active growth with a balanced orchid fertilizer, perhaps at half strength, to mimic the nutrient availability from decaying organic matter on the forest floor.
