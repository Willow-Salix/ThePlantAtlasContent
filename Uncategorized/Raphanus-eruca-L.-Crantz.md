## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin (Southern Europe, North Africa, Western Asia) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours direct sun) to partial shade (especially in hot climates to prevent premature bolting). |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent watering; allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, but ensure it doesn't dry out completely, particularly during active growth. |

## Introduction
Rocket, eruca, or arugula (Eruca sativa) is an edible annual plant in the family Brassicaceae used as a leaf vegetable for its fresh, tart, bitter, and peppery flavour. Its other common names include salad rocket and garden rocket (in the UK, Australia, South Africa, Ireland, and New Zealand), as well as colewort, roquette, ruchetta, rucola, rucoli, and rugula. Native to the Mediterranean region, it is widely popular as a salad vegetable.
Some botanists consider it a subspecies of Eruca vesicaria. However, they are different in many morphological aspects, such as sepal persistence, silique shape, and habit. Most importantly, they do not hybridise freely with each other as there is partial reproductive isolation between them. The Plants of the World Online database has accepted Eruca sativa as a distinct species.

## Care Guide
Arugula thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide moderate fertility for lush leaf production, and maintain regular watering to prevent premature bolting, especially in warmer conditions.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from fertile, well-draining soil. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied periodically during the growing season.
