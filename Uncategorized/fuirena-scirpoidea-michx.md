Fuirena, called umbrella sedges or umbrella grasses, are a genus of flowering plants in the sedge family (Cyperaceae), with a worldwide distribution, chiefly in the tropics and temperate zones. They are named for Danish physician and early botanist Georg Fuiren (Jorgen Furenius), 1581–1628.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wetland sedge, native to the southeastern US, requires consistently saturated soil and enjoys bright direct to partial sun exposure. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor bog environments, it benefits from very minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization needed; if grown in very poor soils, a dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season is sufficient, as it's adapted to nutrient-poor environments.
