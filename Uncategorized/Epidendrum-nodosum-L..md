## Introduction
Epidendrum , abbreviated Epi in the horticultural trade, is a large neotropical genus of the orchid family. With more than 1,500 species,  some authors describe it as a mega-genus. The genus name (from Greek επί, epi and δένδρον, dendron, "upon trees") refers to its epiphytic growth habit.
When Carl Linnaeus named this genus in 1763, he included in this genus all the epiphytic orchids known to him. Although few of these orchids are still included in the genus Epidendrum, some species of Epidendrum are nevertheless not epiphytic.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and high humidity, mirroring its tropical and subtropical native environments. Water consistently during active growth, ensuring good drainage, and feed lightly with a dilute orchid fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Apply a balanced orchid fertilizer at half to quarter strength every 2-4 weeks during active growth.
