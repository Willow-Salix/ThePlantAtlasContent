## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Boreal and temperate regions across North America, Europe, and Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade, typically found on tree bark or rocks in open woodlands. Avoid harsh, direct sun exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies on high ambient humidity, fog, dew, and occasional rainfall for moisture absorption. Requires good air circulation to dry out between wetting periods, as it does not have roots to absorb water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Melanelia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. These lichens typically grow on rocks and form relatively large, leaf-like structures with brown to blackish upper surfaces and pale undersides. The genus originally included many more species, but most have since been moved to related genera like Melanohalea and Melanelixia, leaving only five accepted species today.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Melanelia glabroides is an epiphytic lichen thriving in high humidity, bright indirect light, and excellent air circulation, typical of its native temperate and boreal forest environments. It obtains all necessary moisture and nutrients from the atmosphere and rainfall, requiring no traditional watering or fertilization, and is sensitive to pollutants.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens absorb trace nutrients directly from the atmosphere and rainfall and are highly sensitive to chemical fertilizers and pollutants.
