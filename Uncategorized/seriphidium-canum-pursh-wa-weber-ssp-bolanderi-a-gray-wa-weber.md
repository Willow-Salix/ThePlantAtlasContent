## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (California, Nevada, Oregon) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Montane Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun, at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Very drought-tolerant; water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Artemisia ( art-ə-MEE-zee-ə) is a large, diverse genus of plants belonging to the daisy family, Asteraceae, with almost 500 species. Common names for various species in the genus include mugwort, wormwood, and sagebrush.
Some botanists split the genus into several genera, but DNA analysis does not support the maintenance of the genera Crossostephium, Filifolium, Neopallasia, Seriphidium, and Sphaeromeria; three other segregate genera—Stilnolepis, Elachanthemum, and Kaschgaria—are maintained by this evidence. Occasionally, some of the species are called sages, causing confusion with the Salvia sages in the family Lamiaceae.
Artemisia comprises hardy herbaceous plants and shrubs, which are known for the powerful chemical constituents in their essential oils. Artemisia species grow in temperate climates of both hemispheres, usually in dry or semiarid habitats. Notable species include A. vulgaris (common mugwort), A. tridentata (big sagebrush), A. annua (sagewort), A. absinthium (wormwood), A. dracunculus (tarragon), and A. abrotanum (southernwood), and A. herba-alba (white wormwood). The leaves of many species are covered with white hairs.
Most species have strong aromas and bitter tastes from terpenoids and sesquiterpene lactones, which discourage herbivory, and may have had a selective advantage. The small flowers are wind-pollinated. Artemisia species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and dry conditions, indicative of its arid and montane native climate. It is extremely drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering, along with lean soil and very little, if any, fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; can thrive in poor to lean soils. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial but is often unnecessary.
