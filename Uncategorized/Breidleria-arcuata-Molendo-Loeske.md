## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss requires a consistently wet environment, mimicking its native boggy habitats. Provide cool temperatures and bright, indirect light, ensuring high humidity to prevent drying. Avoid any fertilization, as it can harm this low-nutrient adapted species.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs; over-fertilization can be detrimental. Fertilization is rarely, if ever, required.
