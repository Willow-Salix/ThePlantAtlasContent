## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including British Columbia (Canada), and the US states of Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, and Montana. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Coniferous Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Deep shade; as a mycoheterotroph, it does not photosynthesize and relies entirely on its fungal hosts, thriving in the low light of the forest understory. |
| **Watering** | Relies on the consistently moist, well-drained conditions found on the forest floor of its native habitat; direct watering for cultivation is not applicable as it cannot be grown outside its natural ecosystem. |

## Introduction
Allotropa virgata is in the family Ericaceae and is the only species of the genus Allotropa. It is a perennial plant that gets its common names from the distinct white and red or maroon stripes along its erect peduncle. It is a non-green plant, as it lacks chlorophyll, instead obtaining nutrition from neighboring green plants through a fungal intermediate.
Its common names include sugarstick, candystriped allotropa and barber's pole.

## Care Guide
The Sugarstick is an obligate mycoheterotroph and cannot be cultivated or grown in a typical garden setting due to its complete dependence on specific fungal hosts and associated coniferous trees. Its survival is tied to the cool, moist, and deeply shaded conditions of its native temperate montane coniferous forest ecosystem. Conservation of its natural habitat is crucial as successful cultivation is not feasible.

### Fertilizer
None; Allotropa virgata obtains all necessary nutrients by parasitizing specific fungi, which are mycorrhizal with host trees, making traditional fertilization irrelevant and potentially harmful.
