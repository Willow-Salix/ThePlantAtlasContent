## Introduction
Geranium is a genus of 422 species of annual, biennial, and perennial plants that are commonly known as geraniums or cranesbills. They are found throughout the temperate regions of the world and the mountains of the tropics, with the greatest diversity in the eastern part of the Mediterranean region.
The palmately cleft leaves are broadly circular in form. The flowers have five petals and are coloured white, pink, purple, or blue, often with distinctive veining. Geraniums will grow in any soil as long as it is not waterlogged. Propagation is by semiripe cuttings in summer, by seed, or by division in autumn or spring.
Geraniums are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, ghost moth, and mouse moth. At least several species of Geranium are gynodioecious. The species Geranium viscosissimum (sticky geranium) is considered to be protocarnivorous.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian Geranium variety thrives in cool, bright conditions with good air circulation. Ensure consistent soil moisture and well-draining soil, avoiding waterlogging. Light fertilization during growth will support its health.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. Use a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer once a month during the active growing season.
