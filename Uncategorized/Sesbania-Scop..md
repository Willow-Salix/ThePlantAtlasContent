## Introduction
Sesbania is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, and the only genus found in tribe Sesbanieae. Riverhemp is a common name for plants in this genus. Notable species include the rattlebox (Sesbania punicea), spiny sesbania (Sesbania bispinosa), and Sesbania sesban, which is used in cooking. Plants of this genus, some of which are aquatic, can be used in alley cropping to increase the soil's nitrogen content. The species of rhizobia responsible for nitrogen fixation in Sesbania rostrata is Azorhizobium caulinodans.
Some 60 species are currently accepted, with about 39 still unresolved. The genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, in the Americas from the southern United States to northern Argentina, in sub-Saharan Africa, in southern Asia, and in New Guinea, Australia, and the Pacific. The largest number of species are found in Africa, and the remainder in Australia, Hawaii, and Asia.

## Care Guide
Riverhemp is a rapidly growing annual that flourishes in full sun and consistently wet or waterlogged soil, mimicking its native wetland habitats. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and, as a legume, naturally contributes to soil fertility by fixing nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil. Excessive nitrogen fertilizer is often unnecessary, but it can benefit from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer in nutrient-poor soils.
