## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils. It requires very little water, being highly drought-tolerant, and should be watered infrequently. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization for best results, mimicking its native arid scrubland environment.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean to poor soils. Fertilization is generally not required, or only very sparingly with a low-strength, balanced formula in spring.
