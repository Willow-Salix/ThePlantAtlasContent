## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Channel Islands of Southern California, United States, and adjacent mainland coastal areas |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Coastal Scrub/Chaparral) |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) to thrive, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat on slopes and bluffs. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, especially during summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Monardella is a genus of approximately 40 species of annual and perennial plants native to western North America from British Columbia to northwestern Mexico. They are grown for their highly aromatic foliage, which in some species is used for herbal teas. The two-lipped, tubular flowers are formed in terminal clusters and are most usually red, pink, or purple.
Monardella is a Latin diminutive form of Monarda (a taxonomic patronym honoring the Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes), which the form of the flower heads resembles.  Plants in this genus are commonly known as wildmints, coyote mints or monardellas.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean coastal scrub habitat. It requires minimal water once established and prefers lean soil, making it very low-maintenance and drought-tolerant.

### Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; thrives in lean, rocky, or sandy soils. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, with a light, balanced fertilizer in early spring if growth appears weak.
