## Care Guide
Redroot thrives in consistently wet to waterlogged conditions, mirroring its native bog and marsh habitats. It prefers full sun to partial shade and requires very little fertilization. Ensure the soil never dries out to mimic its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; native wetland soils are often nutrient-poor. Use a diluted, balanced fertilizer sparingly if growth is poor.
