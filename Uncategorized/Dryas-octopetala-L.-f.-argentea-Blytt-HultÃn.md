## Introduction
Dryas octopetala, the mountain avens, eightpetal mountain-avens, white dryas or white dryad, is an Arctic–alpine flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is a small prostrate evergreen subshrub forming large colonies. The specific epithet octopetala derives from Greek octo 'eight' and petalon 'petal', referring to the eight petals of the flower, an unusual number in the Rosaceae, where five is the normal number. However, flowers with up to 16 petals also occur naturally.
As a floral emblem, it is the official territorial flower of the Northwest Territories and the national flower of Iceland.

## Care Guide
This alpine perennial thrives in full sun and highly well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native tundra environment. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization. It requires a cold winter dormancy to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean, nutrient-poor soils. Minimal to no fertilization is typically required, as rich soils can promote weak growth.
