## Care Guide
To mimic its desert origin, Arizona Desert-thorn requires abundant direct sunlight and should be watered infrequently, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs very little to no supplemental fertilizer, thriving in well-draining, nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization needed. If desired, use a very light, balanced fertilizer sparingly during the active growing season.
