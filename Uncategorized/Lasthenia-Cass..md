## Care Guide
Goldfields flourish in full sun conditions typical of their native Mediterranean climate. Provide moderate, consistent moisture during their active growth in winter and spring, then reduce watering significantly as they typically go dormant or complete their life cycle in dry summers. They require minimal fertilization and prefer well-draining, average to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; these plants thrive in average to lean soils and do not require heavy fertilization.
