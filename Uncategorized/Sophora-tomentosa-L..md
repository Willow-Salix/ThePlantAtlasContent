## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions of tropical and subtropical areas worldwide, including Florida, Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Pacific Islands. |
| **Climate** | Coastal Tropical and Subtropical Maritime |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its natural habitat on open beaches and dunes. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerant of drought once established, indicative of its sandy coastal environment. |

## Introduction
Sophora is a genus of about 45 species of small trees and shrubs in the pea family Fabaceae. The species have a pantropical distribution. The generic name is derived from sophera, an Arabic name for a pea-flowered tree.
The genus formerly had a broader interpretation including many other species now treated in other genera, notably Styphnolobium (pagoda tree genus), which differs in lacking nitrogen fixing bacteria (rhizobia) on the roots, and Dermatophyllum (the mescalbeans). Styphnolobium has galactomannans as seed polysaccharide reserve, in contrast Sophora contains arabinogalactans, and Dermatophyllum amylose.
The New Zealand Sophora species are known as kowhai.
The seeds of species such as Sophora affinis and Sophora chrysophylla are reported to be poisonous.

## Care Guide
The Yellow Necklacepod thrives in full sun and requires well-draining, sandy soil, mirroring its native coastal habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, as it is quite drought-tolerant once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, fertilizer needs are minimal.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it can fix nitrogen, reducing its need for supplemental nitrogen. Benefits from an occasional balanced fertilizer in very poor soils.
