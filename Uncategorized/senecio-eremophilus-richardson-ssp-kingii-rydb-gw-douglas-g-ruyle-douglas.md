## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (specifically mountainous regions of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane Semi-Arid to Subalpine (found in moist meadows, along streambanks, open forests, and sagebrush slopes at elevations typically between 1500-3000 m) |
| **☀️ Light** | Thrives in full sun, reflecting its exposure in open meadows and sagebrush slopes. Can tolerate some partial shade, particularly in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture, especially during the active growing season, due to its native habitat in moist areas like streambanks and meadows. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging; allow the top layer of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This subalpine species thrives with ample sunlight and consistent moisture, mimicking its high-elevation habitat. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root issues, and provide light fertilization during the growing season for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from light to moderate fertilization during its active growth period in spring and early summer. Use a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer, as native montane soils are typically not excessively rich.
