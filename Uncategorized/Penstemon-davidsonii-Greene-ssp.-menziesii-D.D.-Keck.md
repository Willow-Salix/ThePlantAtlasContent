## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically subalpine to alpine regions of California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine zones |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving best in full sun with good air circulation, especially in cooler alpine environments. |
| **Watering** | Requires well-drained soil and infrequent, deep watering once established. Adapted to rocky habitats, it tolerates dry conditions but dislikes consistently wet soil, particularly in winter. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This alpine native thrives in full sun and well-drained, rocky soil. Mimicking its natural habitat, provide infrequent watering once established and avoid rich, fertile soil or excessive fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot, especially in colder months.

### Fertilizer
Prefers lean to poor soil and typically requires no fertilization. Excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
