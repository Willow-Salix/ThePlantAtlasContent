## Introduction
Ptelea is a genus of flowering plants in the citrus family, Rutaceae. The name, of Greek derivation, is the classical name of the elm tree. Carl Linnaeus used that word for this genus because of the resemblance of its fruit to that of the elm. Members of the genus are commonly known as hoptrees.

## Care Guide
The Pallid Hoptree, native to arid scrublands, thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing infrequent deep watering. It requires minimal fertilization, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Light annual fertilization in spring, or none, is typically sufficient.
