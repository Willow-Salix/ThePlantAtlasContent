## Care Guide
Leiberg's Monkshood thrives in conditions mirroring its native cool, moist montane forest habitat. Provide partial shade to full sun, ensuring consistently moist, organically rich soil. Protect from intense afternoon sun, particularly in hotter regions, to prevent desiccation and stress.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, well-draining soil with ample organic matter. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer can be applied in early spring.
