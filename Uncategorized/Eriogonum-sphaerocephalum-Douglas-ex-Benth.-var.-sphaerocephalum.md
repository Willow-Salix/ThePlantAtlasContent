## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically the Intermountain West and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States, including Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, and eastern California) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Sagebrush Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Very low; highly drought-tolerant. Water sparingly and infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering, especially in poorly draining soil, is detrimental. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
Rock Buckwheat thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland, requiring full sun and extremely well-drained, lean soil. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant, making minimal watering crucial for its survival, and has very low nutrient needs, rendering fertilization largely unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Very low; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. Fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful. If growth is exceptionally poor in extremely depleted soil, a very dilute, low-nitrogen formula might be applied once a year.
