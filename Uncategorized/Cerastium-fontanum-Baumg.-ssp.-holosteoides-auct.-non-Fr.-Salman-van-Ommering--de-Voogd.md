## Introduction
Cerastium is a genus of annual, winter annual, or perennial flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. They are commonly called mouse-ears or mouse-ear chickweeds. There are 214 accepted species, found nearly worldwide but with the greatest concentration in the northern temperate regions. A number of the species are common weeds in fields and on disturbed ground.

Cerastium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora chalcogrammella (which feeds exclusively on Cerastium arvense) and Coleophora striatipennella (which has been recorded on Cerastium fontanum).

## Care Guide
This hardy plant is highly adaptable and requires minimal care. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure consistently moist, well-drained soil. Fertilization is generally not essential in average garden soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average soil and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly if soil nutrients are poor.
