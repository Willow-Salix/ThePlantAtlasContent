## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full to partial sun with excellent drainage, mimicking its native subalpine and alpine habitats. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly as it is adapted to lean soils and fixes nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so heavy nitrogen fertilization is generally not needed.
