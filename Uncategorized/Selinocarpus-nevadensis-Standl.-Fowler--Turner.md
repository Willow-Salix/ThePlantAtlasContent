## Introduction
Acleisanthes is a genus of flowering plants in the Bougainvillea family, Nyctaginaceae. There are currently 16 species. The generic name is derived from the Greek words ακλειοτος (akleistos), meaning "not closed", and ανθος (anthos), meaning "flower". Plants of this genus are known commonly as trumpets due to the elongated, open-ended shape of their flowers. These are arid-adapted perennials with thick taproots which are usually compact and low to the ground or slightly ascending. An individual plant may have cleistogamous (unopening and self-pollinating) flowers as well as opening flowers which are usually nocturnal as a water-saving adaptation and are pollinated by night-flying or crepuscular insects such as hawkmoths. Flowers are usually white, sometimes yellow. These plants are native to the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts of Mexico and the United States.

## Care Guide
The Desert Moonpod thrives in conditions mimicking its arid native habitat. Provide full sun and very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly to prevent root rot. It requires well-draining soil and very little, if any, fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. If necessary, use a very diluted, low-nitrogen fertilizer sparingly during active growth.
