## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Afromontane regions of East Africa, including Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands (Afromontane woodlands and savannas) |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat in savannas and clearings. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during active growth, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, reflecting its adaptation to distinct wet and dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Vachellia is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae, commonly known as thorn trees or acacias. It belongs to the subfamily Mimosoideae. Its species were considered members of genus Acacia until 2009. Vachellia can be distinguished from other acacias by its capitate inflorescences and spinescent stipules. Before discovery of the New World, Europeans in the Mediterranean region were familiar with several species of Vachellia, which they knew as sources of medicine, and had names for them that they inherited from the Greeks and Romans.
The wide-ranging genus occurs in a variety of open, tropical to subtropical habitats, and is locally dominant. In parts of Africa, Vachellia species are shaped progressively by grazing animals of increasing size and height, such as gazelle, gerenuk, and giraffe. The genus in Africa has thus developed thorns in defence against such herbivory.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant tree thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its East African Afromontane environment. Water moderately during growing periods, allowing soil to dry, and minimize fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Light, as this legume fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. A balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season if soil is poor.
