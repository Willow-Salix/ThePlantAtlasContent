## 🌱 Overview
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bryum gemmiparum thrives in consistently moist, humid environments with bright indirect light to partial shade. As a moss, it has minimal nutrient requirements and should be fertilized very sparingly, if at all. Maintain high humidity and never allow the substrate to dry out completely.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; an infrequent, highly diluted liquid fertilizer (if any) is sufficient.
