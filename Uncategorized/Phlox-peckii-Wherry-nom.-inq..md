## Introduction
Phlox (; Ancient Greek: φλόξ "flame"; plural "phlox" or "phloxes", Ancient Greek: φλόγες phlóges) is a genus of 68 species of perennial and annual plants in the family Polemoniaceae. They are found mostly in North America (one in Siberia) in diverse habitats from alpine tundra to open woodland and prairie. Some flower in spring, others in summer and fall.

## Care Guide
Peck's phlox thrives in conditions mimicking its native alpine habitat, requiring full sun and exceptionally well-draining, lean soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and avoid rich soils or excessive moisture to prevent issues.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; use a very lean, well-draining soil and avoid over-fertilization, which can harm it.
