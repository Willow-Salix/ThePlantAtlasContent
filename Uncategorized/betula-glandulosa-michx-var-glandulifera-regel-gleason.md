## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cold-hardy shrub thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently moist to wet, acidic soil, mimicking its native bog and subalpine environments. Fertilization should be light, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions and does not tolerate drought.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization, especially if grown in nutrient-poor or boggy soil. Prefers acidic conditions.
