| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate regions including Western Europe (e.g., British Isles, Scandinavia), North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest), and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Oceanic/Montane Climate (high rainfall, high humidity, often shaded woodland or exposed, damp rock faces) |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade; prefers indirect light and protection from direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist, never allowing the substrate to dry out; requires very high ambient humidity. |

## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in consistently moist, highly humid environments with low to partial light, mimicking its native damp, temperate habitats. Avoid direct sunlight and strong fertilizers, as bryophytes have very minimal nutrient needs and are sensitive to chemical inputs.

### Fertilizer
Very low; minimal to no fertilization is typically required, as bryophytes absorb nutrients from dilute solutions and rainfall.
