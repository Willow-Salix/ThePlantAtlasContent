## Introduction
Aconitum columbianum is a species of flowering plant in the buttercup family known by the common names Columbian monkshood or western monkshood.
This wildflower is native to western North America where it grows in riparian and other moist areas, in meadows and coniferous forests. It is found from 600–2,900 metres (2,000–9,500 ft) in elevation.

## Care Guide
This Aconitum variety thrives in conditions similar to its native Rocky Mountain habitat. Provide full sun in cool, high-altitude regions or partial shade in warmer areas, alongside consistently moist, well-draining, and fertile soil. Regular watering is essential to prevent drying out, mimicking its natural preference for moist stream banks and meadows.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, organic-rich feed in early spring, particularly if the soil is not naturally rich. Prefers humus-rich, well-draining soil.
