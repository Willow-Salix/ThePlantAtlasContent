## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically mountainous regions from British Columbia south through the Rocky Mountains (e.g., Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subalpine Montane Meadows and Open Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving with full sun in cooler climates or partial shade in hotter regions to protect from intense afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist but well-drained soil, particularly during its active growth period. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## Care Guide
This Geranium thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring consistently moist, well-drained soil that mimics its native montane meadow habitats. Provide regular watering throughout the growing season and a light spring feeding to support its vigorous growth and abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderately fertile, humus-rich soil. A light application of balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or well-rotted compost in early spring is sufficient.
