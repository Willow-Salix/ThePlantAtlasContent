## Care Guide
Vernal Water-starwort is an aquatic plant native to temperate to boreal freshwater habitats. It requires constant wetness, preferring full sun to partial shade in nutrient-rich water. Ensure continuous submersion to prevent drying and maintain its health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It naturally derives nutrients from its aquatic environment or a nutrient-rich substrate. Supplementation is generally not needed if grown in a healthy pond or bog setup.
