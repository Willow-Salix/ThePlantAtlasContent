## Introduction
Sabatia, the rose gentians, is a genus of about 20 species of flowering plants in the family Gentianaceae, native to eastern and central North America (Nova Scotia west to Wisconsin and New Mexico, and south to Florida and Texas), Central America, and the Caribbean.
They are annual or perennial herbaceous plants growing to 10–130 cm tall, with opposite leaves. The flowers are produced in large cymes at the top of the stems; the flower corolla has 5–12 lobes, colored pink or white, with a contrasting central yellow 'eye'. The fruit is a capsule containing numerous small seeds.

## Care Guide
Appalachian Rose Gentian thrives in the humid subtropical conditions of temperate wetlands. Provide full to partial sun and ensure the soil remains consistently moist, never allowing it to dry out. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils, so fertilizing should be minimal or avoided.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, thus requiring minimal to no fertilization; avoid rich, high-nutrient fertilizers.
