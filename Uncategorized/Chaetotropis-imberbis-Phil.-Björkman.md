## Care Guide
This Andean grass requires full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native steppe environment. Water moderately, letting the soil dry out between sessions, and fertilize sparingly. It is a resilient plant, well-suited to dry and sunny conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring is sufficient, or none if grown in rich soil.
