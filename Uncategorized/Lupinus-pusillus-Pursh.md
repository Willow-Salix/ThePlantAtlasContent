## Care Guide
Rusty lupine thrives in challenging, dry environments with abundant sunlight. Ensure it receives full sun and is planted in extremely well-draining soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications, and avoid fertilizing due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to No Fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen, making it less reliant on external soil nutrients.
