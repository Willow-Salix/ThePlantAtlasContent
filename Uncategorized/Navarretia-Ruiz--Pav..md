## Care Guide
Pincushionplants thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring moderate moisture during their spring growth phase. They are adapted to dry, hot summers and require minimal to no water during this dormant period, along with very low fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, especially in very poor soils. Avoid over-fertilization.
