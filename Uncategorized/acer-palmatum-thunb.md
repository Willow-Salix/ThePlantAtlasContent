## 🧤 Care Instructions
Japanese maples thrive in locations with partial sun to dappled shade and require consistent soil moisture with excellent drainage. Protection from harsh afternoon sun is essential to prevent leaf scorch. Provide moderate fertilization, favoring organic amendments, to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate nutrient needs. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, or amendments with organic compost. Avoid over-fertilization, which can harm the tree.
