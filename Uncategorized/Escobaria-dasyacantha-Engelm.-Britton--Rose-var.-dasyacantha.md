## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in its native arid conditions, requiring full sun and extremely well-draining soil. Mimic its environment by watering deeply only when the soil is completely dry, curtailing water in winter. Provide minimal fertilization during its active growth for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. Apply a diluted, balanced fertilizer formulated for cacti and succulents once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer).
