## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona) and Northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Chihuahuan Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. Requires at least 6-8 hours of direct, intense sunlight daily, typical of open desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Low. Extremely drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry out between waterings. Overwatering can be detrimental. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dyssodia is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Many species formerly included in Dyssodia are now treated as members of other related genera, including Thymophylla or Adenophyllum. Dyssodia papposa is usually retained in this genus.  The name is derived from the Greek δυσοδια (dusodia), meaning "ill-smelling".
Several species of Dyssodia (sensu lato) have found their way into the nursery trade and are relatively popular flowering annuals for hot, dry sites.  Generally sold as threadleaf dyssodia (Dyssodia tenuisecta) and golden dyssodia (Dyssodia cf. pentachaeta).  They perform best in well-drained soil.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun, characteristic of its arid scrubland native habitat. It requires minimal water, allowing the soil to completely dry between waterings, and very little to no fertilization. Excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Native to lean, rocky desert soils, it requires minimal to no fertilization. If needed, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season.
