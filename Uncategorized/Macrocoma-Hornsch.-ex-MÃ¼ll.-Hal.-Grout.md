## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across warm temperate and subtropical regions globally, including parts of the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia. |
| **Climate** | Warm Temperate to Subtropical Woodlands and Rocky Outcrops |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate some direct morning sun, especially when growing epiphytically or on exposed rocks. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the substrate to dry out significantly between waterings. Tolerant of periods of drought; avoid prolonged saturation. |

## Introduction
Macrocoma is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It contains about 100 species, which are found in tropical Africa, around the Mediterranean, on the Canary Islands, in western and central Asia, and in India.
Macrocoma is closely related to the African genus Pseudocolaspis, and has sometimes been treated as a junior synonym of it historically. The two genera are distinguished by the exposure of the pygidium and the shape of the anterior edges of the prosternum: in Macrocoma, the pygidium is covered by the elytra and the anterior edges of the prosternum are flat, while in Pseudocolaspis, the pygidium is more than half-exposed and the anterior edges of the prosternum are convex. Currently, several species are not arranged according to these characters.

## Care Guide
Macrocoma moss thrives in bright, open conditions typical of its native warm temperate to subtropical habitats. It requires moderate watering with periods of dryness and has very low nutrient needs, making it relatively low-maintenance for the right environment.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Minimal fertilization, if any, using a highly diluted liquid feed only during active growth.
