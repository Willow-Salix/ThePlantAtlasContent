## Introduction
Navarretia is a genus of flowering plants related to the phloxes and the gilias. This is one genus of plants, among others, which are sometimes called pincushion plants. It includes 45 species native to the Americas. In North America they range from western Canada through the western and west-central United States to northwestern Mexico, and to Ohio and Pennsylvania. In South America they range through Argentina and Chile.
The inflorescence which bears the flowers is surrounded by frilly green bracts bearing soft spines, giving it the appearance of a pincushion. Several species are members of the vernal pool ecosystem.

## Care Guide
This annual plant, native to California's Mediterranean climate, thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean to moderately fertile soils. It requires consistent moisture during its active growth period in late winter and spring, then tolerates dry conditions as it completes its lifecycle.

### Fertilizer
Low. Prefers lean to moderately fertile soils. Excessive fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
