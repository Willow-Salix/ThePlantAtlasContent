## Introduction

## Care Guide
The Pyjama Lily thrives in conditions mimicking its native savanna, needing full sun to partial shade and a distinct wet/dry cycle. Water generously during its active growing season and reduce dramatically during winter dormancy. Fertilize moderately when actively growing to encourage robust blooming.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growth phase. Withhold fertilizer during dormancy.
