## Care Guide
Apache Plume is a remarkably hardy, low-maintenance plant. Provide it with full sun and well-draining soil, and water sparingly once established. Fertilization is generally not necessary, reflecting its native arid scrubland conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to poor, rocky desert soils and generally does not require fertilization. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth.
