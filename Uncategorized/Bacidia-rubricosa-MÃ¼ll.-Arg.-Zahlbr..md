## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of South America (e.g., Brazil), Australia, and Oceania. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to partial shade. Prefers sheltered locations on tree bark, avoiding harsh direct sun. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity and frequent exposure to moisture (e.g., rainfall, dew, or mist). Does not tolerate prolonged dry periods but can recover from temporary desiccation. |

## Introduction
Bacidia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. These lichens are characterised by their crustose growth form, distinctive club-shaped reproductive structures called apothecia that contain long, needle-like spores, and their symbiotic partnership with green algae. Bacidia species typically grow on various substrates including tree bark, rock surfaces, and occasionally soil, and are distinguished from related genera by their specific spore characteristics and internal structures.

## Care Guide
Bacidia rubricosa is a corticolous lichen best suited to environments with high humidity and indirect light, mirroring its native tropical and subtropical forest habitat. It obtains moisture and nutrients from the air and precipitation, therefore requiring no conventional watering or fertilization. Ensure good air circulation to maintain its health.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens absorb all necessary nutrients directly from airborne particles and precipitation. Traditional fertilizers are detrimental.
