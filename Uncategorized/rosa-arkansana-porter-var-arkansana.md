## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Prairie Rose thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native grassland environment. It requires moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry out between sessions, and is fairly drought-tolerant once established. Feed moderately in spring for best performance, but avoid over-fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced fertilizer in spring, but can thrive in average to rich, well-draining soils without extensive feeding, consistent with nutrient cycling in grassland ecosystems.
