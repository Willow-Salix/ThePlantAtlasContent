## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires very well-draining soil, mirroring its native serpentine habitats in California. It is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, thus needing minimal to no supplemental fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization needed. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor serpentine soils, and excessive nutrients may be detrimental.
