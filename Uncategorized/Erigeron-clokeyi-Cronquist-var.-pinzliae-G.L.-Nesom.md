## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Nevada, Arizona), specifically the Spring Mountains region of Clark County, Nevada. |
| **Climate** | Arid Montane Scrubland / Pinyon-Juniper Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (at least 6-8 hours direct sunlight daily), as it grows in exposed, open, and rocky slopes. |
| **Watering** | Low; drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its native arid environment. |

## Introduction
Erigeron () is a large genus of plants in the composite family (Asteraceae). It is placed in the tribe Astereae and is closely related to the Old World asters (Aster) and the true daisies (Bellis). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and the highest diversity occurs in North America.

## Care Guide
Clokey's fleabane thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, typical of its native arid montane habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and has very low fertilizer needs. Mimicking these harsh, dry, and exposed conditions is key to its successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none; it thrives in lean, poor to average soils typical of rocky mountain slopes and does not require rich nutrient levels.
