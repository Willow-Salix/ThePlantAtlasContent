## Introduction
Pleurothallis is a genus of orchids commonly called bonnet orchids. The genus name is derived from the Greek word pleurothallos, meaning "riblike branches". This refers to the rib-like stems of many species. The genus is often abbreviated as "Pths" in horticultural trade.
This was a huge genus, which contained more than 1,200 species - the second largest in the Orchidaceae after Bulbophyllum. In 2004, it decreased by more than half when many species were moved into new genera.

## Care Guide
This orchid thrives in cool to intermediate temperatures, requiring high humidity and consistently moist conditions in a well-draining medium. Provide diffused, indirect light and fertilize lightly but regularly to mimic its native tropical montane cloud forest habitat.

### Fertilizer
As an epiphyte, it benefits from weak, dilute fertilizer. Apply a balanced orchid fertilizer at 1/4 to 1/8 strength with every 2-4 waterings during active growth.
