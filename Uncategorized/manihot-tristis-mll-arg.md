## 🧤 Care Instructions
Manihot tristis thrives in conditions mimicking its native South American savanna and semi-arid habitats. Provide full sun and ensure excellent drainage, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings due to its drought tolerance. Fertilize sparingly during the growing season to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the main growing season, or a diluted liquid feed every 4-6 weeks.
