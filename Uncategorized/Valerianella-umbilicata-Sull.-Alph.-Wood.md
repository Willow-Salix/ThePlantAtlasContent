Valerianella is a genus of flowering plant in family Caprifoliaceae. It includes 23 species native to the Mediterranean Basin of southern Europe and North Africa, western and central Asia, Madeira and the Azores, and Ethiopia and Kenya.

## Care Guide
Navel Cornsalad thrives in the partial sun and moist, well-drained soils characteristic of its native Eastern U.S. woodland habitat. Provide consistent moisture during its spring growth and offer low to moderate nutrients to support its annual lifecycle.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer at planting may be beneficial in nutrient-poor soils.
