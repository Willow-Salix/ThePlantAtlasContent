## 🌱 Overview
Phaseolus (bean, wild bean) is a genus of herbaceous to woody annual and perennial vines in the family Fabaceae containing about 70 plant species, all native to the Americas, primarily Mesoamerica.
It is one of the most economically important legume genera. Five of the species have been domesticated since pre-Columbian times for their beans: P. acutifolius (tepary bean), P. coccineus (runner bean), P. dumosus (year bean), P. lunatus (lima bean), and P. vulgaris (common bean). Most prominent among these is the common bean, P. vulgaris, which today is cultivated worldwide in tropical, semitropical, and temperate climates.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-native plant thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage. Water deeply but infrequently, ensuring the soil dries completely between sessions to prevent root rot. It is adapted to lean conditions and needs minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very diluted, balanced fertilizer during its active growing season.
