## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains, Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to very bright light, requiring intense exposure similar to high-altitude environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is needed, but excellent drainage is paramount; allow soil to dry completely between waterings to prevent root rot, as it is adapted to periods of drought. |

## Introduction
Androsace, commonly known as rock jasmine, is a genus of flowering plants in the  family Primulaceae, second only to Primula in the number of species. It is predominantly Arctic–alpine, with many species in the Himalayas (where the genus originated), the mountains of central Asia, the Caucasus, and the southern and central European mountain systems, particularly the Alps and the Pyrenees.
Plants of this genus are sometimes known as rock jasmines or fairy candelabras, and are widely cultivated for their dense cushions covered in white or pink flowers. There are roughly 110 species.
These plants have small entire or toothed leaves which form a basal rosette.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant demands full sun and extremely well-drained, gritty soil to replicate its native habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and keep fertilization to a minimum to ensure its longevity.

### Fertilizer
Very low, as it naturally grows in lean, rocky, nutrient-poor soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very diluted, balanced fertilizer.
