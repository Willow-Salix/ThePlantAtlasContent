## Care Guide
Smooth Menziesia thrives in consistently moist, acidic, well-drained soil under partial shade, though it can tolerate full sun in cooler, high-elevation areas. It requires regular watering to prevent drying out and benefits from minimal fertilization. This plant is well-suited to conditions mimicking its native temperate subalpine forest environment.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization. If needed, apply a light dose of an acidic, slow-release fertilizer in early spring. Avoid over-fertilizing.
