## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern North America (United States, Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Prairies and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and flowering, typical of open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Tolerant of some drought once established, preferring consistent moisture in well-drained soil, reflecting its presence in areas with moderate rainfall. |

## Care Guide
Redwhisker Clammyweed thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native prairie and open woodland environments. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and fertilize sparingly as it adapts well to less fertile conditions. It is a relatively low-maintenance plant once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, especially in poor soils. Its native disturbed and sandy soils suggest it does not require high nutrient levels.
