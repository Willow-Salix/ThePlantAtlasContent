## Introduction
The Cyperaceae () are a family of  graminoid (grass-like), monocotyledonous flowering plants known as sedges. The family is large; botanists have described some 5,500 known species in about 90 genera – the largest being the "true sedges" (genus Carex), with over 2,000 species.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in consistently wet conditions, requiring continuously moist to wet soil to replicate its marshy native habitat. It prefers full sun to partial sun exposure for optimal growth. Fertilizer needs are low to moderate, benefiting from organic matter but adaptable to various soil fertility levels.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from organically rich soil but is generally not a heavy feeder and can tolerate less fertile, waterlogged conditions.
