## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in humid, clean environments with filtered light. Provide high ambient humidity through misting or a humid enclosure, and ensure good air circulation. Traditional watering and fertilization are unnecessary and can be detrimental to its growth.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens absorb nutrients directly from air, dust, and rainwater; traditional fertilizers are not needed and can be harmful.
