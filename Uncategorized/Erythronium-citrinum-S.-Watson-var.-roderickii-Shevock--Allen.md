## Introduction
Erythronium, the fawn lily, trout lily, dog's-tooth violet or adder's tongue, is a genus of Eurasian and North American plants in the lily family, most closely related to tulips. The name Erythronium derives from Ancient Greek ἐρυθρός (eruthrós) "red" in Greek, referring to the red flowers of E. dens-canis. Of all the established species, most live in North America; only six species are found in Europe and Asia.

## Care Guide
Roderick's Fawnlily flourishes in partial shade with well-draining, nutrient-poor soil, mirroring its native Californian woodland environment. It necessitates consistent moisture during its spring growth phase, followed by a dry dormancy through summer, and benefits from minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. This plant is native to nutrient-poor serpentine soils and is sensitive to excessive nutrients.
