## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This sedge thrives in partial sun to partial shade, mimicking its native temperate woodland habitat in Eastern North America. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Mimic its natural environment for best growth, ensuring adequate moisture and protection from intense afternoon sun.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring can promote growth, but it is generally not a heavy feeder.
