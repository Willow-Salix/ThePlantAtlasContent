## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northeastern USA (specifically Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Wetland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, favoring good light exposure for best fruit production. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is key; the soil should be kept moist but well-drained, reflecting its native habitat in swamps and moist thickets. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rubus cuneifolius, the sand blackberry, is a North American species of flowering plant in the rose family. It occurs in the eastern United States in every coastal state from Louisiana to New Hampshire, with the exception of Rhode Island. There are also reports of inland populations in Tennessee, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, and the species has become an invasive species in South Africa.
Within its native range, R. cuneifolius has been observed in habitat types such as hardwood forests, longleaf pinelands, and in wooded floodplains. It has also been observed in disturbed environments such as along roadsides and firebreaks. 
The genetics of Rubus is extremely complex, so that it is difficult to decide on which groups should be recognized as species. There are many rare species with limited ranges such as this. Further study is suggested to clarify the taxonomy.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Long's Blackberry thrives in a temperate wetland environment, requiring consistent soil moisture and preferring full sun to partial shade. Ensure good drainage while maintaining hydration, and provide moderate nutrients to support its growth and fruit production.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. A balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost applied in early spring can support growth, especially in naturally poorer wetland soils.
