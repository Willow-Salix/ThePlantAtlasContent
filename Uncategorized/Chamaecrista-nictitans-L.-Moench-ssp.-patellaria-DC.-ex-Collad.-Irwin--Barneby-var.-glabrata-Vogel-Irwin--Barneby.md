## Introduction
Chamaecrista is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Members of the genus are commonly known as sensitive pea. Several species are capable of rapid plant movement. Unlike the related genera Cassia and Senna, members of Chamaecrista form root nodules.
Chamaecrista has 367 species, with a wide distribution – the Americas from Minnesota to northern Argentina, sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Iran, the Indian Subcontinent, Indochina, China, Korea, Japan, Malesia, New Guinea, and Australia.

## Care Guide
This Sensitive Partridge Pea thrives in full to partial sun, mimicking its native tropical savanna environment. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between applications, and benefits from well-draining soil. Fertilize sparingly, as its nitrogen-fixing ability reduces the need for external nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.
