## Care Guide
This subtropical plant thrives in full sun with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native hillside and forest edge habitats. Ensure regular watering, especially during warm periods and fruit development, and provide moderate fertilization to support its growth and yield.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer or organic compost during active growth and fruiting. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, excessive nitrogen may not be necessary.
