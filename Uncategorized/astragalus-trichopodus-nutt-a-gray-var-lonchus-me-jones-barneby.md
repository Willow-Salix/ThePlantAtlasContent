## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in its native Mediterranean shrubland, the Santa Barbara Milkvetch requires full sun and is exceptionally drought-tolerant, needing infrequent deep watering once established. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, its fertilizer requirements are very low, making it a low-maintenance plant adapted to poor, well-draining soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so minimal or no supplementary fertilizer is typically required, perhaps a very light, balanced slow-release formula in spring if growth is sluggish.
