| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Rocky Mountains region of the United States and Canada (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Utah). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane / Alpine (found in subalpine meadows, open slopes, and dry, rocky areas at higher elevations). |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. This plant thrives in the intense sunlight characteristic of high-altitude, open environments. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid waterlogging, especially during cooler periods. |

## Care Guide
This plant flourishes in full sun and requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot. It is very drought-tolerant, so water only when the soil is completely dry. Minimal fertilization is necessary, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor native soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Native to lean, rocky soils, it does not require rich nutrients. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient if desired, or none at all.
