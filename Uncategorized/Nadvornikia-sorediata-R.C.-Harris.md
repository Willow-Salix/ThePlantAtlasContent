## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in highly humid, shaded environments, mimicking its native temperate humid forest habitat. Provide consistent moisture through misting or high ambient humidity, and ensure good air circulation. Avoid direct sunlight and refrain from traditional fertilization, as lichens are sensitive to excess nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Lichens are sensitive to nutrient overload; they derive necessary elements from air and rainwater.
