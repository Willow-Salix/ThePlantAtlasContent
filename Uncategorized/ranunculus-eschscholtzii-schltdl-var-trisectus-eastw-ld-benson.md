## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mountainous regions of Western North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada, Cascades), extending into Alaska and Canada. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra to Subalpine |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, accustomed to high light exposure at altitude. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate and consistent moisture, especially during the growing season, mimicking snowmelt; essential to have excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ranunculus  is a large genus of about 1750 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Members of the genus are known as buttercups, spearworts and water crowfoots.
The genus is distributed worldwide, primarily in temperate and montane regions. The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, which has extremely tough and tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much taller meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris. In ornamental  gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.
Buttercups usually flower in the spring, but flowers may be found throughout the summer, especially where the plants are growing as opportunistic colonizers, as in the case of garden weeds.
The water crowfoots (Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium), which grow in still or running water, are sometimes treated in a separate genus Batrachium (from Greek βάτραχος bátrakhos, "frog"). They have two different leaf types, thread-like leaves underwater and broader floating leaves. In some species, such as R. aquatilis, a third, intermediate leaf type occurs.
Ranunculus species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Hebrew character and small angle shades. Some species are popular ornamental flowers in horticulture, with many cultivars selected for large and brightly coloured flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in cool temperatures with high light exposure and consistent moisture, requiring excellent drainage. Avoid over-fertilization as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to lean, rocky soils. Use a very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer sparingly, if at all.
