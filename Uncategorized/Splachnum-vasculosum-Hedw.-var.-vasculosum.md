## Introduction
Splachnum, also known as dung moss or petticoat moss, is a genus of moss that is well known for its entomophily. It commonly grows on patches of dung or decomposing animal matter.

## Care Guide
This unique moss thrives in cool, consistently moist conditions with high humidity and bright indirect light. Its specific preference for growing on animal dung necessitates a nutrient-rich, nitrogenous substrate to replicate its natural habitat and support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Requires a substrate exceptionally rich in organic matter and nitrogen, ideally mimicking the nutrient profile of herbivore dung. Supplement with a very dilute, high-nitrogen organic fertilizer if not grown on its natural substrate.
