## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across tropical and subtropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, the Arabian Peninsula, South and Southeast Asia, and Northern Australia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests (often in disturbed areas, forest margins, and clearings, sometimes near watercourses). |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade. As a pioneer species, it thrives in bright, direct or dappled light for several hours daily, adapting well to varying light conditions found at forest edges or clearings. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture, especially during the active growing season. Keep the soil consistently moist but well-drained. It can tolerate brief dry periods once established, reflecting its native habitat's often distinct wet and dry seasons. |

## Care Guide
Oriental Trema is a robust, fast-growing plant from tropical and subtropical climates that thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growth periods. Its adaptability makes it relatively low-maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to low fertilizer needs. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer can be applied every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer) to support its fast growth, but avoid over-fertilization.
