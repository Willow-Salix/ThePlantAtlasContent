## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia. Often found in mountainous or boreal regions. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forests, Boreal Forests, and Subalpine/Alpine zones. Typically found in disturbed, open, or partially shaded areas with acidic soil. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Shade to Full Shade. While it can tolerate some direct sun in consistently cool and moist conditions, it generally prefers protection from harsh, direct sunlight to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged. Requires regular watering or high ambient humidity to mimic its natural damp environment and prevent drying out. |

## Introduction
Pogonatum is a genus of mosses — commonly called spike moss — which contains approximately 70 species that cover a cosmopolitan distribution. It can be seen mostly in Asian countries with a tropical climate.

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, moist, and shady conditions, mimicking its native temperate to boreal forest floor habitat. Ensure consistent moisture and high humidity, avoiding direct sun and waterlogging. Fertilization is not required, as mosses prefer nutrient-poor substrates.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses thrive in nutrient-poor environments, and fertilizing is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
