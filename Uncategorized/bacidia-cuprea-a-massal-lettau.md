## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest and Woodland biomes. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers moderate to bright indirect light or partial sun. Tolerates some direct morning sun but should be protected from intense afternoon sun, especially in warmer climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Does not require soil watering. Obtains moisture directly from atmospheric humidity, dew, and rainfall. Requires cycles of hydration followed by drying periods to prevent fungal growth and ensure health. High ambient humidity is beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bacidia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. These lichens are characterised by their crustose growth form, distinctive club-shaped reproductive structures called apothecia that contain long, needle-like spores, and their symbiotic partnership with green algae. Bacidia species typically grow on various substrates including tree bark, rock surfaces, and occasionally soil, and are distinguished from related genera by their specific spore characteristics and internal structures.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Bacidia cuprea, provide a stable environment with moderate to bright indirect light and good air circulation. Ensure clean air and regular cycles of hydration from atmospheric moisture (like misting or natural rainfall) followed by drying periods. Avoid traditional fertilizers and intense, direct sunlight.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens are highly sensitive to pollutants and high nutrient levels; traditional fertilizers are detrimental. Requires clean air and a stable, non-toxic substrate (bark or rock).
