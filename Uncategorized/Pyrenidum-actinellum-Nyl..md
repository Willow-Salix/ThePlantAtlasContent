# Pyrenidum actinellum Nyl.

*Pyrenidum actinellum Nyl.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of Europe, North America, and Asia, following the distribution of its host lichen. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forests (often found in open woodlands or forest edges) |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to bright indirect light; direct harsh sun can be detrimental. It thrives in well-lit but sheltered locations on its host. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and frequent exposure to moisture from rain or dew. It does not tolerate prolonged dry periods or standing water. |

## Care Guide
This lichenicolous fungus is dependent on its specific host lichen, *Parmelia sulcata*, for survival. Therefore, its 'care' involves maintaining an environment suitable for the host: high humidity, moderate to bright indirect light, and clean, moist air typical of temperate and boreal forests.

### Fertilizer
No external fertilization is required. As a lichenicolous fungus, it obtains nutrients directly from its host lichen and airborne particles.
