## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada) and Eurasia (e.g., Siberia, Scandinavia) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, accustomed to open, exposed conditions with long daylight hours during the growing season. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil, especially during the growing season, but requires good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Tolerant of wet conditions often found from snowmelt. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
The Barren Ground Willow thrives in cold, exposed environments, requiring full to partial sun. Ensure its soil remains consistently moist but well-drained, mirroring its native tundra habitat. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in nutrient-poor, thin soils. If necessary, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly, but generally not required.
