## Introduction
Lobularia maritima (syn. Alyssum maritimum) is a species of low-growing flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. Its common name is sweet alyssum or sweet Alison, also commonly referred to as just alyssum (from the genus Alyssum in which it was formerly classified).

## Care Guide
Sweet Alyssum flourishes in full sun with well-drained soil, reflecting its Mediterranean origins. It requires moderate watering but tolerates periods of drought, and benefits from minimal fertilization. This makes it a low-maintenance choice for borders and rock gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Native to often poor, rocky soils, it does not require rich soil or heavy feeding. An annual light application of balanced fertilizer is sufficient if growth seems weak.
