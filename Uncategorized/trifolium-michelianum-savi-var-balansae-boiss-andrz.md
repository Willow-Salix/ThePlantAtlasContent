## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean region (Southern Europe, North Africa, Middle East) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it typically grows in open grasslands and pastures. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, especially during its active growing season (cooler months). Tolerates periods of drought once established, mimicking its native dry summers. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Balansa Clover thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its Mediterranean origins. It requires moderate watering during its active growing season and tolerates established drought conditions. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally does not need high nitrogen fertilizer, though phosphorus and potassium can be beneficial.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nitrogen fertilizer requirements due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume. May benefit from phosphorus and potassium supplements if soil is deficient.
