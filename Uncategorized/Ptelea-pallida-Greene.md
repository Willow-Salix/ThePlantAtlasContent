Ptelea is a genus of flowering plants in the citrus family, Rutaceae. The name, of Greek derivation, is the classical name of the elm tree. Carl Linnaeus used that word for this genus because of the resemblance of its fruit to that of the elm. Members of the genus are commonly known as hoptrees.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in hot, dry conditions typical of its native arid and semi-arid regions. It requires full sun exposure, excellent drainage, and is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing minimal watering and fertilizer. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs. Generally does not require supplemental fertilization. In very poor soils, a light, balanced fertilizer application annually may be beneficial.
