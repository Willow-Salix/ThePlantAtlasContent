## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Texas, USA (Rio Grande Plain, Trans-Pecos) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal water. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its native arid and semi-arid Texas habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. Fertilization needs are minimal, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly, perhaps once a year in spring with a balanced, diluted fertilizer, or not at all if planted in native soil.
