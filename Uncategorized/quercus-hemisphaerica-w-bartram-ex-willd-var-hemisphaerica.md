## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Coastal Plain, from southeastern Virginia south to Florida, and west to southeastern Louisiana) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth, tolerating partial shade. As a large canopy tree, it needs ample light exposure to thrive. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during establishment. Once mature, it has moderate drought tolerance but benefits from regular watering during prolonged dry spells, mimicking its native humid climate with consistent rainfall. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Darlington Oak thrives in the humid subtropical conditions of the southeastern U.S. It requires full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially when young. Established trees are relatively low-maintenance, needing minimal fertilization and tolerating moderate drought.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer is needed once established in suitable soil. Young trees may benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring to support growth, particularly in poorer soils.
