## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central America, South America (e.g., Brazil, Colombia), and the Caribbean islands. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest to Tropical Savanna/Disturbed Open Areas |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. It thrives in open, exposed areas, forest edges, and disturbed sites in its native range, indicating a need for bright, direct light for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Regular and consistent watering, especially during the growing season, to mimic the high rainfall of its native tropical climate. Allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent waterlogging, but avoid prolonged drought. |

## Introduction
Stachytarpheta is a plant genus in the verbena family (Verbenaceae). The flowers are rich in nectar and popular with many butterflies, such as the South Asian crimson rose, Malabar banded swallowtail, and grass yellow. Hummingbirds, especially small species like Lophornis coquettes, Chlorostilbon emeralds, and Discosura thorntails, are especially attracted for nectar. Several species in this genus are known as porterweeds. In Australia the genus is known as snakeweed.

## Care Guide
Cayenne Porterweed prefers a location with full to partial sun and requires consistent moisture, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Fertilize moderately during active growth to encourage its vibrant blooms and strong habit, mirroring its robust nature in tropical disturbed areas.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied every 4-6 weeks can support its vigorous growth, reflecting its ability to thrive in varying soil fertility levels in its native disturbed habitats.
