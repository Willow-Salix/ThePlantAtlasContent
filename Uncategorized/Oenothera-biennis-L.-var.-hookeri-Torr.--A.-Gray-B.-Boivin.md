## Care Guide
Hooker's Evening Primrose thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting its native habitat in riparian zones and open woodlands of Western North America. It is not a heavy feeder, requiring low to moderate fertilization. This hardy plant is adaptable but benefits from regular watering, especially during dry periods, to mimic its natural preference for moist conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Growing naturally in various soil types, often in disturbed areas, this plant does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in very poor soils.
