## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Asia (China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan), Southeast Asia (e.g., Vietnam), and parts of the Himalayas (Nepal, Bhutan, India) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to deep shade, thriving in indirect or low light conditions typical of a forest understory. Avoid direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture, keeping the soil evenly moist but never waterlogged. Requires high humidity, mimicking its native forest environment. |

## Introduction
Huperzia is a genus of lycophyte plants, sometimes known as the firmosses or fir clubmosses; the Flora of North America calls them gemma fir-mosses. This genus was originally included in the related genus Lycopodium, from which it differs in having undifferentiated sporangial leaves, and the sporangia not formed into apical cones.  The common name firmoss, used for some of the north temperate species, refers to their superficial resemblance to branches of fir (Abies), a conifer. As of 2020, two very different circumscriptions of the genus were in use. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Huperzia is one of three genera in the subfamily Huperzioideae of the family Lycopodiaceae. Most species in the subfamily are placed in the genus Phlegmariurus. Huperzia is left with about 25 species, although not all have been formally transferred to other genera. Other sources recognize only Huperzia, which then has about 340 species.

## Care Guide
To care for Chinese Clubmoss, replicate its native humid montane forest environment by providing consistently moist, well-drained soil and high humidity. Ensure it receives only indirect or low light, as direct sun can be detrimental. Fertilize very sparingly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Very light feeding; these plants are not heavy feeders. A highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the active growing season.
