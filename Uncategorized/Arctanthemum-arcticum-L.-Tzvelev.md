## Care Guide
The Arctic Daisy is a hardy plant that thrives in cool, open environments, requiring full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, so heavy fertilization should be avoided. Ensure good drainage to mimic its natural tundra habitat.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its native habitat.
