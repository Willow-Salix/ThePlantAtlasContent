## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northwestern California, USA (Klamath Mountains, North Coast Ranges, southern Cascade Range foothills) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade. Thrives with several hours of direct sunlight daily to encourage robust flowering. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent watering during its active growing season (late winter to late spring), allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Crucially, allow soil to dry out completely and keep dry during its summer dormancy period. |

## Introduction
Triteleia is a genus of monocotyledon flowering plants also known as triplet lilies. The 16 species are native to western North America, from British Columbia south to California and east to Wyoming and Arizona, with one species in northwestern Mexico. However, they are most common in California. They are perennial plants growing from a fibrous corm roughly spherical in shape. They get their name from the fact that all parts of their flowers come in threes.

## Care Guide
This bulbous plant thrives by mimicking its native Mediterranean climate, requiring full sun to partial shade and very well-draining soil. Provide regular water during its spring growth cycle, followed by a dry dormancy period in summer. It has minimal fertilizer requirements.

### Fertilizer
Has low nutrient needs, adapted to naturally lean soils. A light application of a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer once in early spring is sufficient, or it may not need any if grown in rich soil.
