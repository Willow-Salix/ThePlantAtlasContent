# Carolina Maronea Lichen

| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect light to partial shade; protect from direct, intense sunlight which can cause desiccation. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Carolina maronea lichen thrives in high humidity and indirect light, replicating its native humid subtropical forest conditions. Provide consistent moisture primarily through ambient humidity and occasional misting, as traditional watering and fertilization are not suitable for this organism.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from the atmosphere, rain, and substrate, and traditional plant fertilizers can be harmful.
