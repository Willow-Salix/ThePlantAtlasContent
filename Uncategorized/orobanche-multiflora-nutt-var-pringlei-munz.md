## 🧤 Care Instructions
This holoparasitic plant thrives by attaching to the roots of specific host plants in arid and semi-arid environments. Its cultivation is highly dependent on establishing a compatible host and replicating the host's native conditions, as it derives all water and nutrients from the host, making direct care difficult.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; this plant is a holoparasite and obtains all nutrients from its host plant. Fertilization is irrelevant for the parasite itself.
