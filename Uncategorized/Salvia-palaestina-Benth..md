| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate transitioning to Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats. |

## Introduction
Salvia () is the largest genus of plants in the sage family Lamiaceae, with just under 1,000 species of shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and annuals. Within the Lamiaceae, Salvia is part of the tribe Mentheae within the subfamily Nepetoideae.  One of several genera commonly referred to as sage, it includes two widely used herbs, Salvia officinalis (common sage, or just "sage") and Salvia rosmarinus (rosemary, formerly Rosmarinus officinalis). 
The genus is distributed throughout the Old World and the Americas (over 900 total species), with three distinct regions of diversity: Central America and South America (approximately 600 species); Central Asia and the Mediterranean (250 species); Eastern Asia (90 species).

## Care Guide
Palestine Sage thrives in full sun and well-draining, even poor, soil, reflecting its origins in open, rocky Mediterranean and arid scrubland environments. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, with caution against overwatering. Minimal fertilization is needed to maintain its robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soil. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary.
