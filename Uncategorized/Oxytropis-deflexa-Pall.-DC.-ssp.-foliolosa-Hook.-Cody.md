## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (including Alaska, Yukon, British Columbia, Alberta, and Rocky Mountains south to Montana, Wyoming, Colorado), and parts of northeastern Asia (Siberia) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, necessary for robust growth in its open, high-altitude native environment. |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent moisture during the growing season, but crucial to ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot; it tolerates drier conditions once established. |

## Introduction
Oxytropis is a genus of plants in the legume family. It includes over 600 species native to subarctic to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. It is one of three genera of plants known as locoweeds, and are notorious for being toxic to grazing animals. The other locoweed genus is the closely related Astragalus. Most oxtropis species are native to Eurasia and North America, but several species are native to the Arctic. These are hairy perennial plants which produce raceme inflorescences of pink, purple, white, or yellow flowers which are generally pea-like but have distinctive sharply beaked keels. The stems are leafless, the leaves being all basal. The plant produces legume pods containing the seeds.

## Care Guide
This cold-hardy plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native alpine and subalpine habitats. Provide moderate, consistent moisture during the growing season, ensuring excellent drainage to prevent rot. It requires minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to poor soils and nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Minimal, as it is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils and, being a legume, can fix atmospheric nitrogen.
