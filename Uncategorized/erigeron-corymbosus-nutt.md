## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient fleabane flourishes in full sun and well-drained conditions, mimicking its native semi-arid shrub-steppe environment. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering and very little fertilization, making it an ideal low-maintenance plant for xeric landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; it prefers lean to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring is optional.
