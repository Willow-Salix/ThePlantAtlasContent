## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (Appalachian Mountains) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (humid, cool with distinct seasons) |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect or dappled light; naturally found in the shaded understories or on tree trunks of dense forests. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity is crucial for this lichen, which absorbs moisture directly from the air, fog, and rainfall. No traditional watering is applicable; it is highly sensitive to desiccation. |

## Introduction
Cetraria is a genus of fruticose lichens that associate with green algae as photobionts. Most species are found at high latitudes, occurring on sand or heath, and are characterised by their "strap-like" form with spiny lobe edges. The lobes can range from narrow and linear to broader and flattened, often forming loose or densely packed cushions. Their distinctive spiny margins serve both a defensive role and aid in vegetative reproduction through fragmentation. The genus was created by Erik Acharius in 1803 and belongs to the large family Parmeliaceae. While originally a species-rich genus, taxonomic revisions since the 1960s have split many species into new genera, though the exact circumscription remains debated among lichenologists.
Several Cetraria species have cultural and economic importance, particularly C. islandica (Iceland moss), which has been widely used in European traditional medicine for treating digestive and respiratory ailments. This species was also historically important as a famine food in Northern Europe and continues to find applications in modern cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Cetraria species are also ecologically important, serving as indicators of air quality and climate change due to their sensitivity to environmental conditions and ability to accumulate various elements, including potentially toxic heavy metals and radioactive isotopes.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and pristine, pollutant-free air, typical of old-growth temperate forests. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere, rendering traditional watering and fertilization unnecessary and potentially detrimental. Key to its care is maintaining high ambient humidity and ensuring a clean environment.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens are extremely sensitive to external nutrient inputs and pollutants, deriving what they need from the atmosphere and substrate. Traditional fertilizers would be harmful.
