# Crusty Rock Tripe Lichen

*Omphalodiscus crustulosus (Ach.) Schol.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Scandinavia, Greenland, Russia, and mountainous areas like the Rocky Mountains and Alps. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High direct sun exposure, adapted to intense UV radiation, often on exposed rock surfaces in treeless environments. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture from high humidity, fog, and regular precipitation (rain, snowmelt); tolerates periods of desiccation between moisture events. |

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cold, bright conditions with high humidity and regular atmospheric moisture, typically found on exposed rocks. It requires no soil-based fertilization and is sensitive to excessive nutrients, making it highly specialized for its native, harsh environments.

### Fertilizer
No traditional soil-based fertilizer required. Nutrients are primarily obtained from air, dust, and minerals in the rock substrate; sensitive to nutrient overload.
