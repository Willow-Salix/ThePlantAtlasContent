## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and needs regular watering to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Provide moderate fertility with a balanced fertilizer during its active growing period. Adequate light and water are crucial for prolific flowering.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility; a balanced fertilizer or one slightly higher in phosphorus can be applied during the growing season to encourage blooms. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers which can promote foliage over flowers.
