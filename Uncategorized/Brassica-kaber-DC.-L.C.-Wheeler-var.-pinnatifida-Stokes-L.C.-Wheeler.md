## Introduction
Rhamphospermum arvense, (syns. Brassica arvensis and Sinapis arvensis) the charlock, sometimes also called field mustard, wild mustard, or charlock mustard, is an annual or winter annual plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is found in the fields of North Africa, Asia, Europe, and some other areas where it has been transported and naturalised. Pieris rapae, the small white butterfly, and Pieris napi, the green veined white butterfly, are significant consumers of charlock during their larval stages.

## Care Guide
Charlock is a hardy annual that prefers full sun and moderate watering. It is highly adaptable to various soil types and typically requires minimal fertilization, reflecting its nature as a resilient field weed. Ensure good drainage and adequate sunlight for best results.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average garden soil and doesn't typically require heavy fertilization, but benefits from general-purpose nutrients in poorer soils.
