## Care Guide
This resilient palm thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, showing high tolerance to drought and coastal conditions once established. Water regularly during dry spells but allow the soil to dry out between waterings. Minimal fertilization is required.

### Fertilizer
Low fertility needs. A slow-release palm fertilizer can be applied once or twice a year, especially in nutrient-poor soils, but it often thrives without heavy feeding.
