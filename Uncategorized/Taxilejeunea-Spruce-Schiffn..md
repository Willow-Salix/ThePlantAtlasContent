# Taxilejeunea (Spruce) Schiffn.

*Taxilejeunea (Spruce) Schiffn.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pantropical, widespread in humid tropical regions including South America (e.g., Amazon basin), Central America, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest (warm, consistently high humidity, frequent rainfall) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. As epiphytic or epiphyllous bryophytes, they typically grow in the shaded understory or on other plants beneath a dense canopy. Direct sunlight will scorch their delicate tissues. |
| **Watering** | Consistent high humidity is paramount. Keep the growing medium or substrate consistently moist but never waterlogged. Frequent misting or cultivation in a terrarium/vivarium setup is essential to provide the high ambient moisture they require. They must not be allowed to dry out. |

## Care Guide
Taxilejeunea requires a highly humid, tropical rainforest-like environment with low to moderate indirect light. Ensure the substrate is consistently moist and maintain high ambient humidity, avoiding direct sun and excessive fertilization. Good air circulation is also important to prevent fungal issues.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. In their natural habitat, they obtain nutrients from rainwater and decaying organic matter. If fertilizing, use an extremely dilute liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/8 to 1/4 strength) very infrequently, perhaps once every 2-3 months during periods of active growth.
