## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Andes mountains of Chile and Argentina |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, especially preferring full sun as it matures for best growth. |
| **Watering** | Needs consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native habitat's high rainfall and snowmelt. Avoid waterlogging, but do not allow the soil to dry out completely, particularly for young plants. |

## Introduction
Araucaria araucana, commonly called the pewen, monkey-puzzle, pehuen or piñonero, is an evergreen tree belonging to the family Araucariaceae and growing to a height of 30–40 m (98–131 ft) and a trunk diameter of 1–1.5 m (3.3–4.9 ft). Native to central and southern Chile and western Argentina, it is the hardiest species in the conifer genus Araucaria.
Because of the prevalence of similar species in ancient prehistory, it is sometimes called a 'living fossil'. It is also the official tree of Chile and of the neighboring Argentine province of Neuquén. The IUCN changed its conservation status to Endangered in 2013, because logging, forest fires, and grazing have caused its population to dwindle.

## Care Guide
The Monkey Puzzle Tree thrives in cool, moist, well-draining conditions with ample sunlight, particularly as it matures. Ensure consistent soil moisture without waterlogging, and provide light fertilization only when necessary for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, especially for young trees. Mature, established trees often require minimal fertilization if grown in suitable soil.
