## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Hemisphere temperate and boreal oceanic regions, including Western Europe and parts of North America |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate, indirect light; thrives in dappled shade and avoids direct sun exposure. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and frequent moisture from rain or mist, but good air circulation is essential to prevent stagnant conditions. |

## Introduction
Pannaria is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Pannariaceae. These lichens form leaf-like, scaly, or crusty patches that typically arrange themselves in loose rosettes on tree bark in humid forests. Most species partner with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, though some contain green algae instead. The genus was established in 1828 and now includes about 80 recognized species found worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.

## Care Guide
Matted lichen thrives in cool, highly humid environments with consistent indirect light and good air circulation. It requires regular atmospheric moisture, absorbing water from rain and mist, and does not need traditional fertilization, being sensitive to pollutants.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air, rainfall, and substrate and are sensitive to excess nutrients and pollution.
