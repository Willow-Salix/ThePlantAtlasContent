## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of Asia (e.g., Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia) and Africa. |
| **Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Dry Forests, Savannahs, and Scrublands. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers bright, direct light for at least 4-6 hours daily, typical of open scrublands and forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Water regularly during the growing season (warm months), allowing the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce frequency significantly in cooler or dormant periods, allowing the soil to dry out almost completely to mimic natural dry seasons. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Pergularia thrives in bright, direct sunlight and tolerates periods of drought. Water consistently during warmer months, letting the soil dry between waterings, and reduce significantly in cooler periods. Provide moderate fertilization during its active growth phase to encourage flowering and robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength. No fertilizer is typically needed during fall and winter dormancy.
