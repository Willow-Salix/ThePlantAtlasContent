## 🌱 Overview
Navarretia is a genus of flowering plants related to the phloxes and the gilias. This is one genus of plants, among others, which are sometimes called pincushion plants. It includes 45 species native to the Americas. In North America they range from western Canada through the western and west-central United States to northwestern Mexico, and to Ohio and Pennsylvania. In South America they range through Argentina and Chile.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun with consistently wet to saturated soil during its growing phase in spring and early summer. It is essential to provide a dry dormancy period in the hotter months, mimicking its native vernal pool habitat. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; vernal pool environments are often nutrient-limited. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
