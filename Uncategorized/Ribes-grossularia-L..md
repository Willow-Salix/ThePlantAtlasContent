Gooseberry ( GOOSS-berr-ee or  GOOZ-berr-ee (American and northern British) or  GUUZ-bər-ee (southern British)) is a common name for many species of Ribes (which also includes currants), as well as a large number of plants of similar appearance, and also several unrelated plants (see List of gooseberries).

## Care Guide
Gooseberries thrive in cool, temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade for optimal fruit production. They require consistently moist, well-drained soil with regular watering during dry spells. An annual application of balanced fertilizer in spring supports healthy growth and fruiting.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced fertilizer applied in early spring before new growth to support its fruiting demands and reflect its natural soil conditions.
