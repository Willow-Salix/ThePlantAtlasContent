## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Subarctic North America (Alaska, Canada, Greenland), Russian Far East |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subarctic Boreal |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Needs bright, open exposure during the growing season. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial, especially during the growing season, but requires excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Avoid drought. |

## Introduction
Vahlodea is a monotypic genus of plants in the grass family. The only known species is Vahlodea atropurpurea (Wahlenb.) Fr.
Its native range is the subarctic (such as Greenland), to temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere. From (Europe within; Finland,  North European Russia, Norway and Sweden,) to Asia within (Japan, Kamchatka, Kuril Islands, Magadan and Taiwan,) and in North America (within the Canadian provinces of; Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Québec and Yukon and within the USA states of; Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, California, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Wyoming,) and also southern South America (within Argentina and Chile).
The genus name of Vahlodea is in honour of Jens Vahl (1796–1854), a Danish botanist and pharmacist. The Latin specific epithet of atropurpurea means "dark-purple coloured".
Both the genus and the sole species were first described and published in Bot. Not. (1842) Vol.141 on page 178 in 1842.
The genus is recognized by the United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service, and they list Vahlodea atropurpurea as the known species.
It was thought to be a synonym of Deschampsia P. Beauv., but a 2007 molecular phylogenetic study supported the recognition of Avenella and Vahlodea.

## Care Guide
This alpine grass thrives in cool, bright conditions with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimic its native environment by providing full to partial sun and avoiding both drought and waterlogging. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Adapted to nutrient-poor alpine soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
