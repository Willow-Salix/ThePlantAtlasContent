## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in cool, exposed conditions with full sun and excellent drainage. It requires consistently moist soil, especially during its short growing season, but is highly sensitive to waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal or avoided, mimicking its native lean, rocky habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none; native alpine soils are typically lean and nutrient-poor, preferring a gritty, unfertilized substrate.
