## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Mediterranean region (e.g., Turkey, parts of Italy and Greece) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; thrives with ample sunlight exposure in its natural open habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; keep soil consistently moist but well-drained, especially during active growth. Tolerates periods of drought once established, adapting to dry Mediterranean summers. |

## Introduction
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## Care Guide
Petrisavi's Clover, native to the Mediterranean, thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. It prefers consistent moisture during its active growing season but is tolerant of drought once established, reflecting its native climate. Due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities, fertilization needs are minimal.

### Fertilizer
Low; as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it naturally enriches the soil and generally does not require nitrogen fertilizer. A balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer may be used in exceptionally poor soils.
