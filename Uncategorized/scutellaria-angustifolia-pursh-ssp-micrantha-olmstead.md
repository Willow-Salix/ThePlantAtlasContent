## 🌱 Overview
Scutellaria is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. They are known commonly as skullcaps. The generic name is derived from the Latin scutella, meaning "a small dish, tray or platter", or "little dish", referring to the shape of the calyx. The common name alludes to the resemblance of the same structure to "miniature medieval helmets". The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution, with species occurring nearly worldwide, mainly in temperate regions.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Native to the temperate woodlands and grasslands of Western North America, Narrowleaf Skullcap prefers full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering during its active growth season but becomes quite drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization is rarely needed, as it thrives in lean to average soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; it thrives in lean to average soils. Rich soils can lead to leggy growth.
