### *Casearia aculeata Jacq.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical America, encompassing regions from Mexico through Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest to Tropical Moist Forest, often found in secondary growth or forest margins. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers bright, indirect light to partial sun. It can tolerate full sun exposure, especially if kept well-watered, but should be protected from the most intense, scorching midday sun. Avoid deep shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture during its active growing season, characteristic of tropical rainfall patterns. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot, and reduce watering frequency significantly during cooler, dormant periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Casearia is a plant genus in the family Salicaceae. The genus was included in the Flacourtiaceae under the Cronquist system of angiosperm classification, and earlier in the Samydaceae.
They are sometimes employed as honey plants, notably C. decandra and C. sylvestris. The latter species is occasionally used as food by the caterpillars of the two-barred flasher (Astraptes fulgerator). Several species are becoming rare due to deforestation. Some appear close to extinction, and C. quinduensis of Colombia and C. tinifolia from Mauritius seem to be extinct since some time in the 20th century and about 1976, respectively.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a plant native to tropical American dry to moist forests, Rabo de Ranton thrives in bright, indirect to partial sun and requires regular watering to maintain consistently moist, but not waterlogged, soil during its active growth. Provide a balanced fertilizer throughout spring and summer, ensuring well-draining conditions to mimic its natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from regular fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the spring and summer growing season. Reduce or cease feeding during fall and winter months when growth slows.
