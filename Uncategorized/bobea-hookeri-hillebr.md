## 🌱 Overview
Bobea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It includes five species, four of which are endemic to Hawaii and one to eastern Queensland in Australia. Bobea was named for Jean-Baptiste Bobe-Moreau by Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupré in 1830 in his book Voyage de l'Uranie.
The wood of Bobea is hard, wearable, and yellow. It was used for the gunwales of Polynesian voyaging canoes. The gunwales of modern canoes are sometimes painted yellow in imitation of the wood that is no longer widely available.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian native thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical forest home, preferring bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Maintain high humidity and fertilize moderately during the warmer months to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer), reducing or stopping in fall and winter.
