## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South-west Western Australia |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Woodland |

| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring less water during prolonged dry spells. |

## Introduction
Melaleuca () is a genus of nearly 300 species of plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, commonly known as paperbarks, honey-myrtles, bottlebrushes or tea-trees (although the last name is also applied to species of Leptospermum). They range in size from small shrubs that rarely grow to more than 16 m (52 ft) high, to trees up to 35 m (115 ft). Their flowers generally occur in groups, forming a "head" or "spike" resembling a brush used for cleaning bottles, containing up to 80 individual flowers.
Melaleucas are an important food source for nectarivorous insects, birds, and mammals. Many are popular garden plants, either for their attractive flowers or as dense screens and a few have economic value for producing fencing and oils such as "tea tree" oil. Most melaleucas are endemic to Australia, with a few also occurring in Malesia. Seven are endemic to New Caledonia, and one is found only on Australia's Lord Howe Island. 
Melaleucas are found in a wide variety of habitats. Many are adapted for life in swamps and boggy places, while others thrive in the poorest of sandy soils or on the edge of saltpans. Some have a wide distribution and are common, whilst others are rare and endangered. Land clearing, exotic myrtle rust, and especially draining and clearing of swamps threaten many species.

## Care Guide
Reflecting its origins in the Mediterranean climate of Western Australia, Dotted Melaleuca thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate water, and prefers nutrient-poor conditions, making low-phosphorus fertilizers ideal.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. If fertilized, use a slow-release, low-phosphorus formula specifically designed for native Australian plants, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.
