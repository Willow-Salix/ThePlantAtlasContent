## Care Guide
This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments characteristic of its native semi-arid montane habitats. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate (adapted to lean soils; excessive fertilization is typically unnecessary)
