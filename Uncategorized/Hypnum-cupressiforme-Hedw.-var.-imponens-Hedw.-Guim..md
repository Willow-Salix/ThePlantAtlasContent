| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Cosmopolitan in temperate and humid subtropical regions, including Europe, North America, Asia, and Australasia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forests and Humid Subtropical Woodlands (often found on logs, rocks, or soil, under tree canopy). |
| **Sunlight** | Low to Partial Light. Prefers indirect light or shade; direct, intense sunlight should be avoided. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist conditions, but not waterlogged. High ambient humidity is crucial for its health and growth. |

## Introduction
Hypnum cupressiforme, the cypress-leaved plaitmoss or hypnum moss, is a common and widespread species of moss belonging to the genus Hypnum. It is found in all continents except Antarctica and occurs in a wide variety of habitats and climatic zones. It typically grows on tree trunks, logs, walls, rocks and other surfaces. It prefers acidic environments and is fairly tolerant of pollution. It was formerly used as a filling for pillows and mattresses; the association with sleep is the origin of the genus name Hypnum (from Greek Hypnos).

It is a small to medium-sized moss about 2–10 cm long. It is pleurocarpous, having prostrate, creeping stems which form smooth, dense mats. The stems are branched and covered in overlapping leaves giving the impression of a cypress tree. The stem leaves are long and thin measuring 1.0-2.1 mm by 0.3-0.6 mm. They are concave and sickle-shaped, tapering towards the tip. The branch leaves are smaller and narrower than those on the stems.  The moss produces short, cylindrical and slightly curved capsules which contain the spores. The capsules are 1.7-2.4 mm long and have a lid-like operculum measuring 0.6-0.9 mm. They are borne on reddish-brown stalks which are 1-2.5 cm long. The moss is dioicous, having separate male and female plants. Hypnum cupressiforme is a highly variable species and numerous varieties have been described.

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in consistently moist, shaded environments, mimicking its native habitat on forest floors or rocks. Ensure high humidity and never allow it to dry out completely, but avoid standing water. Fertilization is generally unnecessary due to its low nutrient requirements.

### Fertilizer
Very Low. Mosses generally do not require fertilization; excessive nutrients can be detrimental and are rarely beneficial.
