## Introduction
Dalea  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as prairie clover or indigo bush. Its name honors English apothecary Samuel Dale (1659–1739). They are native to the Western hemisphere, where they are distributed from Canada to Argentina. Nearly half of the known species are endemic to Mexico. Two species of Dalea (Dalea ornata and Dalea searlsiae) have been considered for rangeland restoration.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native Texas grasslands. It requires minimal watering once established due to its drought tolerance. Fertilization is generally not necessary, as it is a nitrogen-fixing legume.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen in the soil. Excess fertilizer can be detrimental.
