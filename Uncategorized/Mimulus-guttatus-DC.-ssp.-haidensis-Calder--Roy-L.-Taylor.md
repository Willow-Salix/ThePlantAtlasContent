## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Haida Gwaii (formerly Queen Charlotte Islands), British Columbia, Canada |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it grows in open, wet areas, suggesting it tolerates full sun if moisture is abundant, but partial shade is beneficial in warmer climates to prevent drying out. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its natural habitat along stream banks, seeps, and wet meadows; never allow the soil to dry out. |

## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
