## Introduction
Wisteria frutescens (common names American wisteria, swamp wisteria, Mississippi wisteria, and Atlantic wisteria) is a woody, deciduous, perennial climbing vine, one of various wisterias of the family Fabaceae. It is native to the wet forests and stream banks of the southeastern United States, with a range stretching from the states of Virginia to Texas (Northeast Texas Piney Woods) and extending southeast through Florida, also north to Iowa, Michigan, and New York.

## Care Guide
American Wisteria thrives in full sun with consistently moist soil, mimicking its native habitat along stream banks in the Southeastern US. Provide moderate, balanced fertilization, ensuring it's not overly high in nitrogen to promote abundant flowering rather than just foliage.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring. As a legume, it fixes some nitrogen, so avoid excessive nitrogen which can promote foliage over flowers.
