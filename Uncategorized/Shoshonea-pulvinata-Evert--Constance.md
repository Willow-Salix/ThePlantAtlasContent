## Care Guide
To care for the Shoshone Carrot, provide full sun and extremely well-draining soil, simulating its native limestone cliff habitat. Ensure consistent moisture during the growing season while strictly avoiding waterlogging, and apply fertilizer sparingly due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor alpine environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as alpine soils are typically nutrient-poor. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is sufficient.
