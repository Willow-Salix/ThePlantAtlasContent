## Care Guide
This alpine perennial requires full sun and thrives in well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native high-altitude environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing to prevent leggy growth and maintain its compact form.

### Fertilizer
Very low. This plant thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. Fertilization is generally unnecessary and can lead to leggy growth.
