## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain West regions of the United States (e.g., California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane (Subalpine Meadows and Open Woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. In its native habitat, it grows in open woodlands or meadows, suggesting it can handle significant light but may benefit from some afternoon shade in warmer exposures. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist during its active growth period in spring. Its native moist meadows suggest it does not tolerate drying out when growing. Allow for some drying during summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Claytonia (spring beauty) is a genus of flowering plants native to Asia, North America, and Central America. The vitamin-rich leaves can be eaten raw or cooked, and the tubers can be prepared like potatoes.

## Care Guide
Claytonia triphylla thrives in consistently moist conditions during its spring growth, mimicking its native subalpine meadows. Provide bright indirect light to partial sun and a light feeding during this active phase. It is an ephemeral plant, often going dormant and requiring less water during summer.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during its active spring growth period. Over-fertilization is generally not needed.
