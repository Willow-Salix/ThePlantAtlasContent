## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Maui, Hawaiian Islands, USA |
| **Climate** | Subalpine Shrubland (mesic to dry) |
| **Sunlight** | Requires high sun exposure, consistent with its native habitat on open lava flows and exposed subalpine shrublands. Full sun is ideal, though some partial shade might be tolerated in very hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Needs consistent moisture, but excellent drainage is paramount due to its growth on lava flows. Water regularly, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot, mimicking frequent rainfall or fog with rapid runoff. |

## Introduction
Dubautia or na'ena'e is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. The genus was named after Joseph Eugène DuBaut (1796–1832), an officer in the French Navy who participated in Freycinet's expedition.
The entire genus is endemic to Hawaii. It contains more species than the other two genera in the silversword alliance, including cushion plants, shrubs, trees, and lianas.

## Care Guide
Provide this plant with high sun exposure and ensure it has well-draining soil to mimic its native lava flow habitat. Water consistently, allowing for quick drainage, and fertilize minimally to support its natural adaptation to less nutrient-rich environments.

### Fertilizer
As it grows in volcanic soils which can be nutrient-poor, it likely requires minimal fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season would suffice, or none if soil is amended with compost.
