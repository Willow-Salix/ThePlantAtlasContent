## Introduction
Chilopsis is a monotypic genus of flowering plants containing the single species Chilopsis linearis. It is known commonly as desert willow or desert-willow because of its willow-like leaves, but it is not a true willow – being instead a member of the catalpa family.
It is a shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States and Mexico. It is commonly seen in washes and along riverbanks.

## Care Guide
The Desert Willow thrives in full sun and dry conditions, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping. It requires infrequent, deep watering once established and generally needs minimal fertilization, adapting well to poor desert soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not required once established in suitable soil; if needed, a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring.
