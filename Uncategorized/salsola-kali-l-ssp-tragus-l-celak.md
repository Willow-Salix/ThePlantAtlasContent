## 🧤 Care Instructions
Russian Thistle is an extremely resilient plant that thrives in full sun and requires very little water, tolerating severe drought conditions. It prefers poor, well-draining soil and typically needs no fertilization to flourish. The most critical care involves avoiding overwatering, which can quickly lead to root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to poor, disturbed soils and does not require rich nutrients or regular fertilization.
