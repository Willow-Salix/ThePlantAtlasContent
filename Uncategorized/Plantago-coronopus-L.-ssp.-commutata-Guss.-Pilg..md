## Care Guide
Buck's-horn Plantain thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its Mediterranean native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and prefers drier conditions over waterlogging. Fertilization needs are minimal, as it is adapted to poor to average soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; this plant thrives in nutrient-poor to average soils and generally does not require frequent fertilization. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once a year in spring, if desired, is sufficient.
