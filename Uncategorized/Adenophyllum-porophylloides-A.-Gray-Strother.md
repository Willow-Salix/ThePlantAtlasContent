## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California) and Northwestern Mexico (Baja California, Sonora), specifically the Sonoran Desert. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun for optimal growth and flowering, mimicking its native open desert habitat with intense, direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. Overwatering is detrimental. |

## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full sun and demands very infrequent watering, being highly drought-tolerant. It prefers lean soil and generally needs little to no supplemental fertilization, making it a low-maintenance, arid-adapted plant.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor desert soils. If desired, apply a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once annually in spring.
