## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Kauaʻi, Hawaiian Islands |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to indirect bright light. Avoid direct, harsh sunlight, especially during midday, as it grows in the understory of dense forests. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged. Requires high humidity, so regular misting or placement near a humidifier is beneficial. Water frequently enough to prevent the soil from drying out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Psychotria is a large genus of flowering plants in the coffee family Rubiaceae, with over 1,600 species. The genus has a pantropical distribution and members of the genus are small understorey trees in tropical forests. Some species are endangered or facing extinction due to deforestation, especially species of central Africa and the Pacific.
Many species, including Psychotria viridis, produce the psychedelic chemical dimethyltryptamine (DMT).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian Kōpiko thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical wet forest understory. Provide consistent moisture, high humidity, and indirect bright light to ensure healthy growth. Fertilize moderately during warmer months to support its natural vigor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10) during the active growing season (spring and summer), typically every 4-6 weeks. Reduce or stop fertilizing in fall and winter.
