## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and demanding consistently wet to moist soil conditions, often tolerating shallow standing water. It prefers rich, organic soil, making it well-suited for pond edges, bog gardens, or perpetually moist garden beds.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in moderately rich, organic-heavy soils. Fertilization is generally not heavily required if planted in fertile, mucky soil; otherwise, a balanced liquid feed can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
