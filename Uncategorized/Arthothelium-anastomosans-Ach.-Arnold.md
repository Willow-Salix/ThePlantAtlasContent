## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across humid temperate and subtropical regions, including parts of North America (especially Eastern US, Pacific Northwest), Europe (particularly Western Europe), and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate to Subtropical Moist Forests, often in oceanic or consistently damp environments. |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; thrives in partial to full shade, protected from direct sunlight, mimicking its growth under a forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity (70-90%) and frequent misting (daily to several times a week) to absorb moisture. Avoid standing water but ensure damp conditions. |

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in high humidity and low, indirect light conditions, characteristic of its native humid forest habitats. It requires frequent misting to absorb moisture and does not need traditional fertilization, deriving nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain necessary trace nutrients from rain, air, and the substrate on which they grow.
