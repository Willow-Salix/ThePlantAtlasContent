## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada) and Northwestern Mexico (Sonora, Baja California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun; requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Thrives in intense, unobstructed light typical of desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Mimic sparse desert rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Parkinsonia , also Cercidium , is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae. It contains about 12 species that are native to semi-desert regions of Africa and the Americas. The name of the genus honors English apothecary and botanist John Parkinson (1567–1650).
They are large shrubs or small trees growing to 5–12 m (16–39 ft) tall, dry season deciduous, with sparse, open, thorny crowns and green bark. The leaves are pinnate, usually bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets; they are only borne for a relatively short time after rains, with much of the photosynthesis carried out by the green twigs and branches. The flowers are symmetrical or nearly so, with five yellow or white petals. The fruit is a pod containing several seeds.
Most American species are known by the common name of palo verde or paloverde, derived from the Spanish words meaning "green tree". This name is given due to its characteristic green trunk. The palo verde (not species-specific) is the state tree of Arizona.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Yellow Paloverde thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, mirroring its arid desert origins. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings and avoid over-fertilization. This plant is highly adapted to drought and poor soils, making it very low-maintenance in appropriate conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils; over-fertilization can be detrimental. A very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring, or none at all, is sufficient.
