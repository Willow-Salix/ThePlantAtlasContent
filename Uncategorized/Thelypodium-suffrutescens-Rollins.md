## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in a Mediterranean-like environment with plenty of sun and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring moderate watering only during its cooler growing season and very little during the hot summer months. Fertilization should be minimal due to its adaptation to low-nutrient soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor serpentine soils. Minimal or no fertilization is generally required.
