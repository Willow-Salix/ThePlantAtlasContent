## Introduction
Bidens is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. The genus include roughly 230 species which are distributed worldwide. Despite their global distribution, the systematics and taxonomy of the genus has been described as complicated and unorganized. The common names beggarticks, black jack, burr marigolds, cobbler's pegs, Spanish needles, stickseeds, tickseeds and tickseed sunflowers refer to the fruits of the plants, most of which are bristly and barbed. The generic name refers to the same character; Bidens comes from the Latin bi ("two") and dens ("tooth").

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native thrives in bright, open environments, requiring full sun to partial sun exposure. Provide consistent moisture, allowing the soil surface to dry slightly between waterings, and apply fertilizer sparingly as it tolerates moderate nutrient levels. Its adaptability makes it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the main growing season, or omitted if soil is naturally rich.
