## Care Guide
Agropyron Tauri is a hardy perennial grass that prefers full sun and well-drained soil, tolerating drought conditions once established. Mimic its native steppe climate by providing infrequent, deep watering and requiring only minimal fertilization. Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor soils; a light, balanced fertilizer application in spring, if needed, is usually sufficient.
