## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic regions, including Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, Novaya Zemlya, and other high-latitude circumpolar areas. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure, often on open rock faces, accustomed to low sun angles but intense UV radiation. Can tolerate periods of lower light during overcast conditions typical of its native Arctic environment. |
| **Watering** | Requires distinct cycles of thorough rehydration followed by complete drying out. Mimic meltwater from snow and occasional rainfall. Highly tolerant of prolonged desiccation. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
This Arctic lichen thrives in cold, exposed conditions, requiring high light and distinct cycles of hydration and desiccation. Avoid traditional fertilizers, as it naturally acquires nutrients from its environment and is sensitive to pollution, preferring a lean, clean environment.

### Fertilizer
No external fertilization is typically required or recommended. Lichens derive nutrients from the atmosphere and substrate; they are sensitive to nutrient pollution and excess nutrients.
