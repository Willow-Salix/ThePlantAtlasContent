## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (including Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, California) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open desert and scrubland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low; highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to completely dry out between waterings to mimic its native arid environment. |

## Introduction
Pectis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1759.
The name is derived from the Latin word pecten, meaning "comb." It refers to the marginally-bristled leaves or the pappus form.  These plants vary in appearance but they usually bear yellow daisy-like flower heads. Members of the genus are known generally as cinchweeds (current usage) or chinchweeds (older name).
They are native to the Americas, including the West Indies.

## Care Guide
Lemonscent is a robust desert plant that requires full sun exposure and minimal water once established, reflecting its arid native climate. It thrives in poor, well-draining soils and does not typically need any fertilization for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
