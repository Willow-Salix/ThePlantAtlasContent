## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern California, specifically the inner California Coast Ranges, Tehachapi Mountains, Transverse Ranges, and Peninsular Ranges. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Scrubland (montane foothills) |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun, meaning at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day, reflecting its native open and exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; requires infrequent to moderate watering during its active growth period in spring, and minimal to no water during its typical summer dormancy. Excellent drainage is essential. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Chalk Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining, often calcareous soils, mimicking its native Mediterranean chaparral environment. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and, being a nitrogen-fixing plant, requires minimal to no fertilization. Focus on ample sunlight and excellent drainage for best results.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally requires no supplemental nitrogen fertilizer. If soil is exceptionally poor, a low-phosphorus, low-nitrogen fertilizer can be applied very sparingly, but is often unnecessary.
