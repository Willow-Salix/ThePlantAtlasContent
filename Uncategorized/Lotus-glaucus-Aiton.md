## Care Guide
This plant thrives in sunny, dry conditions typical of its native Canary Islands. Provide full sun and water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings to mimic its natural arid environment. It requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring is sufficient, or avoid if soil is naturally fertile.
