## Introduction
Erythronium, the fawn lily, trout lily, dog's-tooth violet or adder's tongue, is a genus of Eurasian and North American plants in the lily family, most closely related to tulips. The name Erythronium derives from Ancient Greek ἐρυθρός (eruthrós) "red" in Greek, referring to the red flowers of E. dens-canis. Of all the established species, most live in North America; only six species are found in Europe and Asia.

## Care Guide
This spring ephemeral thrives in partial shade with consistently moist soil during its active growth period in early spring. It prefers well-drained, organically rich soil and requires a dry dormancy period through summer to prevent bulb rot. Avoid overwatering once foliage begins to yellow.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer in early spring as new growth emerges. Prefers organically rich soil.
