## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant perennial thrives in its native Western North American dry woodland and scrubland habitats. Provide full sun and excellent drainage, watering deeply but infrequently once established. It requires minimal fertilization, preferring lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant prefers lean, well-drained soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all in good garden soil, is sufficient.
