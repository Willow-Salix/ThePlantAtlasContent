| **Native Origin** | Central and Northern Florida, USA, extending into parts of southeastern Georgia |

| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; it thrives in open to semi-open woodland and scrubby flatwood environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, particularly during dry spells, with well-drained soil. It tolerates some drought once established but prefers consistent moisture in warm months. |

## Introduction
Vaccinium  vack-SIN-ee-əm is a common and widespread genus of shrubs or dwarf shrubs in the heath family (Ericaceae). The fruits of many species are eaten by humans and some are of commercial importance, including the cranberry, blueberry, bilberry (whortleberry), lingonberry (cowberry), and huckleberry. Like many other heath plants, they are restricted to acidic soils.

## Care Guide
The Florida Huckleberry thrives in acidic, well-drained soils under full sun to partial shade, mimicking its native pine flatwood and sandhill habitats. It requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods, and benefits from sparse application of an acid-specific fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. It prefers acidic soils, so use an acid-specific fertilizer sparingly, ideally in early spring.
