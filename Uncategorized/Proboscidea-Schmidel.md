## Introduction
Proboscidea is a genus of flowering plant in the family Martyniaceae, some of whose species are known as devil's claw, devil's horn, ram's horn, or unicorn plant. The plants produce long, hooked seed pods. The hooks catch on the feet of animals, and as the animals walk, the pods are ground or crushed open, dispersing the seeds. The name devil's claw is shared with the South African plant Harpagophytum procumbens.

## Care Guide
The Unicorn Plant thrives in full sun, mimicking its native arid to semi-arid environments. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization during its active growth. Ensure well-drained soil for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season.
