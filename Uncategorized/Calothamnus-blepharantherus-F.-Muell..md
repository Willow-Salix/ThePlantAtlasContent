## Introduction
Calothamnus sanguineus, commonly known as silky-leaved blood flower, is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia.

It was the first of its genus to be formally described.

## Care Guide
This Western Australian native thrives in full sun and very well-drained, low-nutrient soil. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization suitable for Australian natives.

### Fertilizer
Low nutrient requirements; avoid high phosphorus fertilizers. Use slow-release, native-specific formulations only if necessary.
