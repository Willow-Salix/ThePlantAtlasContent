## Care Guide
Annual Semaphoregrass is a native of California and southern Oregon's seasonal wetlands and vernal pools. It requires full sun and abundant water, often thriving in areas with standing water during its active growth phase in spring. As an annual, it completes its life cycle and dries out with the onset of summer.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in typical wetland soils; excessive fertilization is unnecessary.
