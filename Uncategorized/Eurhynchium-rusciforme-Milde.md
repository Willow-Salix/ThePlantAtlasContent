## Care Guide
This aquatic moss thrives in cool, constantly moist to submerged conditions with low light to partial shade, mimicking its natural streambank habitat. It requires high humidity and very minimal nutrient supplementation, relying on ambient minerals for growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none; mosses extract nutrients from water and air, high fertilizer concentrations can be detrimental.
