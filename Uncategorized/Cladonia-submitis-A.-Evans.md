## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (primarily Eastern U.S.), Europe (Scandinavia, Central), and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forest and Heathland |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright indirect light to partial shade. Can tolerate some morning sun but should be protected from harsh afternoon sun to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires high ambient humidity, dew, or regular misting rather than soil watering. It is desiccation-tolerant, but active growth occurs during moist periods. Ensure good air circulation. |

## Introduction
Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations.
Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).
Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.
Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dunes, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.
Larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes continuella, feed on Cladonia species.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in humid, well-ventilated conditions with bright indirect light. Do not fertilize or attempt to 'water' it like a typical plant; instead, focus on maintaining high ambient humidity and occasional misting to encourage growth while allowing for dry periods.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens are self-sufficient and obtain nutrients from atmospheric deposition. Fertilizers designed for vascular plants are detrimental.
