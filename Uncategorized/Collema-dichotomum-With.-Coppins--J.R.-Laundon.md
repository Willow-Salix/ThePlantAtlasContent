## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America, often in areas with high humidity. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forests and Woodlands, particularly those with high ambient humidity or proximity to coastlines. |
| **Sunlight** | Low to partial indirect light; prefers shaded or semi-shaded conditions away from direct sun to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires high ambient humidity and frequent wetting or misting to absorb water and become metabolically active, allowing for periods of dryness between rehydration. |

## Introduction
Collema (jelly lichen) is a genus of lichens in the family Collemataceae. The photobiont is the cyanobacterium genus Nostoc. Species in this genus typically grow on nutrient-rich bark or somewhat siliceous or calcareous rocks in humid environments.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with low to partial indirect light. It requires regular wetting or high ambient humidity to remain active, but can tolerate periods of dryness. Avoid any external fertilizers or pollutants as lichens are very sensitive.

### Fertilizer
Not required; lichens are highly sensitive to external nutrients and pollutants, obtaining necessary elements primarily from air and rainwater.
