## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Appalachian Mountains), Europe, and East Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Humid Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to indirect bright light, avoiding intense direct sun. Prefers dappled light conditions typical of a forest understory or canopy edge. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity is crucial. Requires regular hydration from rainfall, fog, or mist. Tolerates drying between rehydration periods, but prolonged dryness prevents metabolic activity. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Haematomma is a genus of crustose lichens established by Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo in 1852. It is the sole genus in the Haematommataceae, a family circumscribed by Josef Hafellner in 1984. Commonly called bloodstain lichens, the species assigned to this genus are widely distributed in tropical and temperate areas.
The genus name Haematomma means "bloody eye", a reference to the color of the lichen's apothecia.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in humid, temperate to subtropical forest environments, preferring partial shade and high atmospheric moisture. It obtains nutrients from the air and substrate, thus requiring no traditional fertilization. Regular hydration through mist or rainfall is essential for its activity, though it tolerates periods of desiccation.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required. Lichens absorb trace nutrients directly from the air and substrate. High nutrient levels can be detrimental. Clean air and substrate are more important.
