## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, bright conditions with well-draining soil, mimicking its native alpine tundra habitat. Provide moderate water during its growing season and avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-sparse environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Accustomed to nutrient-poor soils; a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once annually or skipped if soil is naturally fertile.
