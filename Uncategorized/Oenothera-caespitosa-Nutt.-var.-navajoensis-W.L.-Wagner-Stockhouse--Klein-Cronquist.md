## Care Guide
The Navajo Tufted Evening Primrose is a desert-adapted plant that requires full sun and exceptionally well-draining soil. It is very drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering once established, and thrives with minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
