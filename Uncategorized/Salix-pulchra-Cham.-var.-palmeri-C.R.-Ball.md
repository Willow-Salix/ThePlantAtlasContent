## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Alaska and northwestern Canada, specifically subarctic and alpine regions. |
| **Climate** | Subarctic Wet Tundra / Alpine Boglands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is ideal, tolerating partial sun. |
| **Watering** | High. Soil must be kept consistently moist to wet, never allowing it to dry out, mimicking boggy conditions. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This subarctic willow thrives in consistently wet, bog-like conditions under full sun. It is highly tolerant of cold temperatures and requires minimal fertilization, adapting well to nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile, often acidic, soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring might be beneficial, but over-fertilization should be avoided.
