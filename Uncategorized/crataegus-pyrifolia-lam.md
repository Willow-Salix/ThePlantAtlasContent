## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy temperate tree thrives in full sun with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native woodland edge environment. It generally requires moderate watering and light fertilization, adapting well to a range of conditions once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring if soil is poor or the plant shows signs of nutrient deficiency. Established plants in healthy soil often require minimal additional feeding.
