## Care Guide
Thriving in harsh desert conditions, Spreading Pygmyleaf demands full sun and extremely infrequent watering, tolerating long dry periods. It prefers well-draining, lean soil and requires little to no fertilizer. Overwatering is the primary concern for this drought-adapted species.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy, or rocky desert soils and does not require regular fertilization.
