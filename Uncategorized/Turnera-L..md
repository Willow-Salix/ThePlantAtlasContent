## Care Guide
Turnera plants thrive in tropical to subtropical climates with ample sunlight. They require regular watering during their growing period, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and benefit from moderate feeding. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. Apply a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
