## Care Guide
Lance-leaf Arrowhead thrives in full to partial sun within a wetland environment. Ensure its roots are consistently submerged in shallow water or the soil remains saturated at all times. Provide moderate nutrients to support its vigorous growth, mimicking its natural habitat in subtropical and tropical marshes.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to rich nutrient needs. Benefit from slow-release aquatic plant fertilizer tabs applied seasonally or a nutrient-rich substrate.
