## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Rocky Mountains of the United States (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Montana) and Canada (e.g., Alberta, British Columbia). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine zones, characterized by cold winters, short growing seasons, high elevation, and rocky, well-drained soils often moistened by snowmelt. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, as it thrives in open, high-altitude environments exposed to direct solar radiation. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture during the growing season is preferred, mimicking snowmelt conditions, but critical excellent drainage is required to prevent root rot. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun with consistently moist yet exceptionally well-drained soil, mimicking its alpine habitat. It requires minimal fertilizer and is highly tolerant of cold temperatures, making good drainage paramount for successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed; native alpine soils are typically lean and nutrient-poor, so excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
