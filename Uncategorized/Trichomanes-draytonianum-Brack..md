## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawai'i (endemic to the Hawaiian Islands) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest (wet montane forests, cloud forests) |
| **Sunlight** | Extremely low light. Thrives in deep, consistent shade with no direct sun, mimicking the understory of dense forest canopies. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant, very high humidity and perpetually moist, but not waterlogged, substrate. Frequent misting and consistent watering are crucial to prevent desiccation. |

## Introduction
Trichomanes is a genus of ferns in the family Hymenophyllaceae, termed bristle ferns. The circumscription of the genus is disputed. All ferns in the genus are filmy ferns, with leaf tissue typically 2 cells thick.  This thinness generally necessitates a permanently humid habitat, and makes the fronds somewhat translucent. Because of this membrane-like frond tissue, the plant is prone to drying out. "Filmy ferns" in the taxa Hymenophyllaceae grow in constantly wet environments. Many are found in cloud forests such as "Choco" in Colombia. There are also members of the taxa that can grow submersed in water. 
The name bristle fern refers to the small bristle that protrudes from the indusia of these ferns.

## Care Guide
The Hawai'i Bristle Fern thrives in conditions mirroring its native wet montane forest habitat, demanding extremely high humidity, perpetually moist substrate, and very low, indirect light. Provide constant moisture and protect from any direct sunlight, keeping fertilization to an absolute minimum.

### Fertilizer
Very low. These ferns derive most nutrients from decaying organic matter and rain in their natural habitat. Use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/8 strength) very sparingly, perhaps once a year, or avoid altogether.
