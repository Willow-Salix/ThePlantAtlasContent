## 🌱 Overview
Machaeranthera is a genus of North American flowering plants in the family Asteraceae which are known by the common name tansyaster.
Tansyasters are variable in appearance. Some are small, singular wildflowers, while others are sprawling shrubs. Several species easily hybridize with each other, as well, making identification difficult. In general, members of the genus may be identified by the sharp-pointed, dagger-shaped anthers in the disc florets at the center of the flower. The flower heads are usually daisylike, and are usually a shade of purple or blue, but may be pink, yellow, or white. Tansyasters are native to western North America.
The genus Machaeranthera is distinguished from the genus Dieteria by having once- or twice-pinnate leaves, whereas Dieteria has entire to toothed leaves.
Machaeranthera means "swordlike anthers".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient desert plant flourishes in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its arid native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing minimal watering, and should be allowed to dry out completely between sessions. Fertilization is rarely necessary due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; native soils are typically lean. Fertilization is generally not required, or a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth is poor.
