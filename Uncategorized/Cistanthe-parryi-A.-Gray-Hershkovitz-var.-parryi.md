## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily California, Nevada, and Arizona) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert (Mojave and Sonoran Deserts) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, unshaded desert environment. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking sporadic desert rainfall and drought conditions. |

## Introduction
Cistanthe is a plant genus which includes most plants known as pussypaws. These are small, succulent flowering plants which often bear brightly colored flowers, though they vary quite a bit between species in appearance. Some species have flowers that are tightly packed into fluffy-looking inflorescences, the trait that gives them their common name. 
The genus has a disjunct distribution, with species in California and northeastern Mexico, on the Mexican Pacific Islands, and western and southern South America from Peru to northern and central Chile to northwestern and southern Argentina.
Many are adapted to arid environments, with some able to withstand climates that almost completely lack rainfall. Cistanthe was a genus created to segregate several species previously classified in Calandrinia. Several species from other closely related genera have been moved into Cistanthe as well.

## Care Guide
Parry's Pussypaws thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its arid desert origins. Water sparingly and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing to ensure optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Desert soils are typically lean, so rich soil or frequent fertilization can be detrimental. If needed, a very diluted, low-nitrogen fertilizer once a year in spring.
