## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (United States, Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forest Edge |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun (as it thrives in open, disturbed areas and forest edges) |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the topsoil to dry slightly between applications, consistent with temperate rainfall patterns and its adaptability to disturbed sites. |

## Introduction
Chenopodium is a genus of numerous species of perennial or annual herbaceous flowering plants known as the goosefoot, which occur almost anywhere in the world. It is placed in the family Amaranthaceae in the APG II system; older classification systems, notably the widely used Cronquist system, separate it and its relatives as Chenopodiaceae, but this leaves the rest of the Amaranthaceae polyphyletic. However, among the Amaranthaceae, the genus Chenopodium is the namesake member of the subfamily Chenopodioideae.

## Care Guide
Lanceleaf Goosefoot is a resilient plant native to temperate North America, thriving in full to partial sun exposure. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and tolerates average to less fertile soils, requiring minimal fertilization. Its adaptable nature makes it relatively low-maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; adapted to average to poor soils typically found in disturbed habitats, so heavy feeding is unnecessary.
