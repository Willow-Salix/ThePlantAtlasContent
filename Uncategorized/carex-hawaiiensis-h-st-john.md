| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Maui, Hawaiʻi) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane Wet Forest / Montane Bog |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers bright indirect light to partial sun. Protect from harsh afternoon sun, though it can tolerate some direct morning exposure in a bog-like setup. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil, never allowing it to dry out. High humidity is also essential, mimicking its native boggy and wet forest environments. |

## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rare Hawaiian sedge thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, mimicking its native montane bog and wet forest habitats. Provide bright indirect light to partial sun and high humidity, ensuring the soil never dries out. Fertilize sparingly with a dilute solution during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
A light feeder; apply a dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once a month) during the active growing season.
