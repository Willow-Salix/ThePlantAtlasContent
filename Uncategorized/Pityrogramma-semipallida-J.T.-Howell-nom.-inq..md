## Care Guide
This Goldback Fern thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright indirect light, mimicking its native tropical forest edge habitat. Ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained. Fertilize sparingly during its active growth period to support its modest nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer) to support its growth in moderately rich soils.
