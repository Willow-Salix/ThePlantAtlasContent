## 🌱 Overview
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Phloxleaf Bedstraw is a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant well-suited for sunny, dry environments. It thrives with minimal water and fertilizer, mimicking its native Mediterranean chaparral habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; thrives in lean, rocky soils, so very minimal or no supplemental feeding is typically required.
