## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern North America (primarily California, Arizona, Baja California) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Woodland/Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade, avoiding direct intense sunlight. |

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in bright indirect light and high humidity, typical of its native Mediterranean woodland habitat. It requires frequent atmospheric moisture through misting or high ambient humidity, rather than traditional watering, and does not need fertilization.

### Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer required; lichens obtain trace nutrients from the air and the substrate they grow on.
