## Introduction
Bignonia capreolata is a vine commonly referred to as crossvine.  The common name refers to the cross-shaped pattern revealed when the stem is cut; this pattern results from four radial wedges of phloem embedded within the stem's xylem.  It is native to the central and southern United States.  The vine climbs without twining but does produce tendrils.  It produces long tubular flowers which are red and yellow and frequently have a mocha fragrance.  The leaves are dark green to almost purple and produced as opposite pairs with terminal tendrils.  The vine often climbs very high, with leaves only remaining on the uppermost portion of the plant. Crossvine can spread aggressively through stolons and may need to be managed in garden or domestic settings.
There was for some time confusion surrounding the name of this plant, which was apparently sometimes referred to as "Bignonia crucigera", a name more properly referring to a different plant altogether.

## Care Guide
Thriving in its native humid subtropical environment, Crossvine prefers full sun to partial shade for optimal blooming. Provide consistently moist, well-drained soil and a light spring fertilization to support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in early spring, especially if soil is poor.
