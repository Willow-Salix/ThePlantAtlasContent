## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida and Georgia) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives with ample direct sunlight, especially during morning hours, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, particularly during its active growing season in warmer months. Water regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Reduce frequency during cooler, dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Commelina is a genus of approximately 208 species commonly called dayflowers due to the short lives of their flowers. They are less often known as widow's tears. It is by far the largest genus of its family, Commelinaceae. The Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus of the 18th century named the genus after the two Dutch botanists Jan Commelijn and his nephew Caspar, each representing one of the showy petals of Commelina communis.
The dayflowers are herbs that may be either perennial or annual. They are characterised by their zygomorphic flowers and by the involucral bracts called spathes that surround the flower stalks. These spathes are often filled with a mucilaginous liquid. Each spathe houses either one or two scorpioid cymes, with the upper cyme being either vestigial or bearing from one to several typically male flowers, and the lower cyme bearing several flowers. All members of the genus have alternate leaves.
The Asiatic dayflower (Commelina communis) is probably the best known species in the West. It is a common weed in parts of Europe and throughout eastern North America. Several species, such as Commelina benghalensis, are eaten as a leaf vegetable in Southeast Asia and Africa.

## Care Guide
Nash's Dayflower is a subtropical plant that prefers bright, direct sunlight and consistently moist conditions, mirroring its native pine flatwoods habitat. It thrives with regular watering throughout warm growing periods and benefits from light, infrequent fertilization. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer can be applied monthly during the growing season, or a slow-release granular fertilizer once per season. Avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to less nutrient-rich sandy soils.
