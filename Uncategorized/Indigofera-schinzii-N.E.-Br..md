## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Africa (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola) |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Subtropical Grassland and Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun to partial sun exposure for optimal growth, tolerating direct intense sunlight typical of open savannas. |
| **Watering** | Water moderately during active growth, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry out between waterings. Significantly reduce or cease watering during cooler or dry dormant periods, as it is well-adapted to drought. |

## Care Guide
This Southern African native thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, showing good drought tolerance. Water regularly during its active growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and reduce drastically during dormancy. Minimal fertilization is required due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### Fertilizer
As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has low to moderate fertilizer needs. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or compost applied once in spring should be sufficient, or none if planted in rich soil.
