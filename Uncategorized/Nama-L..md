## Care Guide
Nama species are hardy desert plants that thrive in dry, sunny environments. Provide full sun exposure and practice infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to fully dry between sessions. They are low-nutrient plants and generally do not require significant fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low. Minimal to no fertilization is required. If desired, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
