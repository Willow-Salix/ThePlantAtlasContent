## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Mojave Suncup thrives in conditions mirroring its desert home, needing full sun and very well-draining soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between sessions, and avoid rich fertilization. This plant is drought-tolerant and sensitive to excessive moisture.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required; thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or gravelly soils common in its native arid environment.
