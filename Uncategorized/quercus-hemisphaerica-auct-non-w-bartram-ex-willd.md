| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (coastal plains from Virginia to Florida and west to Texas). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest (characterized by warm temperatures, high humidity, and significant rainfall year-round, often found in lowlands and floodplains). |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth, capable of tolerating some partial shade, especially when young. It thrives as a canopy tree in well-exposed locations. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, reflecting its native habitat in floodplains and along water bodies. It is not drought-tolerant and benefits from regular watering, especially during dry periods, but also tolerates occasional temporary flooding. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tree, often associated with the Laurel Oak, originates from the humid subtropical forests of the Southeastern U.S. It requires full sun exposure and consistently moist to wet soil conditions, thriving with abundant water. Established trees are generally low-maintenance regarding fertilization when planted in suitable, nutrient-rich soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in naturally rich, often alluvial soils with good organic matter content. A balanced slow-release fertilizer can support young trees or those in nutrient-poor soils, but established trees typically require minimal supplemental feeding.
