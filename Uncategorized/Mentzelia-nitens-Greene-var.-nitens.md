## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full, direct sun and requires very infrequent watering, making it highly drought-tolerant. It prefers lean, well-draining soil and typically does not need fertilizer, ideal for arid garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Native to lean, often rocky desert soils, it does not require rich nutrients and can be harmed by excessive fertilization.
