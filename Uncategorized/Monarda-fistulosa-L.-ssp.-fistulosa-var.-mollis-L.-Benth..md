## Introduction
Monarda fistulosa, the wild bergamot or bee balm, is a wildflower in the mint family Lamiaceae, widespread and abundant as a native plant in much of North America. This plant, with showy summer-blooming pink to lavender flowers, is often used as a honey plant, medicinal plant, and garden ornamental.  The species is quite variable, and several subspecies or varieties have been recognized within it. Despite its name, it has no relation to the 'true' bergamot, a citrus fruit.

## Care Guide
Wild Bergamot thrives in full sun to partial shade, reflecting its native open woodland and prairie habitats in temperate North America. It prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil but exhibits good drought tolerance once established. Fertilization is typically low, as rich native soils provide adequate nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Low. Generally not required in average to fertile soils. A light application of compost in spring is sufficient if soil is poor.
