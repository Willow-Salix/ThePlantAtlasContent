## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate regions across Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (epiphytic/saxicolous) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to indirect light. As a lichen, it requires protection from prolonged direct sunlight which can cause desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires high ambient humidity and regular exposure to moisture from rain or mist; traditional watering is not applicable as it does not absorb water through roots. |

## Introduction
Lecania is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. Lecania is widely distributed, especially in temperate regions, and contains about 65 species. These lichens form thin, crusty growths on various surfaces and produce small disc-shaped fruiting bodies that are typically brown to black in colour. Most species reproduce both sexually through spores and asexually through tiny reproductive structures, allowing them to spread effectively in their environments.

## Care Guide
Caring for this lichen involves maintaining consistently high atmospheric humidity and providing protection from harsh, direct sunlight. It thrives in temperate, moist environments on suitable substrates like tree bark or rock surfaces. Traditional watering and fertilization are not required and can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
None; lichens obtain necessary nutrients directly from the air and their substrate, and are sensitive to chemical fertilizers.
