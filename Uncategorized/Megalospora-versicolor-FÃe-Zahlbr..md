## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pantropical regions, including Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and parts of Africa. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Humid Forests (Rainforests) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to dappled light. As an epiphytic lichen, it typically grows on tree bark beneath a canopy, avoiding direct, harsh sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and frequent moisture from rainfall or dew. It absorbs water directly from the air and rain, rather than through roots like a vascular plant. |

## Care Guide
Megalospora versicolor, a tropical crustose lichen, thrives in high humidity and partial shade, typical of rainforest environments. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere, thus requiring consistent ambient moisture rather than traditional watering or fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilization. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air, rainwater, and the substrate they colonize.
