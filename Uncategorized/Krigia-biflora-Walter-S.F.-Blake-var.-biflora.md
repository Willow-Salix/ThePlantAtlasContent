## Introduction
Krigia is a genus of North American flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Plants of the genus are known generally as dwarf dandelions or dwarfdandelions.
The species vary in morphology. They are annual or perennial herbs growing from a fibrous root system or a taproot. One species has rhizomes with tubers. The plants produce a single stem or up to 50 or more, usually growing erect, reaching a few centimeters to 75 centimeters tall. Most of the leaves are basal, but some stems have leaves higher up. The blades are often linear to lance-shaped, toothed or lobed, and borne on winged petioles. The flower heads are solitary, growing at the top of the stem or on stalks from the leaf axils. They contain up to 60 yellow or orange flowers. The fruit is a hairless, ribbed cypsela, sometimes with a pappus.

## Care Guide
This adaptable plant from temperate North America thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate, consistent moisture in well-drained soil. It has low fertilizer needs, making it a relatively low-maintenance option suitable for various garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in average to moderately fertile soil. Supplemental fertilization is generally not required unless soil is very poor; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial in such cases.
