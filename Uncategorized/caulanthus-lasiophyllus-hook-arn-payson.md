## 🌱 Overview
Caulanthus is a genus of plants in the family Brassicaceae. Plants of this genus may be known as jewelflowers. They are also often referred to as wild cabbage, although this common name usually refers to wild variants of Brassica oleracea, the cabbage plant. Jewelflowers are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they are often found in warm, arid regions. Many species have an enlarged, erect stem rising from a basal rosette of leaves. Flowers arise directly from the surface of the stem; many species have colorful, bell-shaped flowers. The best-known of the fourteen species is probably the desert candle.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
California Mustard thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid environments. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. These plants are adapted to nutrient-poor soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
