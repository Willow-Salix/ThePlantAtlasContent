# Rhachithecium Moss
### *Rhachithecium perpusillum (Thwaites & Mitt.) Broth.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Pantropical, including regions of Asia (e.g., Sri Lanka, India, Philippines, China), Africa, and Central/South America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Humid Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate indirect light. As an understory or epiphytic moss, it's adapted to filtered light and will suffer from direct, intense sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high humidity and regular moisture. Mimic frequent tropical rainfall by keeping the substrate or environment moist but not waterlogged, and ensure high ambient humidity. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rhachithecium moss thrives in environments that replicate its native tropical and subtropical humid forest habitat. Provide low to moderate indirect light, consistently high humidity, and regular moisture without allowing waterlogging. Fertilization needs are minimal to none.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs, typically acquiring them from rainwater and decaying organic matter. A highly diluted, infrequent liquid fertilizer or no fertilization is generally best.
