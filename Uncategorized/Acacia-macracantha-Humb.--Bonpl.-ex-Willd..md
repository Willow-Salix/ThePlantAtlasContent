## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico, Central America (e.g., Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica), and northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest and Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water moderately when the soil is dry to the touch, especially during warmer growing seasons, and reduce watering significantly during cooler or dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Acacia, commonly known as wattles or acacias, is a genus of about 1,084 species of shrubs and trees in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the pea family Fabaceae. Initially, it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa, South America, and Australasia, but is now reserved for species mainly from Australia, with others from New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. The genus name is Neo-Latin, borrowed from Koine Greek ἀκακία (akakia), a term used in antiquity to describe a preparation extracted from Vachellia nilotica, the original type species.
Several species of Acacia have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant acacia thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its native tropical dry forests and arid scrublands. It requires moderate watering during active growth, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and minimal watering during cooler periods. Fertilization needs are low to moderate due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied annually in spring, or a liquid feed monthly during the growing season. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so heavy nitrogen fertilization is often unnecessary.
