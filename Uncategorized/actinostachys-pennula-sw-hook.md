## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across the Neotropics (Central and South America, Caribbean), Tropical Africa, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forests, Wetlands, and Seasonally Wet Grasslands. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. In its native habitat, it grows in open or semi-shaded damp areas, so direct, harsh sunlight should be avoided. |
| **💧 Water** | Maintain consistently moist, acidic soil, but avoid waterlogging, mimicking its boggy or swampy native conditions. High ambient humidity is crucial for its survival and growth. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fern requires a high humidity environment and consistently moist, acidic soil, reflecting its native tropical and subtropical wetland habitats. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and fertilize lightly during its active growth phase to ensure optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the active growing season (spring/summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler, dormant periods.
