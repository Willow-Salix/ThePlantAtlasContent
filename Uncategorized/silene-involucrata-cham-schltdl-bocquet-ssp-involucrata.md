## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Greenland) and Eurasia (e.g., Siberia, Russian Far East) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Sun. This plant is adapted to open, exposed environments with long daylight hours during the short growing season, though the sun's intensity is often lower. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist during the active growing season (spring and summer), mimicking the conditions of snowmelt and shallow permafrost thaw. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging; significantly reduce watering during dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Silene is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. Containing nearly 900 species, it is the largest genus in the family. Common names include campion and catchfly. Many Silene species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Arctic Catchfly thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil during its brief active growing period. It prefers lean, nutrient-poor conditions, so avoid over-fertilizing. Ensure adequate drainage to prevent root rot in its naturally damp yet not stagnant environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Arctic tundra soils are typically poor in nutrients. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once at the start of the growing season.
