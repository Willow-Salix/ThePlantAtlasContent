## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet and Dry |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and fruit production. Young trees can tolerate partial shade. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist (but not waterlogged) soil, particularly when young and during flowering/fruiting periods. Established trees are somewhat drought-tolerant but perform best with consistent moisture. |

## Introduction
Manilkara zapota, commonly known as sapodilla (Spanish: [ˌsapoˈðiʝa]), sapote, chicozapote, chico, chicoo, chicle, naseberry, nispero, or
soapapple, among other names, is an evergreen tree native to southern Mexico and Central America. An example natural occurrence is in coastal Yucatán, in the Petenes mangroves ecoregion, where it is a subdominant plant species. It was introduced to the Philippines during Spanish colonization. It is grown in large quantities in Mexico and in tropical Asia, including India, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, as well as in the Caribbean.

## Care Guide
The Sapodilla tree thrives in full sun and warm, humid tropical conditions with well-drained soil. It requires consistent watering, especially when young and during fruiting, and benefits from regular fertilization. Protecting young trees from frost is important as they are not cold-hardy.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced fertilizer application 2-3 times per year, especially during active growth and fruiting. Incorporating organic matter into the soil is also beneficial.
