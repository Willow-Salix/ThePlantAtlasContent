## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (California, Oregon, Nevada) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean-influenced Montane to Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, thriving in open, exposed locations. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during spring and early summer (active growth); reduce significantly or withhold water during dry summer dormancy to prevent rot. Requires excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
Looseflower Indian Paintbrush thrives in full sun with lean, very well-drained soil, mimicking its native montane habitats. It requires moderate watering during its spring growth but needs a dry period during summer dormancy, adapting to its drought-prone origins. Avoid heavy fertilization to ensure its health.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean, well-drained, even rocky soils. Rich soil or heavy fertilization can be detrimental, especially since it is hemiparasitic.
