## 🧤 Care Instructions
Osterhout's lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, consistent with its native temperate montane habitats. It requires moderate, consistent watering during its growing season but is drought-tolerant once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it needs minimal to no additional fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; as a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen and enriches the soil, thriving in lean to moderately fertile soils. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
