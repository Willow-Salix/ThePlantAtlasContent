## Care Guide
To thrive, the Canary Island Date Palm requires full sun exposure and moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. Fertilize regularly during warmer months with a palm-specific formula to support robust growth. This palm is well-suited to Mediterranean-like conditions and can tolerate some drought once established.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high fertilization during the growing season (spring to fall) with a palm-specific fertilizer rich in potassium and magnesium.
