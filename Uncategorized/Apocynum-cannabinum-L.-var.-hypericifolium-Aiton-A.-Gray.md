## Introduction
Apocynum, commonly known as dogbane or Indian hemp, is a small genus of the flowering plant family Apocynaceae. Its name comes from Ancient Greek ἀπόκυνον, from ἀπο- apo- "away" and κύων kyōn "dog", referring to dogbane (Cionura erecta), which was used to poison dogs. The genus is native to North America, temperate Asia, and southeastern Europe.
Apocynum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the queen butterfly and the mouse moth.

## Care Guide
This adaptable North American native thrives in full to partial sun across various temperate habitats, including prairies and open woodlands. It prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil but exhibits strong drought tolerance once established. Minimal fertilization is typically needed due to its hardiness, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally does not require heavy fertilization, as it is adapted to average to poor soils. A light application of a balanced fertilizer can be given annually if growth is poor.
