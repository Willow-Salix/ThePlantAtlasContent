## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Basin (Southern Europe, North Africa) and arid to semi-arid regions of Western North America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean/Semi-Arid Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to high light conditions, as it typically grows on exposed rocks. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low water; tolerates prolonged drought, relying on infrequent rainfall and atmospheric moisture such as dew. |

## 🌱 Overview
Acarospora is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Acarosporaceae. Most species in the genus are crustose lichens that grow on rocks in open and arid places all over the world. They may look like a cobblestone road or cracked up old paint, and are commonly called cobblestone lichens or cracked lichens. They usually grow on rock (are "saxicolous"), but some grow on soil (terricolous) or on other lichens. Some species in the genus are fungi that live as parasites on other lichens (lichenicolous fungi). Acarospora is a widely distributed genus, with about 128 species according to a 2008 estimate.
Species in Acarospora may be shiny as if covered with a glossy varnish, or dull and powdery looking. They have a diverse range of colors, from the brilliant yellow bright cobblestone lichen, to the dark reddish-brown mountain cobblestone lichen, or they can appear tan, gray, or white, from a dusty-looking coating (pruina). They may grow in crustose forms like a warty surface (verrucose), like cracking-up old crust of paint (rimose), like a bunch of "islands" in a dry lake bed (areolate), like the flakes of cracking up paint are peeling up at the edges (sub-squamulous), or like the flakes are growing over others like scales (squamulous).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy saxicolous lichen thrives in full sun and very dry conditions, typical of its native Mediterranean and semi-arid habitats. It requires no fertilization and minimal watering, absorbing moisture primarily from the atmosphere and occasional rainfall.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; lichens derive nutrients from the air and their substrate (rocks).
