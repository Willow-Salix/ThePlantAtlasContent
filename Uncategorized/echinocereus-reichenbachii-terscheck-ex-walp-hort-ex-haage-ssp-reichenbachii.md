## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Great Plains of the USA (Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico) and northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Semi-arid Grasslands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; requires strong, direct light for optimal growth and flowering, similar to its exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking desert rainfall patterns. Reduce or cease watering during dormant winter months to prevent rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, demanding infrequent, deep watering only when completely dry. Provide minimal, diluted fertilizer during its spring/summer growth period. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nutrient needs; apply a balanced, diluted cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer), reflecting the generally poor soils of its native habitat.
