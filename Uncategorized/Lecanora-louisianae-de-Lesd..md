## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to partial shade, avoiding direct, intense sunlight that can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity is critical. Requires regular moisture from the air or rainfall; frequent misting is beneficial, and the substrate should remain consistently moist but not waterlogged. |

## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in high humidity and indirect light, mirroring its native humid subtropical forest environment. Consistent atmospheric moisture is crucial, best achieved through regular misting and providing a stable, moist substrate like tree bark. Avoid direct sunlight and refrain from using traditional fertilizers, as these can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is typically needed or recommended, as lichens absorb necessary nutrients from the air and precipitation; commercial fertilizers can be harmful.
