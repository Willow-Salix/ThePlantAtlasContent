## Introduction
Hierochloe is a genus of plants in the grass family known generally as sweetgrass. These are perennial rhizomatous grasses found primarily in temperate and subarctic regions of Eurasia and North America, although some species extend southwards into Australia and Latin America.
These erect green grasses are known for their sweet scent. They bear panicle inflorescences with rounded grass grain fruits.
Some authors advocate merging the two genera Hierochloe and Anthoxanthum, though others disagree.

## Care Guide
Nash's Vanilla Grass, native to the humid subtropical savannas and pinelands of the southeastern U.S., thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently moist soil, reflecting its high-rainfall native habitat. Fertilize lightly during the growing season to support its growth in moderately fertile soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer). A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer would be suitable, as native soils are often not exceptionally rich.
