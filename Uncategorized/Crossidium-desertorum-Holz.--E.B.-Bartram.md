# Desert Crossidium Moss

*Crossidium desertorum Holz. & E.B. Bartram* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States, Mexico, North Africa, Middle East |
| **Climate** | Arid Deserts and Semi-Arid Scrublands |
| **Sunlight** | High light to full sun exposure, adapted to intense direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent watering. Allow substrate to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking desert rainfall patterns. Tolerates prolonged drought periods and rehydrates after rain. |

## Care Guide
This desert moss requires bright, intense light and very infrequent watering, allowing for complete drying between hydration cycles. Mimic its arid native habitat by providing a well-draining substrate and avoiding consistent moisture, which it handles through desiccation tolerance rather than constant dampness.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in nutrient-poor environments, typical of desert soils.
