## Introduction
Physostegia, the lionshearts or false dragonheads  (in reference to their similarity to Dracocephalum), is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae, native to North America (United States, Canada, northern Mexico). They are erect rhizomatous herbaceous perennials inhabiting damp, sunny places. 
They grow up to 2 m (7 ft) tall with purple or pink tubular flowers in racemes in summer.
The generic name comes from two Greek words, physa (a bladder) and stege (a covering), referring to the calyx, which becomes full of fruit when mature.
Physostegia virginiana is the most common species, and is known as "obedient plant".

## Care Guide
Ledingham's False Dragonhead prefers full to partial sun and consistently moist soil, mirroring its native wetland and prairie edge habitats. Ensure regular watering to prevent the soil from drying out, and provide moderate soil fertility for robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. It thrives in fertile, well-draining soil. A light application of balanced fertilizer or compost in spring is usually sufficient for optimal growth.
