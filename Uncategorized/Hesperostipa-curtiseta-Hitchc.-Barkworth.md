## Introduction
Hesperostipa is a genus of grasses in the family Poaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as needle-and-thread grass or needlegrass.
The Hesperostipa species, formerly called Stipa, are endemic to North America. The new name adds Classical Greek: ἕσπερος, romanized: hesperos, lit. 'western', as other Stipa species are found on the Eurasian continent (i.e., the eastern hemisphere).

## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, mimicking its native prairie habitat. It requires moderate watering to establish but becomes highly drought-tolerant, needing little to no fertilizer in suitable soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically not needed in native or well-adapted garden soils. Can benefit from a very light, balanced fertilizer application in very poor soils.
