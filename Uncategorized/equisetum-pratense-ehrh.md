## 🌱 Overview
Equisetum pratense, commonly known as meadow horsetail, shade horsetail or shady horsetail, is a widespread horsetail (Equisetophyta) and it is a pteridophyte. Shade horsetail can be commonly found in forests with tall trees or very thick foliage that can provide shade and tends to grow closer and thicker around streams, ponds and rivers. The specific epithet pratense is Latin, meaning pasture or meadow dwelling.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Meadow Horsetail thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, replicating its native habitat in damp woodlands and meadows. It prefers partial shade but can tolerate full sun if given ample water. Minimal fertilization is required as it adapts well to various soil types.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is not a heavy feeder and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. An occasional dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied if growth seems stunted.
