## Care Guide
Grimmia incurva thrives in cold, exposed, and nutrient-poor conditions, mimicking its native alpine and montane habitats. Provide ample bright light and allow it to dry out between waterings, as it tolerates desiccation well. Avoid regular fertilization to prevent harm.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required; it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.
