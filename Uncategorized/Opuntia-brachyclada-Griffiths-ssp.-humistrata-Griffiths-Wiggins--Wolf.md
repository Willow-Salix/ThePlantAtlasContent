## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Colorado, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open desert habitat with no significant canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, typical of drought-prone desert environments with limited rainfall. |

## Introduction
Opuntia, commonly called the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family Cactaceae, many known for their flavorful fruit and showy flowers. Cacti are native to the Americas, and are well adapted to arid climates; however, they are still vulnerable to alterations in precipitation and temperature driven by climate change. The plant has been introduced to Australia, southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.
Prickly pear alone is also used to refer to the fruit, but may also be used for the plant itself; in addition, other names given to the plant and its specific parts include tuna (fruit), sabra, sabbar, nopal (pads, plural nopales, from the Nahuatl word nōpalli), nostle (fruit) from the Nahuatl word nōchtli, and paddle cactus. The genus is named for the Ancient Greek city of Opus. The fruit and leaves are edible. The most common culinary species is the "Barbary fig" (Opuntia ficus-indica).
In places where they have been introduced outside their native range, some species in the genus Opuntia behave as aggressive invasive species.

## Care Guide
This pricklypear thrives in conditions mimicking its arid desert origin, requiring abundant direct sunlight and minimal water. Use a well-draining soil mix to prevent root rot and fertilize sparingly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; a balanced, diluted cactus fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, reflecting the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.
