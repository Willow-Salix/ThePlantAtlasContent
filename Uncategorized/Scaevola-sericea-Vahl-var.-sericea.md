## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific, including Southeast Asia, Australia, and numerous Pacific islands (e.g., Hawaii, Micronesia, Polynesia) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Coastal Strand/Littoral Zone |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it naturally grows in exposed coastal environments without canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Tolerant of drought once established, but prefers regular watering, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings. It is accustomed to periods of high moisture from rain and salt spray, but also well-drained sandy soils. |

## Introduction
Scaevola taccada, also known as beach cabbage, sea lettuce, or beach naupaka, is a flowering plant in the family Goodeniaceae found in mangrove swamps and rocky or sandy coastal locations in the tropical areas of the Indo-Pacific. It is a common beach shrub throughout the Arabian Sea, the tropical Indian Ocean and the tropical islands of the Pacific Ocean.
There has long been confusion over the correct scientific name for this species. It is also known by the synonym Scaevola sericea.

## Care Guide
This resilient coastal plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils. While drought-tolerant once established, it benefits from regular watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. It requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for warm, sunny environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Thrives in nutrient-poor sandy soils typical of its native habitat; over-fertilization can be detrimental. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice a year during the growing season is sufficient.
