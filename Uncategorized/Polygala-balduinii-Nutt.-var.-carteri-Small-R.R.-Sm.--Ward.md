## Introduction
Polygala is a large genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygalaceae. They are commonly known as milkworts or snakeroots. The genus is distributed widely throughout much of the world in temperate zones and the tropics. The genus name Polygala comes from the ancient Greek "much milk", as the plant was thought to increase milk yields in cattle.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full to partial sun with consistently moist, acidic soil, mimicking its native wet pine savanna habitat. It requires regular watering to prevent drying out and benefits from light fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy, acidic soils; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or light liquid feed during the growing season would suffice.
