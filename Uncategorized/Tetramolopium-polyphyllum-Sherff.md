## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Island of Hawaii (Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa), USA |
| **Climate** | Subalpine Dryland Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure, mimicking its native high-elevation, exposed habitats on lava fields and cinder cones. |
| **Watering** | Prefers infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, adapting to the dry conditions and porous substrates of its native environment. |

## Introduction
Tetramolopium is a genus of plants in the tribe Astereae within the family Asteraceae.
Most of the species are native to New Guinea, 11 species are found in Hawaii, and one in the Cook Islands, with the island populations apparently representing a recent (by evolutionary standards) colonization.  It is related to Camptacra, Kippistia, Minuria, Peripleura, and Vittadinia all of which are from Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, or Pacific islands.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native demands full sun and excellent drainage, thriving in conditions similar to its high-elevation, exposed, and dry natural habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely, and avoid over-fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor volcanic soils.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in nutrient-poor soils; apply minimal or no fertilizer, as excessive nutrients can be detrimental to a plant adapted to barren volcanic substrates.
