## Care Guide
Red Amaranth thrives in full sun and requires consistent moisture in well-drained, fertile soil. It's a robust plant, often grown as an annual, that benefits from regular feeding to support vigorous growth and seed production. Mimicking its tropical origins, provide warmth and adequate water, especially during its growing season.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high, particularly if grown for grain or foliage; it benefits from fertile soil rich in organic matter, akin to nutrient-replenished agricultural lands where it was domesticated.
