## 🌱 Overview
Glyceria is a widespread genus of grass family common across Eurasia, Australia, North Africa, and the Americas.
Glyceria is known commonly as mannagrass in the United States, or, in the UK, sweet-grass. These are perennial rhizomatous grasses found in wet areas in temperate regions worldwide. The base of the grass grows along the ground and may root at several places. Then it grows erect and bears leaf blades which may be flat or folded. The panicle inflorescences nod when heavy.  Some mannagrasses are considered weeds while others are endangered in their native habitats.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Saltmarsh Grass thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet to waterlogged conditions, tolerating brackish water. Mimic its native coastal marsh habitat by ensuring ample moisture and good light. It adapts well to nutrient-rich wetland soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; naturally grows in nutrient-rich, silty-muddy soils of wetlands. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced aquatic plant fertilizer if grown in poor substrate.
