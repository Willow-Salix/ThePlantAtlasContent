## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical America, including South America (e.g., Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay), Central America, and the Caribbean. |
| **Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Moist Forest/Woodland, often found terrestrially in rocky outcrops, forest edges, or disturbed areas. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. In its natural habitat, it often grows in semi-open or edge environments, so it appreciates filtered light rather than deep shade or intense direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep the soil consistently moist but never waterlogged. Its native moist forest climate suggests regular, even watering. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly before rewatering. High humidity is crucial. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
The Leatherleaf Goldback Fern thrives in conditions similar to its native tropical and subtropical moist forest edges. Provide bright indirect light, consistent soil moisture with excellent drainage, and high humidity. Fertilize lightly during its active growth period to support its robust nature.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted (e.g., half strength) balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Its presence in potentially disturbed or rocky areas suggests it doesn't require overly rich soil.
