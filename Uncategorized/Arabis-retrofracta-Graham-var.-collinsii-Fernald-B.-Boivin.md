## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native Western North American semi-arid and steppe environments. Provide infrequent watering once established, allowing soil to dry out between waterings, and fertilize very sparingly if at all.

### Fertilizer
Low nutrient requirements. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, especially in lean soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
