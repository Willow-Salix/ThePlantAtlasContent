## Introduction
Polygala is a large genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygalaceae. They are commonly known as milkworts or snakeroots. The genus is distributed widely throughout much of the world in temperate zones and the tropics. The genus name Polygala comes from the ancient Greek "much milk", as the plant was thought to increase milk yields in cattle.

## Care Guide
The New Mexico Milkwort thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid to semi-arid grasslands, requiring full sun and minimal watering. Ensure well-draining soil and avoid over-fertilization to maintain its health and vigor, especially in a landscape setting.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the growing season, or not at all if planted in good garden soil.
