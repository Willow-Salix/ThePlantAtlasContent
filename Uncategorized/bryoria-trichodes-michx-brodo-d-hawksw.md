## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in cool, moist boreal and temperate coniferous forests across the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Boreal Forest and Temperate Coniferous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. It typically grows on trees within a forest canopy, so it avoids intense, direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Frequent misting or placement in a high-humidity environment is crucial, as lichens absorb moisture directly from the air. Allow to dry slightly between hydration cycles. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bryoria is a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. Many members of this genus are known as horsehair lichens. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in boreal and cool temperate areas. These lichens typically grow as slender, hair-like strands that hang from conifer trees or form small bushes, ranging in colour from dark brown to pale grey. They play important ecological roles, particularly as winter food for caribou in northern forests, where some species can accumulate in large quantities in the forest canopy. The genus contains about 35 species found worldwide, with ongoing discoveries of new species especially in mountainous regions of Asia and western North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Horsehair Lichen thrives in cool, humid conditions with bright, indirect light, mimicking its native boreal and temperate forest habitats. Maintain high ambient humidity and mist frequently, avoiding any traditional fertilization as it obtains nutrients from the air.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Most chemical fertilizers can be detrimental, as it obtains necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition.
