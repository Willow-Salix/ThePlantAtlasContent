## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean coastal scrub habitat. Water moderately during its growing season, reducing frequency during dry summer dormancy. It requires minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization, if any, as native soils in its habitat are often lean. Over-fertilization can harm the plant.
