## Care Guide
Bird's-foot Trefoil is a robust plant that thrives in full sun to partial shade within temperate climates. It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, becoming quite drought-tolerant once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it requires minimal to no supplemental fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, especially nitrogen-rich types, as it is a legume and fixes its own nitrogen. Thrives in moderately fertile to poor soils.
