*Clauzadeana macula (Taylor) Coppins & Rambold* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mountainous regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including the Alps, Pyrenees, Scandinavia, and the Rocky Mountains. |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Montane Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to high light exposure, typical of exposed rock surfaces in alpine environments. |
| **Watering** | Absorbs moisture directly from rain, dew, and high atmospheric humidity. Requires regular exposure to natural precipitation cycles and tolerates periods of desiccation. |

## Introduction
Clauzadeana is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the  family Lecanoraceae. The genus was circumscribed in 1984 by Claude Roux,  with the crustose species C. instratula assigned as the type.
The genus name Clauzadeana honours F.J. Georges Clauzade (1914–2002), a French teacher and botanist (Mycology and Lichenology).

## Care Guide
Clauzadeana macula is an alpine crustose lichen that thrives on exposed rocks in high-altitude environments. It requires significant light exposure and depends entirely on natural precipitation and high atmospheric humidity for its moisture needs, enduring periodic dry spells. No fertilization is needed, as typical plant fertilizers are harmful to lichens.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. This lichen obtains all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere and the mineral substrate; conventional fertilizers are detrimental and should be avoided.
