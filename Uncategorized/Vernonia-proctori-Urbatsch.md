| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in high light exposure characteristic of open thickets. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is needed during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is tolerant of dry periods, reflecting its adaptation to a distinct dry season. |

## Introduction
Vernonia is a genus of about 350 species of forbs and shrubs in the family Asteraceae. Some species of this genus are known as ironweeds. Some species are edible and of economic value. They are known for having intense purple flowers. There have been numerous distinct subgenera and subsections named in this genus, and some botanists have divided the genus into several distinct genera. For instance, the Flora of North America recognizes only about twenty species in Vernonia sensu stricto, seventeen of which are in North America north of Mexico, with the others being found in South America.

## Care Guide
Proctor's Ironweed requires conditions similar to its native Jamaican tropical dry forest environment. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications. Fertilize sparingly during active growth to support its robust development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during its active growth phase. Heavy fertilization is not typically required, consistent with its growth in naturally less fertile limestone soils.
