## 🌱 Overview
Rosa blanda, commonly known as the smooth rose, meadow/wild rose, or prairie rose, is a species of rose native to North America. Among roses, it is closest to a "thornless" rose, with just a few thorns at the base. The meadow rose occurs as a colony-forming shrub growing to 1 m (3.3 ft) high, naturally in prairies and meadows. The roses are quite variable, the characteristics such as leaf tip number of prickles and glandular hairs usually do not always remain constant, thus it is often confused with Rosa arkansana or Rosa carolina, the two other prairie rose species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Smooth Rose is a resilient, low-maintenance shrub that prefers full sun for optimal flowering and growth. It requires moderate watering, becoming quite drought-tolerant once established, and generally thrives in average soils with minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in average to poor soils without much amendment; a light, balanced fertilizer in early spring is optional but generally not necessary.
