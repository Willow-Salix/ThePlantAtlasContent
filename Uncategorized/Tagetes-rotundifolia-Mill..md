## Introduction
Tagetes erecta, the Aztec marigold, Mexican marigold, big marigold, cempaxochitl or cempasúchil, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Tagetes native to Mexico and Guatemala. Despite being native to the Americas, it is often called the African marigold. In Mexico, this plant is found in the wild in the states of México, Michoacán, Puebla, Veracruz and Guerrero.
This plant reaches heights of between 20 and 90 cm (7.9 and 35.4 in). The Aztecs gathered the wild plant as well as cultivating it for medicinal, ceremonial and decorative purposes; it was introduced to Europe after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and colonization and became widely cultivated commercially with many cultivars in use as ornamental plants, and for the cut-flower trade.
Some authorities regard Tagetes patula (the French marigold) as a synonym of Tagetes erecta.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its native tropical dry forest margins. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and provide low to moderate fertilization to encourage robust blooming.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Benefits from fertile soil but does not require heavy fertilization; excessive nitrogen can reduce flowering. Use a balanced fertilizer sparingly if needed.
