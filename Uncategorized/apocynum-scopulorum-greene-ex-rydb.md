## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, California, Oregon, Washington) and Canada (e.g., British Columbia, Alberta). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane Woodland and Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. It naturally grows in open meadows, along stream banks, and in open woods, indicating a preference for ample direct sunlight but tolerance for some afternoon shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist soil, especially during active growth, but is somewhat drought-tolerant once established due to its native habitat experiencing seasonal dry periods. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Apocynum, commonly known as dogbane or Indian hemp, is a small genus of the flowering plant family Apocynaceae. Its name comes from Ancient Greek ἀπόκυνον, from ἀπο- apo- "away" and κύων kyōn "dog", referring to dogbane (Cionura erecta), which was used to poison dogs. The genus is native to North America, temperate Asia, and southeastern Europe.
Apocynum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the queen butterfly and the mouse moth.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny to partly shaded locations with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native montane and grassland habitats. Water moderately, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly as it adapts well to average soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer. Thrives in average to poor, well-drained soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring should suffice only if the soil is notably deficient; otherwise, it is often not necessary.
