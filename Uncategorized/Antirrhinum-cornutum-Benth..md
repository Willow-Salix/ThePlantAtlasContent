## Introduction
Antirrhinum is a genus of plants in the Plantaginaceae family, commonly known as dragon flowers or snapdragons because of the flowers' fancied resemblance to the face of a dragon that opens and closes its mouth when laterally squeezed. They are also sometimes called toadflax or dog flower. They are native to rocky areas of Europe, the United States, Canada, and North Africa. Antirrhinum species are widely used as ornamental plants in borders and as cut flowers.

## Care Guide
This California native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its Mediterranean climate origin. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, along with light fertilization during its growing season.

### Fertilizer
Low, a light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once in spring during active growth is sufficient.
