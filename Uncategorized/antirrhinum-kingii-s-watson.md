## 🌱 Overview
Antirrhinum is a genus of plants in the Plantaginaceae family, commonly known as dragon flowers or snapdragons because of the flowers' fancied resemblance to the face of a dragon that opens and closes its mouth when laterally squeezed. They are also sometimes called toadflax or dog flower. They are native to rocky areas of Europe, the United States, Canada, and North Africa. Antirrhinum species are widely used as ornamental plants in borders and as cut flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant snapdragon thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native arid scrubland habitat. It requires minimal watering, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between applications, and has very low fertilizer needs. Mimic its desert origin for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soil. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, during the growing season.
