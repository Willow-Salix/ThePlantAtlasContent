## 🧤 Care Instructions
Roble Beech thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native temperate forest habitat. Provide regular water, particularly during active growth, and enrich the soil annually with compost or a balanced fertilizer to support its vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers moderately rich, well-draining soil. Benefit from annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring.
