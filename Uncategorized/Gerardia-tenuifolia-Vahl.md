## Care Guide
Slender Gerardia prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil that remains consistently moist. As a hemiparasitic annual, it needs minimal direct fertilization, often performing best in average soil conditions and relying on host plants for some nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This hemiparasitic plant thrives in average to poor soils and typically does not require supplemental fertilization.
