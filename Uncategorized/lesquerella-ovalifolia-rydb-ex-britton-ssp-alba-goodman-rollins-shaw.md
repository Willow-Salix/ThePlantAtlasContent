## 🌱 Overview
Lesquerella is the former name of a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Recent work has shown that Lesquerella is indistinct from the genus Physaria and both genera have been united under Physaria. In addition, the former Lesquerella of the southeastern United States have been moved to the genus Paysonia since 2002. The genus Lesquerella is now no longer applied to any species and is considered defunct.
The genus is named in honor of Leo Lesquereux, 1805–1889, Swiss and American botanist.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soils. It requires minimal watering, preferring dry conditions typical of its native semi-arid environment. Avoid over-fertilization and consistently moist soil to ensure its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to lean, rocky, or sandy soils. Minimal or no fertilizer is typically needed, as rich soils can be detrimental.
