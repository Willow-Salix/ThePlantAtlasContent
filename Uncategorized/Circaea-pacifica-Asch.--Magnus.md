## Introduction
The Circaea, or enchanter's nightshades, are a genus of flowering plants in the evening primrose family Onagraceae. About two dozen taxa have been described, including eight species. Plants of the genus occur throughout the temperate and boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere. Three taxa occur in North America: Circaea alpina, Circaea canadensis, and the hybrid Circaea × sterilis. The generic name Circaea refers to the enchantress Circe from Greek mythology who is said to have used the herb as a charm.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, shady environments with consistently moist, rich soil. Replicate its native temperate forest conditions by providing partial to full shade and regular watering to maintain soil moisture. Fertilize sparingly with organic matter to support its moderate nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder, benefiting from a rich, organic soil; an annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient.
