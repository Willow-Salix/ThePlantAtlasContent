## Care Guide
Thriving in dry, open environments, Spreading Dogbane (var. glabrum) requires full sun and minimal watering, tolerating drought once established. It prefers lean soils, so fertilization is rarely needed. This hardy plant is best suited for low-maintenance, sunny garden spots with well-draining soil.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to leaner, less fertile soils found in its native grasslands and disturbed areas. Fertilization is generally not necessary and may even be detrimental.
