## 🌱 Overview
Dirina is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Roccellaceae. All Dirina species are crustose lichens with a whitish to greyish brown thallus, and live either on rock or on bark–some species can live on both. The photobiont partner is a member of the green algal genus Trentepohlia. Most species occur in the Northern Hemisphere, and are generally restricted to coastal habitats, where they may be locally quite common. Erythrin and lecanoric acid are lichen products that usually occur in Dirina species, along with several other unidentified substances.
The genus was circumscribed in 1825 by Elias Magnus Fries. Swedish lichenologist Anders Tehler published a monograph about the genus in 1983. Thirty years later, he and his colleagues revisited Dirina, combining evidence from molecular phylogenetic analysis with morphological and chemical analysis. They accepted 24 species in Dirina, 9 of which were described as new to science.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dirina hassei Zahlbr. is a saxicolous lichen found in coastal Mediterranean climates, typically on exposed rocks. It thrives in high light conditions, absorbing moisture directly from atmospheric humidity, rain, and fog, especially during cooler, wetter periods. No soil or traditional fertilization is needed, as it gathers nutrients directly from its environment and substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers; obtains all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rain) and its rock substrate.
