## 🧤 Care Instructions
This montane perennial thrives in full sun and requires well-drained soil, replicating its native rocky slope habitats. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly. It is quite hardy once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost annually in early spring is sufficient.
