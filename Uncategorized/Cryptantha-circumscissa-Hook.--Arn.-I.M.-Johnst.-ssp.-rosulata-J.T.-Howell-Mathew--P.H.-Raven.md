## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States, primarily California, extending to parts of Nevada, Oregon, Arizona, and Utah. |
| **Climate** | Arid Montane/Subalpine (encompassing yellow pine forests, red fir forests, alpine fell-fields, and sagebrush scrub) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low watering needs; highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, consistent with arid native conditions. |

## Introduction
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native arid montane and subalpine environments. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization. It is an excellent choice for xeriscaping or rocky garden beds.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. Native to lean, sandy, or gravelly soils, it thrives without rich nutrients. A very dilute, balanced fertilizer might be applied once annually in spring if grown in a container, but is generally not necessary in the ground.
