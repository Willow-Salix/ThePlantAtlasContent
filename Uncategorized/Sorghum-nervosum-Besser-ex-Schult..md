## Introduction
Sorghum bicolor, commonly called sorghum () and also known as broomcorn, great millet, Indian millet, Guinea corn, or jowar, is a species in the grass genus Sorghum cultivated chiefly for its grain.  The grain is used as food by humans, while the plant is used for animal feed and ethanol production. The stalk of sweet sorghum varieties, called sorgo or sorgho and taller than those grown for grain, can be used for forage or silage or crushed for juice that can be boiled down into edible syrup or fermented into ethanol.
Sorghum originated and was domesticated in Sudan, and is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is the world's fifth-most important cereal crop after rice, wheat, maize, and barley. It is typically an annual, but some cultivars are perennial. It grows in clumps that may reach over 4 metres (13 ft) high. The grain is small, 2 to 4 millimetres (0.08 to 0.2 in) in diameter.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and warm conditions, typical of its native African savannas. It prefers moderate watering and fertile soil to support robust growth, though it exhibits good drought tolerance once established.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to rich soil. Benefits from regular fertilization, especially nitrogen, during active growth periods.
