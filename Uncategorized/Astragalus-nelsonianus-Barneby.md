## 🧤 Care Instructions
Nelson's Milkvetch thrives in full sun and well-draining, poor soils, requiring minimal water. Mimic its arid, high desert native environment by providing ample light and very infrequent watering, with no need for rich fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Little to no fertilizer is needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-scarce conditions and, as a legume, fixes its own nitrogen.
