## 🌱 Overview
Bobea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It includes five species, four of which are endemic to Hawaii and one to eastern Queensland in Australia. Bobea was named for Jean-Baptiste Bobe-Moreau by Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupré in 1830 in his book Voyage de l'Uranie.
The wood of Bobea is hard, wearable, and yellow. It was used for the gunwales of Polynesian voyaging canoes. The gunwales of modern canoes are sometimes painted yellow in imitation of the wood that is no longer widely available.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in conditions mimicking its native wet to mesic forests, requiring consistent moisture and bright, indirect light. Ensure well-draining soil and provide moderate fertilization during its active growth periods to support healthy development, while protecting it from intense direct sun.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced, slow-release liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
