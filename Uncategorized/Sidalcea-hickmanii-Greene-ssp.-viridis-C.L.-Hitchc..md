## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Marin County, California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Coastal Grasslands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun along the coast, but benefits from some afternoon shade in hotter inland areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season (winter and spring); requires minimal to no supplemental water during its dry summer dormancy once established. |

## Introduction
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## Care Guide
Marin Checkerbloom thrives in well-draining soil and prefers full sun, tolerating some partial shade in hotter climates. It requires moderate water during its active growth in cooler months and should be kept dry during its summer dormancy. Minimal fertilization is needed, mimicking its native Mediterranean habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in soils that are not overly rich. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer may be applied in early spring if the soil is very poor, but is often not necessary.
