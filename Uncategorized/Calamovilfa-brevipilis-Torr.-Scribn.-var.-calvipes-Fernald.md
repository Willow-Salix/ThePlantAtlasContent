## Care Guide
This grass thrives in full to partial sun with consistently moist, acidic, and nutrient-poor sandy soils, typical of its native wet pine barren habitats. It requires minimal to no fertilization, preferring conditions that mimic its naturally harsh yet often damp environment.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic sandy soils.
