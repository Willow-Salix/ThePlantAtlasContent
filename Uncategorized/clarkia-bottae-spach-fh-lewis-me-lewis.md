## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (primarily South Coast Ranges, Transverse Ranges, and Peninsular Ranges) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, often found in grasslands, chaparral, and oak woodlands) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun for optimal flowering, tolerating light partial shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during its active growing season in spring, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce significantly or cease once summer approaches and the plant naturally senesces, as it is adapted to dry summer conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clarkia is a genus within the flowering plant family Onagraceae.  Over 40 species are currently classified in Clarkia; almost all are native to western North America, though one species (Clarkia tenella) is native to South America.
Clarkias are typically annual herbs, growing either prostrate or erect to a height of less than 2 metres.  Their leaves are small and simple, from 1 to 10 cm in length depending on the species.  Their flowers have four sepals and four petals, usually white, pink, or red, and are often spotted or streaked. Their fruit are elongated, cylindrical pods, usually 4-grooved or 8-grooved, and when mature they hold many tiny, cubical seeds.
Several members of the genus are sometimes referred to by the common name "godetia", including Clarkia amoena, Clarkia affinis, and Clarkia lassenensis (the Lassen godetia).  This is because they were formerly classified in a genus called Godetia, which is no longer recognised since its members have been absorbed into the genus Clarkia.  Older sources may still use Godetia as a genus name.
The genus was named in honour of the explorer Captain William Clark. Unofficially, the genus is sometimes referred to as Yorkia, in honor of York, an African-American member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.
The Royal Navy had a warship called HMS Clarkia, a Flower-class corvette.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Botta's Clarkia thrives in conditions mimicking its native Californian Mediterranean climate. Provide full sun exposure and moderate water during its active spring growth, allowing soil to dry between waterings. It prefers leaner soils with low fertilizer input and tolerates dry summer conditions well once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. It generally thrives in average to poor soils and does not require frequent feeding; excessive fertilizer can promote foliage over flowers.
