## Introduction

These are small perennial herbs endemic to serpentine soils of the Siskiyou-Klamath region in northern California and SW Oregon in the United States.

## Care Guide
Rushlilies prefer full sun to partial shade and moderate watering during their spring growth period, transitioning to drier conditions as they enter summer dormancy. They thrive in well-draining soil and benefit from light fertilization to support their seasonal blooms. Mimicking their native temperate grassland and woodland environment is key to their successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring as new growth emerges, especially in poorer soils.
