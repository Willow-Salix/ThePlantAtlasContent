# White-Green Bark Lichen

*Ditremis leucochlora (MÃ¼ll. Arg.) R.C. Harris* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America (e.g., Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela) and parts of tropical Africa. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect, low to moderate light. Avoid direct sunlight which can cause desiccation. Dappled light or bright shade is ideal, mimicking its epiphytic growth beneath a dense canopy. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity is crucial. Requires frequent misting or placement in a terrarium with consistently high moisture levels. While it needs moisture, ensure good air circulation to prevent stagnant conditions. |

## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in high humidity and indirect light, mirroring its native tropical rainforest habitat. Consistent moisture through frequent misting is vital, but avoid stagnant air. No traditional fertilization is needed as it obtains nutrients atmospherically.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. Lichens primarily derive nutrients from atmospheric dust, rain, and decaying organic matter on their substrate. Standard plant fertilizers are detrimental.
