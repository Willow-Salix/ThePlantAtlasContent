## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Yukon Territory, Canada |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, typical of high-altitude, treeless environments above the treeline. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season, ensuring exceptionally well-drained soil to mimic rocky alpine slopes. Allow soil to dry slightly between waterings; avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Draba is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, commonly known as whitlow-grasses (though they are not related to the true grasses).

## Care Guide
Kathul Mountain Draba thrives in full sun and requires exceptionally well-drained, gritty or rocky soil to mimic its native alpine tundra habitat. Water moderately during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and provide minimal to no fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental; a light, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring, or none at all, is sufficient.
