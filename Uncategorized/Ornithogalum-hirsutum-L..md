## Introduction
Ornithogalum is a genus  of perennial plants mostly native to southern Europe and southern Africa belonging to the family Asparagaceae. Some species are native to other areas such as the Caucasus. Some species are classified as noxious invasive weeds in some portions of North America. Growing from a bulb, species have linear basal leaves and a slender stalk, up to 30 cm tall, bearing clusters of typically white star-shaped flowers, often striped with green. The common name of the genus, star-of-Bethlehem, is based on its star-shaped flowers, after the Star of Bethlehem that appears in the biblical account of the birth of Jesus. The number of species has varied considerably, depending on authority, from 50 to 300.

## Care Guide
This bulbous plant thrives in bright light, mirroring its open native habitats. It requires moderate watering during its winter-spring active growth phase and a distinct dry period for summer dormancy. Provide light fertilization to support its seasonal growth.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization is recommended during the active growing season. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or a liquid feed at half strength monthly would be suitable.
