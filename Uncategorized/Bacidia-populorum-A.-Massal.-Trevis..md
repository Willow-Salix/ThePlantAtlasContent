## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of Europe and North America |
| **Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to indirect light; avoid intense, direct sunlight to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and regular atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, fog). Does not absorb water from soil; instead, it absorbs moisture directly from the air and the surface it grows on. For cultivation, regular misting or a humid environment would be crucial. |

## Introduction
Bacidia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. These lichens are characterised by their crustose growth form, distinctive club-shaped reproductive structures called apothecia that contain long, needle-like spores, and their symbiotic partnership with green algae. Bacidia species typically grow on various substrates including tree bark, rock surfaces, and occasionally soil, and are distinguished from related genera by their specific spore characteristics and internal structures.

## Care Guide
Bacidia populorum is a corticolous lichen thriving in humid, temperate forest environments, typically on tree bark. It requires partial shade and consistent atmospheric moisture, absorbing water and nutrients directly from the air and surface. This lichen is highly sensitive to air pollution and does not require traditional soil-based watering or fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Obtains all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rain) and decaying organic matter on the bark surface. No soil-based fertilizer is required, and excessive nutrients can be harmful.
