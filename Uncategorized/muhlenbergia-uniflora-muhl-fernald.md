## 🌱 Overview
Muhlenbergia is a genus of plants in the grass family.
The genus is named in honor of the German-American amateur botanist Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg (1753-1815). Many of the species are known by the common name muhly.
The greatest number are native to the southwestern United States and Mexico, but there are also native species in Canada, Central and South America and in Asia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bog Muhly thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently wet to waterlogged soil to mimic its native bog habitat. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic conditions, making supplemental fertilization largely unnecessary and potentially harmful. Maintain high moisture levels to ensure its success.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native bog environments are typically nutrient-poor, acidic soils, so this plant is adapted to low nutrient levels. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
