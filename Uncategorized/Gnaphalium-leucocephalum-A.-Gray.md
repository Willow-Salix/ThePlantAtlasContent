## Care Guide
This resilient, drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry completely between applications to prevent rot. Fertilization is rarely necessary.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and generally does not require fertilization.
