Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This North American prairie native thrives in full sun and well-draining, consistently moist soil during its growth period. It requires minimal fertilization and tolerates some drought once established. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overly wet conditions to prevent issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to rich soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, or none if planted in rich soil.
