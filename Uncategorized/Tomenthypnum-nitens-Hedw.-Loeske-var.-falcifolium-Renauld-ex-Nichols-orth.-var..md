## Care Guide
This moss thrives in consistently wet conditions with high humidity, mimicking its native boreal fenland habitat. Provide moderate, indirect light and minimal fertilization for optimal growth, ensuring the substrate never dries out.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses have minimal nutrient demands. A highly diluted, infrequent application of a balanced fertilizer, if any, is sufficient, but often not necessary.
