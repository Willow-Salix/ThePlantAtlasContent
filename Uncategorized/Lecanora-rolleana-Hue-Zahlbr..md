## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Alpine regions, including mountainous areas of Europe (e.g., Alps, Scandinavia), North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Canadian Arctic), and parts of Asia (e.g., Himalayas). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Arctic Tundra, often found on exposed siliceous rocks. |
| **Sunlight** | High, direct sun exposure. Adapted to intense light and high UV radiation prevalent in exposed alpine and arctic environments. |
| **Watering** | Relies on atmospheric moisture (rain, snowmelt, dew) rather than substrate moisture. Tolerates desiccation and requires infrequent, thorough wetting events followed by dry periods. |

## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in harsh, exposed alpine and arctic conditions, requiring full sun and tolerating extreme temperatures. It absorbs moisture directly from the air and rock surface, needing no soil or conventional fertilizer, only occasional wetting events followed by dry periods.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Nutrients are acquired from the atmosphere (dust, precipitation) and the rock substrate; very low nutrient requirements.
