| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun but can tolerate partial shade, ensuring good light exposure for best growth and flowering. |

## Introduction
Acacia, commonly known as wattles or acacias, is a genus of about 1,084 species of shrubs and trees in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the pea family Fabaceae. Initially, it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa, South America, and Australasia, but is now reserved for species mainly from Australia, with others from New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. The genus name is Neo-Latin, borrowed from Koine Greek ἀκακία (akakia), a term used in antiquity to describe a preparation extracted from Vachellia nilotica, the original type species.
Several species of Acacia have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established.

## Care Guide
Myrtle Wattle is a resilient plant thriving in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. It's drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and very low fertilizer input, particularly avoiding high phosphorus.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer specifically formulated for native plants if necessary, or none at all.
