| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Northern California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Coniferous Forest / Coastal Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to dappled sun. Prefers protection from intense afternoon sun, especially in warmer climates, mimicking its understory or forest edge habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil. Water regularly, ensuring the soil does not dry out completely between waterings, reflecting the moderate to high rainfall of its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Campanula () is the type genus of the Campanulaceae family of flowering plants. Campanula are commonly known as bellflowers and take both their common and scientific names from the bell-shaped flowers—campanula is Latin for "little bell".
The genus includes over 500 species and several subspecies, distributed across the temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with centers of diversity in the Mediterranean region, Balkans, Caucasus and mountains of western Asia. The range also extends into mountains in tropical regions of Asia and Africa.

The species include annual, biennial and perennial plants, and vary in habit from dwarf arctic and alpine species under 5 cm high, to large temperate grassland and woodland species growing to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pale Bellflower thrives in conditions that mimic its native Pacific Northwest woodland habitat. Provide partial shade, consistently moist, well-drained soil, and moderate fertility to ensure healthy growth. Protect it from harsh afternoon sun and ensure regular watering without waterlogging.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderately rich, well-drained soil. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost annually in spring will support its growth in nutrient-rich forest floor conditions.
