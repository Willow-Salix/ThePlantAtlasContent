## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Santa Cruz Mountains, California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters), often found in chaparral or coastal scrub environments on well-drained, often nutrient-poor soils. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight per day) to thrive, reflecting its natural exposure in open, often coastal, habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires regular watering during its first few years to establish a strong root system. Afterwards, water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially adapted to dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
The Santa Cruz cypress (Hesperocyparis abramsiana; formerly classified as Cupressus abramsiana) is a species of North American tree within the cypress family. The species is endemic to the Santa Cruz Mountains within the Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties of west-central California. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the species on the Endangered Species Act in 1987 due to increasing threats from habitat loss and disruption of natural forest fire regimes. In 2016, the conservation status of the Santa Cruz cypress changed to Threatened. The cited reasoning was a decrease in threats against their habitat.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Santa Cruz Cypress flourishes in full sun and well-drained, even nutrient-poor, soils. It is highly drought-tolerant once mature, needing infrequent watering. Avoid over-fertilizing as it naturally adapts to lean conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This variety is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, including serpentine soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental. If growth is exceptionally poor, a very light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be considered.
