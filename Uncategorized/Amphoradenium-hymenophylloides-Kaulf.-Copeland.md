# Hymenophylloides Filmy Fern

*Amphoradenium hymenophylloides (Kaulf.) Copeland* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Americas, specifically parts of Central America (e.g., Costa Rica, Panama), the Caribbean (e.g., Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola), and northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru). |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforests and Cloud Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to deep shade. Avoid any direct sunlight, which will quickly damage the delicate fronds. Prefers indirect, filtered light. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant moisture and extremely high humidity (ideally 70-90% or more). The growing medium should never be allowed to dry out, and atmospheric moisture is crucial for its survival. Best suited for terrariums or humid vivariums. |

## Care Guide
This delicate filmy fern thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest and cloud forest habitats: consistently high humidity, constant moisture, and very low light. It requires a humid enclosure like a terrarium to prevent desiccation and minimal fertilization due to its sensitivity.

### Fertilizer
Very minimal to none. If fertilized, use a highly diluted (1/8 to 1/10 strength) liquid fertilizer sparingly, perhaps once a month during active growth. These plants are sensitive to salt build-up.
