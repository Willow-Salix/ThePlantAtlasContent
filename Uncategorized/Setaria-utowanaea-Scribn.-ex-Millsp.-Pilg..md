## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caribbean region (Cuba, Bahamas, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Lesser Antilles), Florida (USA), Yucatán Peninsula (Mexico), Central America |
| **Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Dry Forest, Grassland, and Coastal Scrub |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun, tolerating partial sun. Prefers open, brightly lit conditions. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Can tolerate periods of drought once established, especially in well-draining soil common in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Setaria is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family. The name is derived from the Latin word seta, meaning "bristle" or "hair", which refers to the bristly spikelets.
The genus includes over 100 species distributed in many tropical and temperate regions around the world, and members are commonly known as foxtail or bristle grasses.

## Care Guide
Provide this bristlegrass with full to partial sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Caribbean and Central American habitats. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and fertilize lightly during its active growth for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season would be sufficient, but it generally thrives in less fertile soils.
