## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across the Northern Hemisphere, including temperate and boreal regions of Europe, North America (especially eastern parts), and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate and Boreal Forests, Bogs, and Wet Woodlands (e.g., Northern Coniferous Forest Biome). |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light; prefers deep shade or consistently filtered, indirect light, mimicking its natural habitat on the forest floor under dense canopy. |
| **Watering** | Extremely high and consistent moisture; substrate must be kept constantly moist to wet, never allowing it to dry out. High ambient humidity is crucial. |

## Care Guide
This liverwort requires consistently moist, highly humid, and deeply shaded conditions, replicating its natural bog and woodland floor environment. Ensure the substrate never dries out and provide very low light, avoiding direct sun. No fertilization is needed.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic environments such as peat or decaying wood, and can be harmed by excessive nutrients.
