## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Lihau Island, Hawaii, USA |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Shrubland / Coastal Cliff |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring direct, unfiltered light for most of the day due to its exposed native habitat on cliffs and in dry shrubland. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, mirroring its adaptation to periods of low rainfall. |

## Introduction
Schiedea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It contains 35 species which are endemic to Hawaii.
The 35th species was spotted in 2016 by Tom DeMent while surveying a forest near Laupāhoehoe on Hawai‘i Island. It was named S. haakoaensis in 2022.

## Care Guide
This critically endangered Hawaiian plant requires full sun and excellent drainage, thriving in conditions mimicking its native dry shrubland and cliff habitat. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between applications, and use fertilizer very sparingly, if at all.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Its native environment suggests adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, so a very dilute, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly during active growth, if any, is sufficient.
