## Care Guide
Fendler's Mountain Pennycress thrives in cool, mountainous conditions with full to partial sun and well-draining, lean soil. Provide regular watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and use fertilizer sparingly to mimic its native alpine habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer; prefers lean to moderately fertile soil, reflecting its native habitat where nutrient levels are not excessively high.
