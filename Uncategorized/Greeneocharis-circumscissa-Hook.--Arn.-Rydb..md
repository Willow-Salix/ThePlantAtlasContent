| **Native Origin** | Western North America (California, Nevada, Arizona, Baja California), primarily the Mojave Desert region. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |

## Introduction
Greeneocharis  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. There are two species, and it has a disjunct distribution in the western United States and northwestern Mexico in North America and western Argentina in southern South America. It is part of subtribe of Amsinckiinae.
It was once thought to be a either a subgenus or synonym of Cryptantha Lehm. ex G. Don, before being segregated out due to molecular phylogenetic analysis.

## Care Guide
Mojave Spineflower thrives in dry, hot, and sunny conditions, mirroring its native desert environment. Provide full sun and water very sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Fertilization is generally not required for this drought-adapted plant.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Its native desert soils are typically poor in nutrients, so rich soil or frequent feeding is unnecessary.
