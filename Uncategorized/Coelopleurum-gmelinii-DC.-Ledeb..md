# Gmelin's Sea-parsley

*Coelopleurum gmelinii (DC.) Ledeb.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions of the Russian Far East (e.g., Kamchatka, Sakhalin), Japan (Hokkaido), and North America (Alaska, Aleutian Islands, Pacific Northwest). |
| **Climate** | Cold Temperate Coastal / Subarctic Maritime Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun. It thrives in open, exposed coastal environments. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil. Its native habitat receives regular rainfall and often experiences fog, so it prefers constant moisture without being waterlogged. |

## Care Guide
This hardy coastal plant thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained conditions, mimicking its subarctic coastal habitat. Provide it with full to partial sun exposure and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but not waterlogged. Fertilize lightly to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization, primarily in spring. Its native coastal soils are not typically extremely rich, so heavy feeding is unnecessary.
