## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Bahama Sachsia thrives in bright, sunny conditions reminiscent of its native tropical home in the Bahamas. It prefers consistently moist soil, especially during warmer months, but should not be waterlogged. Regular feeding during its active growth period will promote robust flowering and overall plant health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season (spring through summer). Use a slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring for sustained nutrient release.
