## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains and surrounding ranges in the United States, including Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, and Montana) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine Meadow / Montane Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in high light exposure typical of open mountain meadows. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to high watering, ensuring consistent moisture during the growing season. Requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot, as native soils are often well-drained from snowmelt and rain. |

## Introduction
Campanula () is the type genus of the Campanulaceae family of flowering plants. Campanula are commonly known as bellflowers and take both their common and scientific names from the bell-shaped flowers—campanula is Latin for "little bell".
The genus includes over 500 species and several subspecies, distributed across the temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with centers of diversity in the Mediterranean region, Balkans, Caucasus and mountains of western Asia. The range also extends into mountains in tropical regions of Asia and Africa.

The species include annual, biennial and perennial plants, and vary in habit from dwarf arctic and alpine species under 5 cm high, to large temperate grassland and woodland species growing to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall.

## Care Guide
Parry's Bellflower thrives in conditions mimicking its native subalpine meadows: full to partial sun and consistent moisture during the growing season. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging, and provide light to moderate nutrients. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or meadow-like settings.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization, or incorporation of organic matter. Prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soil.
