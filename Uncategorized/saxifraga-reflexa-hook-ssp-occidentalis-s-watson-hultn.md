## 🌱 Overview
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Western Saxifrage thrives in conditions mimicking its native alpine habitats, requiring full to partial sun and extremely well-drained, lean soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid over-fertilization to ensure robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; thrives in lean, rocky, or gritty soils.
