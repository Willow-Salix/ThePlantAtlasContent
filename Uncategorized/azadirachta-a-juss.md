| **🌍 Origin** | Indian subcontinent (India, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Pakistan), parts of Southeast Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Dry Forests, Semi-Arid Scrublands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its open-canopy native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established, mirroring its native climate's distinct wet and dry seasons. Water regularly when young, but reduce frequency for mature trees, allowing soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Azadirachta indica, commonly known as neem, margosa, nimtree or Indian lilac, is a tree in the mahogany family Meliaceae. It is one of the two species in the genus Azadirachta. It is native to the Indian subcontinent and to parts of Southeast Asia, but is naturalized and grown around the world in tropical and subtropical areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Neem tree thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its origins in hot, dry tropical regions. Once established, it is remarkably drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering and fertilization. Ensure ample sunlight and avoid overwatering for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low, as it thrives in nutrient-poor and sandy soils in its native range. Minimal or no fertilization is usually required, especially for established trees.
