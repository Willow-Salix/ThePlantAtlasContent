## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry to Mesic Forests and Coastal Environments |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade; tolerates high light levels, but may appreciate some afternoon shade in intense heat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the top soil to dry out between waterings; requires more frequent watering during active growth and less during cooler, drier periods. |

## Introduction
Lysimachia ( LY-sim-AY-kee-ə) is a genus consisting of 182 accepted species of flowering plants traditionally classified in the family Primulaceae. Based on a molecular phylogenetic study it was transferred to the family Myrsinaceae, before this family was later merged into the Primulaceae.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in environments mimicking its native tropical dry to mesic forests and coastal areas. Provide full sun to partial shade and moderate watering, ensuring the soil dries slightly between sessions. Fertilize lightly during the active growing season to avoid over-enrichment.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season; native to environments where excessive nutrients are uncommon.
