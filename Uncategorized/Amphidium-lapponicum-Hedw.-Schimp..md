## Care Guide
To care for Lapland Amphidium Moss, provide cool temperatures, high humidity, and consistent moisture with good drainage, mimicking its rocky, often shaded, alpine or arctic habitats. Protect it from direct sun and avoid any significant fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to none. Mosses have very minimal nutrient needs, absorbing what they require from water and the environment. High fertilizer concentrations can be detrimental.
