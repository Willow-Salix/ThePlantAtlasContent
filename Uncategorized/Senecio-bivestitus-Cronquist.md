## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in bright light and consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native subalpine meadows. Provide adequate water during its growing season, ensuring excellent drainage to prevent root rot, and minimize water during dormancy. Minimal fertilization is typically sufficient.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly during early growing season, or none if the soil is naturally rich in organic matter.
