## Introduction
Hypochaeris is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae. Many species are known as cat's ear. These are annual and perennial herbs generally bearing flower heads with yellow ray florets. These plants may resemble or be confused with dandelions and so some are called false dandelions.
Estimates of the number of species range from about 50   up to about 100. Most species are native to South America, but some are found in Eurasia and North Africa.

## Care Guide
Smallhead Cat's Ear is a resilient grassland plant that thrives in full sun exposure. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. This species is relatively easy to care for, preferring well-draining soil and open conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year in spring if growth seems weak, but it is generally not a heavy feeder.
