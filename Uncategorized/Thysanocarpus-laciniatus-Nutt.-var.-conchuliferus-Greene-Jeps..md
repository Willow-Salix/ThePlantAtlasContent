## Introduction
Thysanocarpus is a small genus of plants in the family Brassicaceae known generally as fringepods or lacepods. These are small, erect annual herbs. The flat fruit capsule is generally round or oval-shaped with a wing that goes all the way around the pod, giving it a fringed look. The fruits hang from most of the length of the stem. The plants are native to the western United States, British Columbia, and northwestern Mexico.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. Provide moderate water during its spring growing season, then allow it to dry out as it is drought-tolerant. Fertilization needs are minimal.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied once during its active growth if desired, but often not necessary.
