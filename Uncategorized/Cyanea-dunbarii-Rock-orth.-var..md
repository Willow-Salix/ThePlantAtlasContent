## Care Guide
Cyanea dunbarii requires a highly humid environment with consistent moisture and protection from direct sun, mimicking its native Hawaiian wet forest habitat. Ensure well-draining soil and water regularly, never allowing the soil to dry out completely. Feed sparingly with a dilute fertilizer during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer during the growing season. Its native forest soils are often rich in organic matter but can also be leached, suggesting a need for consistent, gentle nutrient replenishment.
