## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and arid conditions, requiring minimal water once established and preferring lean, well-draining soil. As a hemiparasite, it often benefits from the presence of host plants like native grasses or forbs in its root zone. Avoid over-fertilizing.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils and can be harmed by rich soil or excessive fertilization.
