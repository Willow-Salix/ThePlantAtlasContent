## 🌱 Overview
Flueggea, the bushweeds, is a genus of shrubs and trees in the family Phyllanthaceae first described as a genus in 1806. It is widespread across much of Asia, Africa, and various oceanic islands, with a few species in South America and on the Iberian Peninsula.
The genus is named after John Fluegge, a German cryptogamic botanist.
Members of this genus all have entire ovate leaves and minute green flowers that form at the leaf axils in the form of fascicles or cymes. The fruits are berries, of the size of peas. With the exception of F. verrucosa, F. spirei, and occasionally F. virosa, they are dioecious.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Common Bushweed thrives in bright light conditions, from full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native open woodland habitats. It requires regular watering to maintain consistent moisture, especially during its growing period, but can withstand periods of drought. Minimal fertilization is needed, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during active growth; not a heavy feeder and adapts well to average soil fertility.
