## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (for Tilia americana), and widespread across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere (for the genus Tilia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. As a large canopy tree, it typically requires ample light to thrive, though young trees can tolerate some shade. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil. Its native climate experiences regular rainfall, so it does not tolerate prolonged dry periods but also dislikes waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Tilia americana is a species of tree in the family Malvaceae, native to eastern North America, from southeast Manitoba east to New Brunswick, southwest to northeast Oklahoma, southeast to South Carolina, and west along the Niobrara River to Cherry County, Nebraska. It is the sole representative of its genus in the Western Hemisphere, assuming T. caroliniana is treated as a subspecies or local ecotype of T. americana. Common names include American basswood and American linden.

## Care Guide
Basswood thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring consistently moist, well-drained, and nutrient-rich soil. Mimic its native temperate forest environment by ensuring adequate hydration and fertility to support its robust growth as a large shade tree.

### Fertilizer
Prefers rich, fertile soil, reflective of the humus-rich forest floors where it naturally grows. Benefits from an annual application of balanced fertilizer or compost.
