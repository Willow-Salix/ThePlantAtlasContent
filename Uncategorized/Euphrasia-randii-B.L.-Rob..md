## Introduction
Euphrasia, or eyebright, is a genus of about 215 species of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae (formerly included in the Scrophulariaceae), with a cosmopolitan distribution. They are hemiparasitic on grasses and other plants. Both the common and generic names refer to the plant's use in a lotion for treating eye infections, with Euphrasia literally meaning 'good-cheer'.
Many species are found in alpine or sub-alpine meadows where snow is common. Flowers usually are borne terminally, are zygomorphic, and have a lower petal shaped like a lip. The most common flower colours are purple, blue-white, and violet. Some species have yellow markings on the lower petal to act as a guide to pollinating insects.
Alternative names, mainly in herbalism, are Augentrostkraut, Euphrasiae herba, Herba Euphrasiae and Herbe d'Euphraise.

## Care Guide
Small Eyebright thrives in consistently moist, nutrient-poor soils, characteristic of its native temperate wetland and bog habitats. Provide ample direct sunlight and ensure the soil remains wet, as it is intolerant of dry conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers nutrient-poor to average soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
