## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern United States (White Mountains of New Hampshire and Maine, Adirondack Mountains of New York) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra/Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (requires high light exposure typical of exposed alpine slopes). |
| **Watering** | Regular watering during the growing season to maintain consistent moisture, but excellent drainage is crucial to prevent waterlogging. Mimics snowmelt and frequent mountain rain. |

## Introduction
Prenanthes is a genus of plant in the family Asteraceae, often referred to as rattlesnake root.
Molecular analysis in 2009 revealed that the genus as traditionally envisioned was polyphyletic, meaning that it is a conglomeration of species not closely related to one another. The genus formerly included species now placed in Aetheorhiza, Askellia, Brickellia, Chondrilla, Crepidiastrum, Crepis, Emilia, Erythroseris, Faberia, Hololeion, Hypochaeris, Ixeris, Lactuca, Lapsanastrum, Launaea, Lygodesmia, Nabalus, Notoseris, Paraprenanthes, Parasenecio, Picrosia, Sonchella, Sonchus, Soroseris, Stephanomeria, Trixis, and Youngia.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native high-altitude habitat, requiring full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Avoid rich fertilizers and ensure adequate air circulation to prevent fungal issues. It's a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range due to specific environmental needs.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; alpine soils are typically lean and nutrient-poor. An occasional light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer may be beneficial if growth is sluggish.
