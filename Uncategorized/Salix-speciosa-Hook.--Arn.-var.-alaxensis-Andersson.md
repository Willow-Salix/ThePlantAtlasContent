## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions of North America (Alaska, Yukon, Northwest Territories, northern British Columbia, Quebec, Labrador) and northeastern Asia (Siberia, Russian Far East). |
| **Climate** | Subarctic and Boreal Forest biomes, often in riparian zones, wetlands, or moist tundra. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun, thriving in environments with long daylight hours during the growing season. Tolerates partial sun but may have reduced vigor. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil. Naturally found along streams, rivers, and in wetlands, indicating a need for abundant and consistent water availability. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
The Feltleaf Willow thrives in cold, wet environments, demanding consistently moist to wet soil and plenty of sunlight. It is a hardy plant well-suited for northern climates and riparian restoration, requiring minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant is adapted to relatively nutrient-poor soils common in its native range. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring may benefit growth, especially in very poor soils or containers.
