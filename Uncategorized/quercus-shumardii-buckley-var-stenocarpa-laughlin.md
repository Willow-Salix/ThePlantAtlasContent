## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern and Central United States |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for optimal growth and health, typical for a canopy tree in its native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is crucial for young and establishing trees, mimicking moderate forest rainfall; allow the soil surface to dry slightly between waterings. Mature trees are quite drought-tolerant once established but benefit from supplemental water during extended dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Quercus shumardii, the Shumard oak, spotted oak, Schneck oak, Shumard red oak, or swamp red oak, is one of the largest of the oak species in the red oak group (Quercus section Lobatae).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Shumard Oak thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its natural temperate forest environment. While consistent watering is vital for young trees, mature oaks display good drought tolerance. Fertilization needs are moderate, primarily aiding young plant establishment and general soil health with organic amendments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Young trees benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring to support establishment. Established trees in healthy, rich soil often do not require regular fertilization, but a top dressing of compost can enhance soil fertility.
