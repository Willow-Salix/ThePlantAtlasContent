## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Canada (Newfoundland, Labrador), USA (Alaska), Greenland, Russia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Boreal Forest to Subarctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. Avoid intense, direct sun, especially during warmer periods, to prevent desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high humidity and frequent misting with clean (distilled or rainwater) to rehydrate. Allow periods of complete dryness between rewetting; avoid prolonged saturation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations.
Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).
Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.
Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dunes, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.
Larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes continuella, feed on Cladonia species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, humid conditions with bright, indirect light. Provide high atmospheric moisture through frequent misting with clean water, allowing it to dry out periodically. Absolutely no fertilization is needed, as it is highly sensitive to external nutrients and mineral salts.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; lichens are highly sensitive to mineral salts and nutrients, which can be detrimental to their health.
