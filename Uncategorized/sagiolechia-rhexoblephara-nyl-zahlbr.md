## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of South America (e.g., Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia), Central America (e.g., Costa Rica), and Southeast Asia (e.g., Vietnam). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforests and Cloud Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light; thrives in shaded, dappled conditions typical of a dense forest understory. Direct sunlight should be avoided. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and frequent moisture; obtains water from mist, rainfall, and atmospheric moisture. Avoid complete drying out but ensure good air circulation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sagiolechia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Sagiolechiaceae. These lichens form either extremely thin crusts within their substrate or live parasitically on other lichens without forming their own thallus. The genus is characterised by distinctive black, glossy fruiting bodies that begin embedded within the host material and later erupt to the surface, often developing elaborate folded or star-like forms. Sagiolechia contains six species found in diverse locations including Alaska, Greenland, Norway, and Madeira, with most species being quite rare and relatively recently discovered.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sagiolechia rhexoblephara is a tropical lichen demanding a consistently humid environment with regular moisture, akin to its native rainforest and cloud forest habitats. It requires low to indirect light and obtains nutrients from the atmosphere, thus no traditional fertilization is needed. Maintaining high humidity and good air circulation are crucial for its successful care.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients directly from the atmosphere, rainfall, and their substrate.
