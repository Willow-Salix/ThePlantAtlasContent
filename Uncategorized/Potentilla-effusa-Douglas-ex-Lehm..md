## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including much of the Western United States (e.g., Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Arizona, California, New Mexico) and parts of Western Canada (e.g., British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. This plant thrives in open areas, indicating a need for at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Reflecting its prairie origins, it prefers well-drained soil and is tolerant of periods of drought once established. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings. |

## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
Branched Cinquefoil thrives in full to partial sun with moderate watering, preferring well-drained soil that can dry out between waterings. It is generally low-maintenance, requiring minimal fertilization and exhibiting good drought tolerance once established, reflecting its origins in temperate North American grasslands.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a plant of grasslands and open, often less fertile soils, it typically does not require heavy feeding. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if growth is poor.
