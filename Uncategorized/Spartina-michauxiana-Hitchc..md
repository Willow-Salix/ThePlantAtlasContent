## Care Guide
Prairie Cordgrass is a resilient wetland plant that thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet to moist soil, even tolerating temporary flooding. It is generally a low-maintenance grass, needing only low to moderate fertilization to flourish in appropriate environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it's adapted to often nutrient-rich wetland soils but can benefit from occasional fertilization in poorer conditions.
