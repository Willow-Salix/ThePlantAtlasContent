| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia |
| **Climate** | Temperate regions, found in a variety of environments from coastal to inland, often in areas with nutrient enrichment |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade, often found in exposed locations on trees, wood, or rocks, thriving where light is abundant. |
| **Watering** | As a lichen, it absorbs moisture directly from rainfall, dew, or atmospheric humidity. Requires regular wetting interspersed with dry periods to prevent rot, mirroring natural temperate rainfall patterns. |

## Care Guide
Orange Wall Lichen thrives in well-lit, exposed environments typical of temperate regions, requiring no soil or conventional watering. Provide regular exposure to moisture (rain, mist) followed by dry periods. This hardy species needs no fertilizer, acquiring all nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air and precipitation, and this species is known for its tolerance to atmospheric nutrient enrichment.
