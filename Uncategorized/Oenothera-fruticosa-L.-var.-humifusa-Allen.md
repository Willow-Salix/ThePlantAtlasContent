## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (specifically coastal plains from North Carolina to Florida) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coastal Plain |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low to Moderate; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it's adapted to well-drained, sandy soils and can tolerate some drought. |

## Introduction
Oenothera is a genus of about 145 species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas. It is the type genus of the family Onagraceae.  Common names include evening primrose, suncups, and sundrops. They are not closely related to the true primroses (genus Primula).

## Care Guide
Oenothera fruticosa var. humifusa thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, characteristic of its native coastal plain environment. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and provide minimal fertilization to mimic its natural, lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; its native sandy soils are typically lean, so it thrives without heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer once in spring is sufficient.
