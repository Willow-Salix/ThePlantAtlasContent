## Care Guide
This annual wildflower thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its native Mediterranean climate. Provide moderate water during its spring growing season, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Minimal to no fertilizer is required, as rich soil can hinder flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant thrives in average to poor soil; excessive fertilization can reduce flowering.
