## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate and boreal montane regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe (e.g., Alps, Pyrenees) and North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Pacific Northwest) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Alpine |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure. This lichen thrives on exposed rock surfaces, tolerating direct sunlight but also found in bright, indirect light within rock crevices. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular atmospheric moisture (from rain, mist, or high humidity) for rehydration, but tolerates significant dry periods. It absorbs water directly from the air, not from soil. |

## Care Guide
Provide high light conditions and consistent atmospheric moisture through misting or high ambient humidity, allowing for dry periods between wetting. Ensure excellent air circulation and absolutely avoid soil or fertilizer, as this lichen is adapted to exposed, nutrient-poor rocky substrates.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens are highly sensitive to nutrient enrichment and thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Fertilizer would likely be detrimental.
