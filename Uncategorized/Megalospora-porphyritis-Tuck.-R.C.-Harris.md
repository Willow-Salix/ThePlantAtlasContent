| **Climate** | Humid Temperate Forest to Subtropical Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; thrives in shaded or dappled light conditions typical of a forest understory. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent high humidity and frequent moisture; mimicking regular rainfall and high atmospheric moisture, often through misting or a humid environment. Avoid drying out completely. |

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its native humid forest or cloud forest habitat. Provide low to medium indirect light, consistent high humidity, and regular moisture. Avoid direct sun and ensure a clean, stable substrate for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Not typically required. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air, rain, and their substrate; supplemental fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful.
