## Introduction
Sonchus is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Cichorieae within the family Asteraceae and are commonly known as sow thistles (less commonly hare thistles or hare lettuces). Sowthistles are annual, biennial or perennial herbs, with or without rhizomes and a few are even woody (subgenus Dendrosonchus, restricted to the Canary Islands and Madeira).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions similar to its native Hawaiian moist forests, preferring partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide moderate fertilization during active growth to encourage healthy foliage. High humidity is also beneficial.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season, to support lush growth in nutrient-rich forest soils.
