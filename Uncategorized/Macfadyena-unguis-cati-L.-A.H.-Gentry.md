| **Native Origin** | Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America (Neotropics) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Dry and Moist Broadleaf Forests, and Savannas |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers bright light for vigorous growth and abundant flowering, mimicking its presence in forest edges and open areas. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering during the growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry out between waterings. Its native climate with wet and dry seasons suggests it is tolerant of some drought once established. |

## Care Guide
Catclawvine thrives in bright light and requires regular watering during its active growth, with tolerance for short dry periods once established. Provide moderate fertilization to support its vigorous climbing nature, reflecting its adaptability to various conditions in its native tropical and subtropical habitats.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid or slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer) to support its vigorous climbing habit.
