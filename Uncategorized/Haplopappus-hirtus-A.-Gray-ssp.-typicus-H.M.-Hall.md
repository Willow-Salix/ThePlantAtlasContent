| **Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Coastal Sage Scrub |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **Watering** | Low; drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during summer. Can tolerate more moisture during cooler, wetter seasons if soil drains well. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean climate. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, preferring dry conditions. Fertilization is typically unnecessary, making it a low-maintenance choice for arid or semi-arid gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean, well-draining soil. Fertilization is generally not required, or a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring if growth seems stunted.
