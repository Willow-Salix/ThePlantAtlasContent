## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal: Northern Europe (Scandinavia, UK, Iceland), North America (Canada, northern USA, especially Appalachian Mountains and Great Lakes region), and Asia (Siberia, China, Japan). |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate/Boreal Rocky Outcrops and Alpine Areas |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. In its native habitats, it often grows on exposed rock faces where it receives significant light but can be found in partial shade within crevices or at forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the substrate to dry slightly between waterings. Native to well-drained rock crevices, it requires excellent drainage and is susceptible to root rot if waterlogged. |

## Introduction
Woodsia ilvensis, commonly known as oblong woodsia, is a fern found in North America and northern Eurasia. Also known as rusty woodsia or rusty cliff fern, it is typically found on sunny, exposed cliffs and rocky slopes and on thin, dry, acidic soils.

## Care Guide
The Rusty Woodsia thrives in cool conditions characteristic of its native rocky, exposed northern habitats. It requires bright indirect to partial sun and moderate watering, allowing the substrate to dry slightly between applications. This fern tolerates nutrient-poor soil and benefits from excellent drainage to prevent rot.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Growing in nutrient-poor rock crevices, it does not require rich soil. If fertilized, use a very diluted, balanced solution sparingly once a year in spring.
