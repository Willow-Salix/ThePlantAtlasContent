## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Musk Fern requires consistent moisture, high humidity, and indirect light to mimic its native tropical rainforest habitat. Provide light fertilization during the warmer months, ensuring the soil remains moist but never waterlogged.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a diluted liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring/summer). As an epiphyte/lithophyte, it naturally draws nutrients from decaying matter and does not require heavy fertilization.
