## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically high-elevation regions of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges in California, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington (USA). |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its exposure in high-altitude, open landscapes with intense solar radiation. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent to moderate watering. Prefers well-drained soil and tolerates drought once established, but benefits from consistent moisture during its active growing season (spring/early summer), typically from snowmelt. Highly susceptible to root rot in waterlogged conditions. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Dwarf mountain lupine thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native alpine environment. It requires infrequent to moderate watering, tolerating drought once established, but is highly sensitive to overwatering and rich, heavy soils. Avoid nitrogen fertilizers as it fixes its own nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes its own nitrogen from the air. Supplemental nitrogen fertilizer is generally unnecessary and can hinder flowering, thriving instead in lean, even rocky, soils.
