## Care Guide
This alpine plant requires full sun exposure and extremely well-drained soil that remains consistently moist, especially during its short growing season. It thrives in lean conditions, so avoid heavy fertilization. Mimic its native high-altitude environment to ensure success.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, as it is adapted to lean, rocky, nutrient-poor alpine soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
