## Care Guide
This forest floor plant requires consistent moisture and a location in full to part shade, avoiding direct sun exposure. It thrives in rich, organic soil that mimics its native woodland habitat. Ensure good drainage while maintaining regular soil moisture, especially during active growth periods.

### Fertilizer
Prefers rich, organic soil. Amend with compost or leaf mold annually. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can promote vigorous growth.
