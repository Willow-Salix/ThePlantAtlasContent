## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Dry Forest/Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with its open pineland and scrub native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent to moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings; highly drought-tolerant once established due to its adaptation to sandy, well-draining soils. |

## Introduction
Coursetia is a genus of flowering plant in the pea family, Fabaceae. Members of the genus, commonly known as babybonnets, are shrubs and small trees native to the Southwestern United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America as far south as Brazil and Peru. The genus is named for French botanist Georges Louis Marie Dumont de Courset (1746–1824).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its native open pineland and scrub habitat. It prefers infrequent watering, especially once established, due to its adaptation to sandy, well-draining soils. Minimal fertilizer is needed, benefiting from its natural ability to fix nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen and thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils, so supplemental fertilization is rarely needed.
