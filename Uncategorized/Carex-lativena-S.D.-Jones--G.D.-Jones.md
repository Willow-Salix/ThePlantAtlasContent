## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
The Broadvein Sedge thrives in conditions mirroring its native humid subtropical forests and wetlands of the Southeastern U.S. It requires consistently moist to wet soil and prefers partial shade to dappled sun exposure. Regular watering is crucial, while fertilizer needs are moderate.

### Fertilizer
