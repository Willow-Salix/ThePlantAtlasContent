## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Great Basin region of the United States (e.g., Nevada, Utah, Arizona) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open desert/scrubland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering; allow soil to dry completely between waterings, mimicking drought conditions of its native arid climate. |

## Introduction
Camissonia, sometimes commonly known as sun cup or sundrop, is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the evening primrose family Onagraceae. A total of 12 species are known, nearly all from western North America, especially in the California Floristic Province, but also one from South America. Previous circumscriptions of the genus had recognized up to 62 species before it was split among other closely related genera.
The flowers generally open at dawn and are yellow. They are usually cup-shaped, thus the common name.
Formerly included in Oenothera, the species of Camissonia are distinguished by having a club- or head-shaped stigma, instead of the 4-part-divided stigma of Oenothera or Clarkia.
Camissonia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia cupes and Schinia deserticola, both of which feed on C. claviformis, the latter exclusively.
The genus is named after the botanist Adelbert von Chamisso.

## Care Guide
To care for the Paiute Suncup, replicate its native arid scrubland environment by providing full sun and allowing the soil to dry out completely between infrequent, deep waterings. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization, as this plant thrives in lean, well-draining conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, as it is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor sandy or gravelly soils found in its native habitat.
