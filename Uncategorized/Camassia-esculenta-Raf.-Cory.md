## Care Guide
This plant prefers full sun to partial shade, especially during its spring growth phase. It requires consistently moist soil in spring, followed by drier conditions during its summer dormancy. A light application of compost or a balanced fertilizer in spring supports healthy growth, though it often thrives in naturally rich soil without heavy feeding.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in early spring is beneficial, but often not strictly necessary in naturally rich soil.
