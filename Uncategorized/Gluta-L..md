## Care Guide
Gluta thrives in conditions mirroring its native tropical rainforest habitat, necessitating high humidity and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide bright, indirect light and regular fertilization during active growth to support its development. Protect from direct sun and ensure proper drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer), typically every 2-4 weeks. Reduce or stop fertilization during cooler, inactive periods.
