## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (e.g., Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Wyoming) |
| **Climate** | Montane Semi-Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives best in open, exposed areas common in its native high-altitude habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow soil to dry out significantly between waterings, as it's adapted to distinct wet and dry periods characteristic of semi-arid montane regions. |

## Care Guide
Wright's Thelypody thrives in environments mimicking its native montane semi-arid scrublands. Provide full to partial sun exposure and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between applications. It generally requires low to moderate fertilization, reflecting its adaptable nature in diverse soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not a heavy feeder. A balanced, diluted fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season if soil nutrients are visibly lacking.
