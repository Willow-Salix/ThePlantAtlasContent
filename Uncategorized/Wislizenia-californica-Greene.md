## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. It is adapted to lean soils and does not typically need fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
