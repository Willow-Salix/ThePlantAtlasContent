## Introduction
Cleomella is a genus of flowering plants. It includes 22 species of native to North America, ranging from southern Mexico through the western and central United States to western and central Canada. Like their relatives, the cleomes, plants of this genus have traditionally been included in the caper family Capparaceae but have recently been moved into a new family, Cleomaceae. Cleomella are annual wildflowers native to the dry and desert regions of western North America. They are similar to cleomes in appearance.

## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. It is adapted to lean soils and does not typically need fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to lean, nutrient-poor desert soils. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
