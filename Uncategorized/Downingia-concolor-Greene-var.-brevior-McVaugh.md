| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (primarily California, USA) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Vernal Pool habitat) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright, direct light during its active growing season. |
| **Watering** | High during the growing season (winter to late spring), mimicking vernal pool inundation. Requires consistent moisture or even standing water. A dry dormancy period is essential during summer and fall. |

## Introduction
Downingia is a genus of 13 annual plants native to western North America and Chile. Commonly known as calico flowers, they are notable for forming mass displays of small but colorful blooms around vernal pools. A number are uncommon endemics in California.
The stems may be decumbent or erect, 10–40 cm in length, with narrow cauline leaves that may drop off before the flower develops. The flowers are typically inverted by the twisting of the ovary during blooming. Colors range from blue and pink to white, with the lower (larger) lip including a white or yellow patch. The lower lip generally consists of three lobes, while the upper lip is much smaller and has two lobes.
The genus is named after American horticulturalist A. J. Downing (1815-1852).

## Care Guide
To care for the Maroonspot Calicoflower, provide full sun and abundant water or bog-like conditions during its winter-spring active growth period. Mimic its native vernal pool habitat by allowing a complete dry dormancy in summer and fall. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum as it thrives in low-nutrient soils.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor soils found in vernal pool environments. Little to no fertilization is typically needed.
