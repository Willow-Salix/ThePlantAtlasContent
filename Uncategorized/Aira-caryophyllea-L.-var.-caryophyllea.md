## Introduction
Aira is a genus of Old World plants in the grass family, native to western and southern Europe, central and southwest Asia, plus Africa.
The common name, shared with the similar related genera Deschampsia and Koeleria, is hair-grass, from the very slender leaves and stems. The species typically occur on dry, sandy sites, and grow to 20–40 cm tall.
Several species are grown as ornamental plants for their very delicate airy seed heads, used in dried flower arrangements.

## Care Guide
Silver Hairgrass is an annual grass that flourishes in full sun and dry, well-draining, nutrient-poor soils. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering, and requires minimal to no fertilization to thrive.

### Fertilizer
Low to None; thrives in poor, nutrient-deficient soils and does not require regular fertilization.
