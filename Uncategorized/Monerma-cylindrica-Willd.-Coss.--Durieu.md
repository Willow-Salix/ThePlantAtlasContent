## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, adapting to the hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters of its native Mediterranean climate. It requires minimal watering once established and generally needs no fertilization, preferring lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and does not typically require supplementary fertilization, reflecting its adaptation to less nutrient-rich environments.
