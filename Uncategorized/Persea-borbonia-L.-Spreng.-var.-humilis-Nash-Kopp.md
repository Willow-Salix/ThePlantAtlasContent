## Care Guide
Pondspice thrives in sunny locations with consistently moist, well-draining, acidic soil, mimicking its native Florida flatwoods habitat. It requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but is tolerant of some drought. Fertilization should be light, especially with acid-specific formulations.

### Fertilizer
Minimal, light fertilization with an acid-loving plant formula if soil is poor.
