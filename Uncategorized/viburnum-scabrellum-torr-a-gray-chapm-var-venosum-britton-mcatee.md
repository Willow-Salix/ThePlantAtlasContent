| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (specifically Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial shade for optimal growth and flowering, tolerating some shade but with potentially reduced bloom. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil. Water regularly, especially during dry periods and its establishment phase, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Viburnum dentatum, southern arrowwood or arrowwood viburnum or roughish arrowwood, is a small shrub, native to the eastern United States and Canada from Maine south to northern Florida and eastern Texas.
Like most Viburnum, it has opposite, simple leaves and fruit in berry-like drupes. Foliage turns yellow to red in late fall.  Localized variations of the species are common over its entire geographic range.  Common differences include leaf size and shape and placement of pubescence on leaf undersides and petioles.
V. dentatum occurs in habitat types such as upland mixed woodlands, mesic pine-oak woods, hardwood hammocks, and floodplains.

Some moth larvae feed on V. dentatum. Known such species include the unsated sallow (or arrowwood sallow; Metaxaglaea inulta) and Phyllonorycter viburnella. It is also consumed by the viburnum leaf beetle (Pyrrhalta viburni), an invasive species from Eurasia. The fruits are a food source for songbirds. Berries contain 41.3% fat.
The fruits appear blue. The major pigments are cyanidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 3-sambubioside, and cyanidin 3-vicianoside, but the total mixture is very complex.
Native Americans used the young stems to make arrow shafts.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This shrub thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native temperate woodland habitat. Provide regular watering during dry spells and a light annual fertilization for best health and flowering. It is a relatively low-maintenance plant once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from an annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, or enrichment of the soil with organic compost. Generally not a heavy feeder.
