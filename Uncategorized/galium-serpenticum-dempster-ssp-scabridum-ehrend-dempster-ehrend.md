| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Intermountain West region (e.g., California, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Montana) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to semi-arid Montane or Subalpine Scrubland/Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring brighter conditions consistent with open woodlands and scrublands. |

## 🌱 Overview
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, Intermountain Bedstraw requires ample sunlight and well-draining soil, reflecting its native dry, open mountain and scrubland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering, and thrives with minimal to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to naturally nutrient-poor mountain soils. Minimal or no fertilization is generally needed; a very light, balanced application in spring is sufficient if desired.
