*Gouldia affinis (DC.) Wilbur* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaii, USA |
| **Climate** | Tropical Mesic Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade, mimicking its natural understory or dappled sunlight environment in Hawaiian forests. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but well-draining; allow the top inch or two to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native thrives in conditions simulating its tropical mesic forest home. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but never waterlogged. Fertilize moderately during warmer months to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength, every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
