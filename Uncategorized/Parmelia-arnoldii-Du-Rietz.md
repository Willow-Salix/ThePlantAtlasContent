| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests, Boreal Forests. Thrives in areas with good air quality and consistent atmospheric moisture. |
| **☀️ Light** | Filtered light to partial shade, consistent with its growth on tree bark under a canopy. Avoid direct, intense sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | High ambient humidity and regular exposure to moisture from rain or dew are crucial. It does not require 'watering' in the traditional sense, but needs periodic rehydration from atmospheric moisture. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen requires high ambient humidity and filtered light, simulating its native forest canopy environment. It obtains all necessary moisture and nutrients from the air and precipitation, meaning traditional watering and fertilization are unnecessary and harmful. Ensure clean air and protection from direct sun.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens absorb nutrients from the air and rainwater; traditional fertilizers are detrimental to their health.
