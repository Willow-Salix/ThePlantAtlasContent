## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (where its primary parent species are native and hybrids were developed) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical to Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and fruit production, similar to its wild relatives growing in forest edges and clearings. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; needs consistent moisture, especially during dry periods and fruit development, reflecting the moderate to high rainfall of its native regions. Well-draining soil is essential to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Vitis (grapevine) is a genus of 81 accepted species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae.  The genus consists of species predominantly from the Northern Hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture.
Most cultivated Vitis varieties are wind-pollinated with hermaphroditic flowers containing both male and female reproductive structures, while wild species are dioecious. These flowers are grouped in bunches called inflorescences. In many species, such as Vitis vinifera, each successfully pollinated flower becomes a grape berry with the inflorescence turning into a cluster of grapes. While the flowers of the grapevines are usually very small, the berries are often large and brightly colored with sweet flavors that attract birds and other animals to disperse the seeds contained within the berries.
Grapevines usually only produce fruit on shoots that came from buds that were developed during the previous growing season. In viticulture, this is one of the principles behind pruning the previous year's growth (or "One year old wood") that includes shoots that have turned hard and woody during the winter (after harvest in commercial viticulture). These vines will be pruned either into a cane which will support 8 to 15 buds or to a smaller spur which holds 2 to 3 buds.

## Care Guide
The Bourquin Hybrid Grape thrives in full to partial sun, needing ample light for fruiting. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from regular fertilization during its growing season. Provide sturdy support for its climbing vines.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to heavy; benefits from regular balanced fertilization during the active growing season (spring and early summer) to support vigorous vine growth and fruit production, as grapes are relatively heavy feeders.
