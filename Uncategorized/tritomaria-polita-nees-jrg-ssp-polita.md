## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort thrives in cool, consistently moist, and highly humid environments with low to moderate indirect light. Ensure the substrate is always damp, and provide excellent air circulation to prevent mold while maintaining high humidity. Minimal fertilization is required, as it prefers nutrient-poor, calcareous conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Minimal fertilization, if any, is needed. Liverworts are not heavy feeders and prefer nutrient-poor, calcareous substrates.
