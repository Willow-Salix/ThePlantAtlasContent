| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forest (specifically forest margins, clearings, and coastal scrub within these biomes) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for optimal flowering, mimicking its behavior of climbing to reach light in its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, especially during dry periods and active growth, to maintain consistently moist but well-drained soil, reflective of its native habitat's regular rainfall. |

## Introduction
Ipomoea indica is a species of flowering plant in the family Convolvulaceae, known by several common names, including blue morning glory, oceanblue morning glory, koali awa, and blue dawn flower. It bears heart-shaped or three-lobed leaves and purple or blue funnel-shaped flowers 6–8 cm (2–3 in) in diameter, from spring to autumn. The flowers produced by the plant are hermaphroditic. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
The plant is grown as an ornamental for its attractive flowers, but is considered invasive in many regions of the world, being specifically listed on New Zealand's Biosecurity Act 1993.
