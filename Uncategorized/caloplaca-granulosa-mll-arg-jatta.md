## 🌱 Overview
Caloplaca is a lichen genus comprising a number of distinct species. Members of the genus are commonly called firedot lichen, jewel lichen. gold lichens, "orange lichens", but they are not always orange, as in the case of C. albovariegata. The distribution of this lichen genus is worldwide, extending from Antarctica to the high Arctic. It includes a portion of northern North America and the Russian High Arctic. There are about thirty species of Caloplaca in the flora of the British Isles.
A new species of Caloplaca, C. obamae, the first species to be named in honor of Barack Obama, was discovered in 2007 on Santa Rosa Island in California and published in March 2009.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The granulose orange lichen thrives in bright, direct light and requires very minimal moisture, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. It obtains all necessary nutrients from its environment, making fertilization unnecessary. Providing a suitable, exposed rocky substrate is key to its care.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens are self-sufficient, obtaining nutrients from the air, rain, and the minerals in their substrate; conventional fertilization can be harmful.
