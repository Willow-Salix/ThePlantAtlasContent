## Care Guide
This tropical plant thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light. Maintain consistent soil moisture during active growth, allowing slight drying between waterings, and fertilize regularly. Reduce water and stop fertilizer during cooler, dormant periods.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Reduce or cease fertilization during dormancy.
