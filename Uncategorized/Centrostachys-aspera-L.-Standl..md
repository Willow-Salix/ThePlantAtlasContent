## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring moderate watering with occasional dry spells. It is not particularly demanding in terms of soil fertility, making it a low-maintenance choice that tolerates a range of conditions common in its native tropical and subtropical habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a hardy plant often found in disturbed or less fertile soils, it does not require heavy fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
