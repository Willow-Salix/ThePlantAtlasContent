## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia (coastal New South Wales and southern Queensland) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Warm Temperate Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent and abundant watering; soil should remain constantly moist to wet, as it tolerates waterlogged conditions and is not drought-tolerant. |

## Introduction
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## Care Guide
The Swamp Mahogany thrives in full sun to partial sun, needing consistently moist to wet soil conditions, indicative of its native wetland habitat. It tolerates waterlogging well but should not experience drought, and benefits from low to moderate, sparingly applied balanced fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly, especially for young plants, but avoid high phosphorus formulations.
