## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Pacific Northwest, Alaska), Northern Europe |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Coniferous Forest / Temperate Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to partial sun; prefers filtered light or shade, avoiding direct, intense sun that can cause desiccation. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and frequent moisture from misting or atmospheric water vapor; never allowed to completely dry out, mimicking its consistently damp forest habitat. |

## Introduction
Bryoria is a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. Many members of this genus are known as horsehair lichens. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in boreal and cool temperate areas. These lichens typically grow as slender, hair-like strands that hang from conifer trees or form small bushes, ranging in colour from dark brown to pale grey. They play important ecological roles, particularly as winter food for caribou in northern forests, where some species can accumulate in large quantities in the forest canopy. The genus contains about 35 species found worldwide, with ongoing discoveries of new species especially in mountainous regions of Asia and western North America.

## Care Guide
To care for Horsehair Lichen, replicate its cool, humid, and shaded forest environment. Ensure consistent moisture through high ambient humidity and regular misting, avoiding direct sun. Traditional fertilizers are detrimental, as lichens absorb all necessary nutrients from their environment.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; traditional fertilizers are harmful to lichens, which derive nutrients from air, dust, and precipitation.
