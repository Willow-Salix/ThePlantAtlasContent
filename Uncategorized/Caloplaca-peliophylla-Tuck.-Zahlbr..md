## Introduction
Caloplaca is a lichen genus comprising a number of distinct species. Members of the genus are commonly called firedot lichen, jewel lichen. gold lichens, "orange lichens", but they are not always orange, as in the case of C. albovariegata. The distribution of this lichen genus is worldwide, extending from Antarctica to the high Arctic. It includes a portion of northern North America and the Russian High Arctic. There are about thirty species of Caloplaca in the flora of the British Isles.
A new species of Caloplaca, C. obamae, the first species to be named in honor of Barack Obama, was discovered in 2007 on Santa Rosa Island in California and published in March 2009.

## Care Guide
As a lichen, Caloplaca peliophylla does not require traditional plant care like watering or fertilizing. It thrives in full sun conditions, absorbing all necessary moisture and nutrients directly from the ambient atmosphere and occasional rainfall. Maintaining good air quality and avoiding disturbance are crucial for its survival.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain nutrients from the atmosphere and substrate; artificial fertilizers are detrimental and can cause harm.
