| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States, parts of Mexico, and the Caribbean |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Wetland / Marshland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, as it naturally occurs in open, exposed wet areas. |
| **Watering** | Constantly wet soil conditions are essential, ideally with shallow standing water, mirroring its wetland habitat. It is a semi-aquatic plant. |

## Introduction
Schoenoplectus (club-rush [Old World species], bulrush or tule [New World species]) is a genus of plants in the sedge family with a cosmopolitan distribution. Note that the name bulrush is also applied to species in the unrelated genus Typha as well as to other sedges. The genus Schoenoplectus was formerly considered part of Scirpus, but recent phylogenetic data shows that they are not closely related.

## Care Guide
Erect Bulrush thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently saturated soil, ideally with shallow standing water. Ensure its root system remains submerged or in very wet conditions to mimic its natural wetland environment. Moderate fertilization can support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. It can thrive in nutrient-rich wetland muck; a balanced aquatic plant fertilizer or slow-release granular formulation can be beneficial, but heavy feeding is generally not required.
