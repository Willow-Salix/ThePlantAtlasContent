## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern Africa (e.g., Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea), Arabian Peninsula (e.g., Oman, Yemen), and India. |
| **Climate** | Arid to semi-arid tropical and subtropical scrubland and dry deciduous forests, often on rocky slopes. |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun to bright indirect light, mimicking its natural exposure in open, arid landscapes. |
| **Watering** | Water sparingly and infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly susceptible to root rot from overwatering, especially during dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Boswellia is a genus of trees in the family Burseraceae, known for its fragrant resin. The biblical incense frankincense is an extract from the resin of the tree Boswellia sacra, and is now produced also from B. frereana. Boswellia species are moderate-sized flowering plants, including both trees and shrubs.

## Care Guide
Boswellia thrives in conditions mimicking its arid native environment. Provide ample sunlight, water sparingly only when the soil is completely dry, and use well-draining, lean soil. Avoid overwatering at all costs to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs due to its native habitat of nutrient-poor soils. A diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season, but is not frequently required.
