| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (from British Columbia south through the western United States into Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate zones, often thriving in disturbed and open habitats such as agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, consistent with its native habitat in exposed, open environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. While somewhat drought-tolerant once established, it thrives with consistent moisture during its active growing season. |

## 🌱 Overview
Amaranthus powellii is a species of amaranth known by the common names Powell's amaranth and green amaranth.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Powell's amaranth is a robust annual that thrives in full sun and average, well-draining soil. Provide moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and light fertilization for optimal growth, mirroring its preference for open, moderately fertile environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. It can grow in average soils but benefits from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during its active growth, especially in nutrient-poor conditions.
