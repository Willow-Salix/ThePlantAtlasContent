## Introduction
Calandrinia is a genus of flowering plants known as purslanes and redmaids. It includes 37 species of annual and perennial herbs which bear colorful flowers in shades of red to purple and white. Species of this genus are native to the Americas, including western and southern South America, Central America, and western North America. Some species have been introduced to parts of Australia, New Zealand, southern Africa, Asia, and Europe. Over 60 species native to Australia and New Guinea that were formerly included in Calandrinia are now placed in a separate genus, Rumicastrum or Parakeelya. A single eastern Australian species named in 2022, Calandrinia petrophila, is still included in Calandrinia, but will be placed into the Australian genus when the name of the new genus is finally settled.

## Care Guide
Tweedy's Calandrinia thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native semi-arid environment. It is drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and has low fertilizer needs. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low; a light, balanced fertilizer once annually in spring is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich soil.
