## Care Guide
This native grass prefers the humid subtropical conditions of the southeastern US, thriving in both full sun and partial shade. It requires consistently moist soil, especially while growing, but can endure brief dry spells. Fertilization needs are minimal, typically only a light spring application in less fertile soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is sufficient if soil nutrients are poor.
