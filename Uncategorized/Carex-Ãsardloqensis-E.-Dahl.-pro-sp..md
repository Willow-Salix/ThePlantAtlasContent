## Introduction
The Cyperaceae () are a family of  graminoid (grass-like), monocotyledonous flowering plants known as sedges. The family is large; botanists have described some 5,500 known species in about 90 genera – the largest being the "true sedges" (genus Carex), with over 2,000 species.

## Care Guide
This arctic hybrid sedge thrives in cool, wet environments, requiring consistently saturated or boggy soil and full sun during its brief growing season. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor tundra, minimal fertilization is needed for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low; native tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor. Fertilize sparingly with a very dilute solution, if at all.
