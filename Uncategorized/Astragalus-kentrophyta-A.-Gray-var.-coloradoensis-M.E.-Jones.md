## Care Guide
This Colorado native thrives in conditions mimicking its arid shrubland habitat, requiring abundant sunlight and very little water. It prefers lean, well-draining soils and generally does not need fertilizer, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils and is a legume (nitrogen-fixing). Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
