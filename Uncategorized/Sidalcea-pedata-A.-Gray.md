## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (Sierra Nevada foothills, southern Coast Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Chaparral, Foothill Woodland) |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Moderate during the active growing season (winter/spring), becoming drought-tolerant once established; requires less water in summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## Care Guide
Birdfoot Checkerbloom thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean habitat. Water moderately during its active growth period, allowing soil to dry between waterings, and minimize water in summer as it is highly drought-tolerant. Fertilization is rarely needed for this hardy perennial.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically unnecessary in moderately fertile soil. If growth is poor, a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial.
