## Introduction
Camissonia campestris (field primrose, Mojave sun cup, or Mojave suncup), is a flowering plant in the family Onagraceae, native to the Mojave Desert of the United States. It grows mostly on open, sandy flats, occurring from sea level to 2,000 m in the western and central part of the desert.
It is an annual plant growing to 5–25 cm tall (rarely to 50 cm tall). The leaves are linear, 0.5–3 cm long, with a finely serrated margin. The flowers have four petals 5–15 mm long, yellow with a red spot at the base, fading orange to reddish.

## Care Guide
The Mojave Suncup thrives in conditions mirroring its desert home, needing full sun and very well-draining soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between sessions, and avoid rich fertilization. This plant is drought-tolerant and sensitive to excessive moisture.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required; thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or gravelly soils common in its native arid environment.
