## Introduction
Honeysuckles are arching shrubs or twining vines in the genus Lonicera () of the family Caprifoliaceae. The genus includes 158 species native to northern latitudes in North America, Eurasia, and North Africa. Widely known species include Lonicera periclymenum (common honeysuckle or woodbine), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle, white honeysuckle, or Chinese honeysuckle) and Lonicera sempervirens (coral honeysuckle, trumpet honeysuckle, or woodbine honeysuckle). L. japonica is a highly invasive species considered a significant pest in parts of North America, Europe, South America, New Zealand, Australia, and Africa.
Some species are highly fragrant and colorful, so are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. In North America, hummingbirds are attracted to the flowers, especially L. sempervirens and L. ciliosa (orange honeysuckle). Honeysuckle derives its name from the edible sweet nectar obtainable from its tubular flowers. The name Lonicera stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist.

## Care Guide
California Honeysuckle is adaptable, thriving in full sun to partial shade and a variety of soil types. It requires moderate watering, especially when young or during dry spells, but exhibits good drought tolerance once established. Fertilization is generally minimal, as it is not a heavy feeder.

### Fertilizer
Low. Generally not a heavy feeder. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary.
