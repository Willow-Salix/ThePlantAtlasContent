## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (from Newfoundland west to Wisconsin, and south to Florida and Louisiana) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade; prefers dappled sunlight or deep shade as it grows on the forest floor under a canopy. Direct sun can scorch fronds. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil; requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, mimicking the moist conditions of a forest floor. Good drainage is essential to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
The moth genus Dryopteris is now considered a junior synonym of Oreta.

Dryopteris , commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to Dryopteris filix-mas), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales.
Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American Dryopteris hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization.
The fossil record of this genus shows that it was widespread even as far back as the Cretaceous with fossils being found in Late Cretaceous rock layers from North America down to Antarctica.

## Care Guide
To care for the Intermediate Wood Fern, provide a moist, shady environment that mimics its native temperate forest floor habitat. Ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained and enrich it with organic matter, avoiding direct sunlight. Fertilize sparingly in spring to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from rich organic matter in the soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is sufficient.
