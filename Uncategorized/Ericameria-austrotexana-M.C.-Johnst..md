## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South Texas, USA |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Subtropical Dry Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires direct, intense sunlight for optimal growth, similar to its open desert and scrubland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low; this plant is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to infrequent rainfall. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to completely dry out between waterings. |

## Introduction
Ericameria is a genus of North American shrubs in the family Asteraceae.
Ericameria is known by the common names goldenbush, rabbitbrush, turpentine bush, and rabbitbush. Most are shrubs, but one species (E. parishii) can reach tree stature. They are distributed in western Canada (Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia) western United States (from the western Great Plains to the Pacific) and northern Mexico. Bright yellow flower heads adorn the plants in late summer. All the species have disc florets, while some have ray florets but others do not. Ericameria nauseosa, (synonym Chrysothamnus nauseosus), is known for its production of latex.

## Care Guide
This resilient shrub is ideally suited for full sun and dry conditions, mirroring its native South Texas arid scrubland. It requires minimal watering, tolerates lean soils, and thrives on neglect, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or low-maintenance landscapes in appropriate climates.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean, well-draining soils characteristic of arid regions and generally does not require supplemental fertilization. Over-fertilizing can be harmful.
