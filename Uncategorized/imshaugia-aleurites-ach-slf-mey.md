## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America, Europe, and Asia, particularly widespread in temperate and boreal forest regions. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate and Boreal Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Moderate to bright indirect light. As an epiphytic lichen found on tree bark and rocks in forests, it thrives in dappled shade or filtered light, avoiding prolonged direct, intense sunlight that can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High atmospheric humidity is critical, as lichens absorb moisture directly from the air, rain, and dew. Regular misting or placement in a consistently humid environment is necessary; traditional watering methods for soil are not applicable. Allow periods of drying between hydration to prevent rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Imshaugia is a genus of seven species of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. They are commonly known as starburst lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Imshaugia Lichen requires a cool, highly humid environment with moderate, indirect light, replicating its temperate and boreal forest origins. It obtains all its moisture and nutrients from the air and rainfall, so regular misting is vital, and no conventional fertilization should be applied.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization is required or recommended. Lichens acquire all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust, air) and leachates from their substrate. Chemical fertilizers can be detrimental to their delicate structure.
