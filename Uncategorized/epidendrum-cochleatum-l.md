## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Florida (USA), Mexico, Central America, the West Indies, and northern South America (including Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forests, often in areas with distinct wet and dry seasons. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light is ideal, mimicking its natural habitat in tree canopies or on rocks. It can tolerate some direct morning sun but should be protected from harsh midday or afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Water thoroughly when the growing medium is nearly dry to the touch. Allow for good drainage and a slight drying period between waterings, especially during cooler or less active periods. During the active growing season (wet season), water more frequently. |

## 🌱 Overview
Epidendrum , abbreviated Epi in the horticultural trade, is a large neotropical genus of the orchid family. With more than 1,500 species,  some authors describe it as a mega-genus. The genus name (from Greek επί, epi and δένδρον, dendron, "upon trees") refers to its epiphytic growth habit.
When Carl Linnaeus named this genus in 1763, he included in this genus all the epiphytic orchids known to him. Although few of these orchids are still included in the genus Epidendrum, some species of Epidendrum are nevertheless not epiphytic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Clamshell Orchid thrives in conditions similar to its native tropical forests, requiring bright indirect light and good air circulation. Provide consistent moisture during active growth, allowing the medium to approach dryness between waterings, and fertilize sparingly. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As an epiphyte, it derives nutrients from rainfall and decaying organic matter. Fertilize with a balanced orchid fertilizer, diluted to half or quarter strength, every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Reduce or cease fertilization during dormancy.
