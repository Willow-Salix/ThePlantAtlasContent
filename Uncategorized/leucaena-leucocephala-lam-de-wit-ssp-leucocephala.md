## 🧤 Care Instructions
The White Leadtree thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering, allowing for dry periods between applications, reflecting its tropical dry forest origin. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally needs low fertilizer, especially nitrogen, making it adaptable to less fertile soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it often thrives in poor soils and may not require additional nitrogen. A balanced fertilizer or one higher in phosphorus and potassium can be applied sparingly if growth is slow.
