## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its subtropical Florida origins. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and benefits from minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to lean native soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer during the growing season, especially in poor soils, as its native habitats often have lean, sandy soils.
