| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (endemic) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Coastal Xeric Shrubland / Coastal Scrub |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure, reflecting its open, sea cliff habitat where it receives direct, unobstructed sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to low water; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is adapted to well-drained, potentially dry coastal conditions and can tolerate some drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bidens is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. The genus include roughly 230 species which are distributed worldwide. Despite their global distribution, the systematics and taxonomy of the genus has been described as complicated and unorganized. The common names beggarticks, black jack, burr marigolds, cobbler's pegs, Spanish needles, stickseeds, tickseeds and tickseed sunflowers refer to the fruits of the plants, most of which are bristly and barbed. The generic name refers to the same character; Bidens comes from the Latin bi ("two") and dens ("tooth").

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in full sun, reflecting its native sea cliff habitat. It prefers well-draining soil and is moderately drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established. Minimal fertilization is sufficient to maintain its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; use a diluted, balanced fertilizer sparingly during the growing season, as it is adapted to less fertile native soils found on cliffs.
