## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate, boreal, and montane regions globally, including Europe, North America, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Cool-Temperate to Alpine/Subalpine, typically found in humid environments with calcareous rocks. |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate, indirect light. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can cause rapid desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist, never allowing the substrate or plant to dry out completely. Prefers high humidity and frequent watering or misting, mimicking its natural seepage habitat. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, humid conditions with consistent moisture and low to moderate indirect light. It requires minimal nutrients and prefers calcareous substrates. Mimic its natural habitat of moist rock faces in shady, temperate environments to ensure success.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Mosses have very low nutrient demands; if desired, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (1/10th strength) can be applied very infrequently.
