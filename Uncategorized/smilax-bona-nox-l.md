## 🌱 Overview
Smilax is a genus of about 300–350 species, found in the tropics and subtropics worldwide. They are climbing flowering plants, many of which are woody and/or thorny, in the monocotyledon family Smilacaceae, native throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. 
Common names include catbriers, greenbriers, prickly-ivys and smilaxes. Sarsaparilla (also zarzaparrilla, sarsparilla) is a name used specifically for the Neotropical S. ornata as well as a catch-all term in particular for American species. Occasionally, the non-woody species such as the smooth herbaceous greenbrier (S. herbacea) are separated as genus Nemexia; they are commonly known by the rather ambiguous name carrion flowers.
Greenbriers get their scientific name from the Greek myth of Crocus and the nymph Smilax. Though this myth has numerous forms, it always centers around the unfulfilled and tragic love of a mortal man who is turned into a flower, and a woodland nymph who is transformed into a brambly vine.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient vine thrives in humid subtropical conditions, tolerating varied light from full sun to partial shade. Provide moderate watering, letting the soil dry out between sessions, and minimal fertilization as it is highly adaptable to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; rarely requires fertilization, or a light, balanced feed once a year in spring.
