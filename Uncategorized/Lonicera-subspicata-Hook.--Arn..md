## Introduction
Honeysuckles are arching shrubs or twining vines in the genus Lonicera () of the family Caprifoliaceae. The genus includes 158 species native to northern latitudes in North America, Eurasia, and North Africa. Widely known species include Lonicera periclymenum (common honeysuckle or woodbine), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle, white honeysuckle, or Chinese honeysuckle) and Lonicera sempervirens (coral honeysuckle, trumpet honeysuckle, or woodbine honeysuckle). L. japonica is a highly invasive species considered a significant pest in parts of North America, Europe, South America, New Zealand, Australia, and Africa.
Some species are highly fragrant and colorful, so are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. In North America, hummingbirds are attracted to the flowers, especially L. sempervirens and L. ciliosa (orange honeysuckle). Honeysuckle derives its name from the edible sweet nectar obtainable from its tubular flowers. The name Lonicera stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist.

## Care Guide
Southern Honeysuckle, native to the Mediterranean climate of California and Baja California, thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing infrequent deep watering during dry spells. Fertilizer needs are low, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant suitable for dry, sunny gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally does not require heavy feeding. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient if soil is poor, otherwise minimal or none.
