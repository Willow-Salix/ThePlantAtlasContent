## Introduction
Ipomoea () is the largest genus in the plant family Convolvulaceae, with over 600 species. It is a large and diverse group, with common names including morning glory, water convolvulus or water spinach, sweet potato, bindweed, moonflower, etc. The genus occurs throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and comprises annual and perennial herbaceous plants, lianas, shrubs, and small trees; most of the species are twining climbing plants.
Their most widespread common name is morning glory, but some species in related genera bear that same common name and some Ipomoea species are known by different common names. Those formerly separated in Calonyction (Greek καλός kalós "good" and νύξ, νυκτός núx, nuktós, "night") are called moonflowers. The name Ipomoea is derived from the Ancient Greek ἴψ, meaning 'woodworm', and ὅμοιος (hómoios), meaning "resembling". It refers to their twining habit.

## Care Guide
This resilient temperate vine thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and requires minimal fertilization once established. Its deep tuber makes it quite drought-tolerant and adaptable to various conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from a light application of balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once or twice during the growing season, especially in poor soils. Avoid excessive nitrogen.
