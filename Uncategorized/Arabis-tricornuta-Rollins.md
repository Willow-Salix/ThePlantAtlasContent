## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant rockcress thrives in full sun and exceptionally well-draining, lean soil, mimicking its native semi-arid montane habitat. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry, and avoid rich fertilizers to prevent over-nutrition.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in lean, well-draining, rocky soils. Minimal to no fertilization is needed; excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
