## Introduction
Splachnum, also known as dung moss or petticoat moss, is a genus of moss that is well known for its entomophily. It commonly grows on patches of dung or decomposing animal matter.

## Care Guide
Splachnum ovatum thrives in cool, highly moist environments with partial to full shade. It requires a constantly wet substrate and high humidity, mirroring its native boggy or tundra habitats. Providing a slow, steady supply of nutrients from organic sources will support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Benefits from nutrient-rich organic matter (e.g., decayed dung or similar slow-release organic fertilizers) to mimic its natural substrate.
