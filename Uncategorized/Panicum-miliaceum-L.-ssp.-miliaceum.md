| **Native Origin** | Central Asia, particularly the steppe regions spanning from Eastern Europe to China |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Semi-Arid Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its origin in open, treeless grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water moderately and allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, reflecting its adaptation to semi-arid regions with intermittent rainfall. |

## Care Guide
Broomcorn millet is a resilient, drought-tolerant grain originating from the open steppes of Central Asia. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established and tolerating low to moderate soil fertility. This makes it a low-maintenance plant suitable for a range of conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility; thrives in well-drained, average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization, consistent with plants growing on marginal lands.
