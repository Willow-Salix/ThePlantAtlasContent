## 🌱 Overview
Pseudoplatystoma is a genus of several South American catfish species of family Pimelodidae. The species are known by a number of different common names. They typically inhabit major rivers where they prefer the main channels and tend to stay at maximum depth, but some species can also be seen in lakes, flooded forests, and other freshwater habitats. They have robust bodies, and are important food fish. Recently, their population size has been on the drastic decline due to a variety of factors including overfishing and habitat destruction due to the construction of hydroelectric dams.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Doncella thrives in tropical and subtropical conditions with abundant sunlight and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular watering during its active growth period is crucial, and a balanced fertilizer can support its development. Protect from frost and ensure good air circulation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Established plants may not need heavy feeding if soil is naturally fertile.
