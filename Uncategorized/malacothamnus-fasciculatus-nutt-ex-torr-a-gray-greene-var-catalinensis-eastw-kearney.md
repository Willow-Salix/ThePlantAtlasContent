## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Santa Catalina Island, California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (Coastal Sage Scrub / Chaparral) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in summer. More frequent watering during the cooler growing season may be beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Malacothamnus (bushmallow) is a genus of shrubs found throughout much of mainland California and on three of the Channel Islands. Outside of California, Malacothamnus is known from the northern half of Baja California and from a few disjunct locations in Arizona and Nevada. Plants of this genus are most commonly found in early-successional, post-burn plant communities. Malacothamnus are currently thought to be most closely related to the Iliamnas of the US interior and the Phymosias of Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This bush mallow thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean climate on Santa Catalina Island. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overwatering to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Typically thrives in poorer soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial but is often not necessary.
