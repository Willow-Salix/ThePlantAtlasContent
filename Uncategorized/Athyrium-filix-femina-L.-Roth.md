## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (Cool, Moist Woodlands, Bogs, Streambanks) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade, thriving in dappled light or indirect exposure, as it typically grows under a tree canopy or in sheltered locations. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking the damp conditions of its native woodland floor or wetland habitats. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely. Benefits from high humidity. |

## Introduction
Athyrium (lady-fern) is a genus of about 180 species of terrestrial ferns, with a cosmopolitan distribution.  It is placed in the family Athyriaceae, in the order Polypodiales.
Its genus name is from Greek a- ('without') and Latinized Greek thyreos ('shield'), describing its inconspicuous indusium (sorus' covering).
The common name "lady fern" refers in particular to the common lady fern, Athyrium filix-femina.
Athyrium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the small angle shades and Sthenopis auratus.

## Care Guide
The Common Ladyfern flourishes in cool, moist, and shaded environments, replicating its native temperate forest habitat. Ensure the soil remains consistently damp and provide high humidity to support its delicate fronds. Fertilize sparingly during the growing season to maintain its vigor.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer or organic compost during the active growing season (spring and early summer). Its native soils are often rich in organic matter from leaf litter.
