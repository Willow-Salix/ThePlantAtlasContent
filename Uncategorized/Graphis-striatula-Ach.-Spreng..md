## Care Guide
Script Lichen thrives in conditions mirroring its native tropical rainforest, necessitating high humidity and indirect light. Consistent moisture through regular misting is vital, paired with good air circulation. Fertilization is generally unnecessary or should be very infrequent and highly diluted.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Lichens absorb nutrients from the air and rainwater. If cultivated, an extremely diluted (e.g., 1/10th strength) balanced liquid fertilizer can be very sparingly applied once or twice a year.
