## Care Guide
California Indian Paintbrush thrives in the full to partial sun conditions of its native Mediterranean climate. It prefers well-draining soil and requires moderate to low watering, adapted to dry summers. Minimal to no fertilization is needed due to its hemi-parasitic nature.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Rich soil can sometimes be detrimental. As a hemi-parasite, it acquires nutrients from host plants.
