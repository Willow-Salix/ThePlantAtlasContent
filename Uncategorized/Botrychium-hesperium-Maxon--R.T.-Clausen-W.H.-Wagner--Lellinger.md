## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including mountainous regions of the United States (e.g., Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, California, Colorado, Utah) and Canada (e.g., British Columbia, Alberta) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subalpine Moist Meadows and Open Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to bright indirect light; it thrives in dappled sunlight or filtered light conditions found in forest understories or open clearings, avoiding harsh direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil; regular watering is essential to mimic the moist meadow and forest floor conditions, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Botrychium is a genus of ferns, seedless vascular plants in the family Ophioglossaceae. Botrychium species are known as moonworts. They are small, with fleshy roots, and reproduce by spores shed into the air. One part of the leaf, the trophophore, is sterile and fernlike; the other, the sporophore, is fertile and carries the clusters of sporangia or spore cases.  Some species only occasionally emerge above ground and gain most of their nourishment from an association with mycorrhizal fungi.

## Care Guide
The western moonwort thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate to subalpine moist meadows and open woodlands. Provide bright indirect to partial shade and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but not waterlogged. Fertilize lightly during its active growth period to support its modest nutrient requirements.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer); it generally has low to moderate nutrient needs.
