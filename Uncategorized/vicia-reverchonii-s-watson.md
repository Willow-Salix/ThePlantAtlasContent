## 🧤 Care Instructions
Reverchon's Vetch thrives in full sun, typical of its native semi-arid grasslands, and is drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering. Due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities, it has low fertilizer requirements, making it a low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally enriches the soil and has minimal external fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be beneficial in very poor soils.
