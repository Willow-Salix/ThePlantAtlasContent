## Care Guide
American Bittercress requires consistently moist to wet soil and thrives in partial to full shade, mirroring its native woodland and stream-side habitats. Ensure rich, organic soil and protect it from drying out or intense sun exposure to maintain vigorous growth. Light fertilization is adequate.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It thrives in rich, organic soils. An annual top-dressing of compost or a diluted balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season is sufficient.
