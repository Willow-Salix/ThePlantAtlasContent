## Care Guide
Addison's Rosette Grass thrives in temperate woodland and pine barren conditions, requiring full sun to partial shade and excellent soil drainage. It prefers moderate, consistent moisture but can tolerate dry spells, and has very low fertilizer needs due to its adaptation to sandy, less fertile soils.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Minimal to no fertilization is typically required, as excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
