## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in its native arid scrubland and chaparral, Acacia rigidula requires full sun and infrequent watering, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Avoid over-fertilization, preferring lean, well-draining soils that mimic its natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; adapted to nutrient-poor soils. If growth is desired, a very light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer once in spring.
