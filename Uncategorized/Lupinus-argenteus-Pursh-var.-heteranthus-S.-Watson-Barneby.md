## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Texas) |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland, Montane Grasslands, and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking sporadic rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
This Silver Lupine variety thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean to moderately fertile soils, reflecting its arid to semi-arid native climate. Once established, it is drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering. Minimal fertilization is necessary due to its natural nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Low; as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils and does not require additional nitrogen. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
