## 🧤 Care Instructions
Edward Palmer's Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its arid native habitat. It is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent deep watering once established. Avoid excessive fertilization, especially nitrogen, due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils.
