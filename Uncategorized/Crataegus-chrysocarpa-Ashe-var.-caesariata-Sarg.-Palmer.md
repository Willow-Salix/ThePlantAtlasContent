## Care Guide
This Hawthorn variety is native to temperate deciduous forests of Eastern and Central North America, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate, consistent moisture, particularly when young, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Overall, it is a hardy, relatively low-maintenance plant well-suited to average garden conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Native soils in temperate forests are typically fertile from decomposing organic matter, but Hawthorns are not heavy feeders. A balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial, especially in poorer soils.
