| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open habitat in pine flatwoods. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, ensuring well-draining soil; allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings, mimicking Florida's seasonal rains and sandy soils. |

## Introduction
Hypericum  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Hypericaceae (formerly considered a subfamily of Clusiaceae).  The genus has a nearly worldwide distribution, missing only from tropical lowlands, deserts and polar regions. Many Hypericum species are regarded as invasive species and noxious weeds.  All members of the genus may be referred to as St. John's wort, and some are known as goatweed. The white or pink flowered marsh St. John's worts of North America and eastern Asia are generally accepted as belonging to the separate genus Triadenum Raf.
Hypericum is unusual for a genus of its size because a worldwide taxonomic monograph was produced for it by Norman Robson (working at the Natural History Museum, London). Robson recognizes 36 sections within Hypericum.

## Care Guide
This Florida native thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils, typical of its pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. Provide regular water, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings, and fertilize lightly if needed to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer annually in spring, especially in nutrient-poor sandy soils typical of its native range.
