# Steere's Pylaisiella Moss

*Pylaisiella steerei Ando & Higuchi* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Japan, East Asia (montane and subalpine regions) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect bright light to partial shade, avoiding direct harsh sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Maintain consistent moisture in the substrate and provide high ambient humidity. Water frequently but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
Steere's pylaisiella moss requires a cool, humid environment with filtered light, similar to its native temperate montane forests. It thrives with consistent moisture and excellent drainage, while fertilizer should be minimal to non-existent.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low fertilizer needs. A very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly, once or twice a year, or avoided entirely.
