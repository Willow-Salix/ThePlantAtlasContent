## Introduction
Berberis (), commonly known as barberry, is a large genus of deciduous and evergreen shrubs from 1–5 m (3+1⁄2–16+1⁄2 ft) tall, found throughout temperate and subtropical regions of the world (apart from Australia). Species diversity is greatest in South America and Asia, but native species also appear in Europe, Africa and North America. 
The best-known Berberis species is the type species, B. vulgaris (European barberry), which is common in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and central Asia; it has also been widely introduced in North America. Additionally, B. aquifolium is the state flower of Oregon.

## Care Guide
The Wintergreen Barberry thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate montane forest, requiring full sun to partial shade and regular watering in well-drained soil. This robust shrub is generally low-maintenance, needing minimal fertilization once established and exhibiting good drought tolerance.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically not essential in average garden soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial in nutrient-poor soils.
