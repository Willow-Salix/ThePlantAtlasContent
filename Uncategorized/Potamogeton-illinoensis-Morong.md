## Introduction
Potamogeton is a genus of aquatic, mostly freshwater, plants of the family Potamogetonaceae. Most are known by the common name pondweed, although many unrelated plants may be called pondweed, such as Canadian pondweed (Elodea canadensis). The genus name means "river neighbor", originating from the Greek potamos (river) and geiton (neighbor).

## Care Guide
This aquatic plant requires constant submergence in freshwater environments such as ponds or slow-moving water bodies. It thrives in full to partial sun, needing ample light for photosynthesis. Ensure stable water levels and a suitable aquatic substrate to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
