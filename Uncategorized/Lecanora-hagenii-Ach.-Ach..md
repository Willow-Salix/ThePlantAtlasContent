## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia), also found in Australia and New Zealand. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland and Urban |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to bright indirect light, tolerates some direct morning sun. Avoid harsh, intense direct afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular atmospheric moisture from rain, fog, or dew. If grown indoors or in dry climates, frequent misting to provide high humidity is essential. Lichens absorb water directly from the air and surface; they do not have roots. |

## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
Hagen's rim lichen is adaptable, thriving in temperate climates with moderate to bright indirect light. It relies on atmospheric moisture for hydration, making high humidity or frequent misting crucial. This lichen does not require traditional fertilizers, instead needing good air quality and a stable, suitable substrate for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizers are required or beneficial. Optimal growth depends on good air quality and a stable, appropriate substrate (such as bark, rock, or wood) from which it absorbs trace nutrients.
