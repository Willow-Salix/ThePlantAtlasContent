| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Grasslands and Scrublands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. Requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, thriving in open, exposed environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Very low water needs once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bighead Gilia is a resilient plant perfectly suited for full sun and well-draining, lean soils. Mimicking its native arid climate, provide infrequent deep watering and avoid over-fertilization to ensure optimal growth and health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its native habitat, and can be harmed by excessive nutrients.
