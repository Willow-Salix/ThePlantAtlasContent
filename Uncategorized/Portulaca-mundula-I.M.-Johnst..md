## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, and southern Brazil |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands and Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to periods of aridity. |

## Introduction
Portulaca ( POR-chə-LAK-ə, UK also  POR-tyuul-AK-ə, US also  POR-chə-LAH-kə) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Portulacaceae, and is the type genus of the family. With over 100 species, it is found in the tropics and warm temperate regions. Portulacas are also known as the purslanes.
Common purslane (Portulaca oleracea) is widely consumed as an edible plant, and in some areas it is invasive. Portulaca grandiflora is a well-known ornamental garden plant. Purslanes are relished by chickens. Some Portulaca species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the nutmeg moth (Hadula trifolii).
Some Portulaca species can undergo photosynthesis using the C4 or the CAM light-independent pathway as required depending on environmental conditions.

## Care Guide
Portulaca mundula thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its semi-arid tropical native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established to prevent rot. Minimal fertilization is needed for optimal growth and abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It tolerates poor to average soils in its native range, so excessive fertilization is not needed and may reduce flowering. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient.
