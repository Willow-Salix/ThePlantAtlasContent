## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate and boreal forests across the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia) |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate and Boreal Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Filtered light to partial shade, protected from intense direct sun by a forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | Frequent atmospheric moisture (e.g., misting, high humidity, rainwater) with good air circulation to allow for drying between wetting cycles; never allow to sit in standing water. |

## Introduction
Hypogymnia is a genus of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. They are commonly known as tube lichens, bone lichens, or pillow lichens. Most species lack rhizines (root-like attachment organs on the lower surface) that are otherwise common in members of the Parmeliaceae, and have swollen lobes that are usually hollow. Other common characteristics are relatively small spores and the presence of physodic acid and related lichen products. The lichens usually grow on the bark and wood of coniferous trees.
Hypogymnia was proposed by lichenologist William Nylander, first as a subgenus of Parmelia in 1881, and 15 years later as a distinct genus of two species, including the widespread and common type species, Hypogymnia physodes. It has since grown to about 90 recognized species. Hypogymnia has a centre of biodiversity in China, where many of its species are found.

## Care Guide
Tube lichens thrive in cool, humid conditions with filtered light, typical of temperate and boreal forests. They require regular atmospheric moisture, such as misting or high humidity, but also good air circulation to dry out periodically. Traditional fertilization is not needed, as they derive nutrients from the air and rainwater.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required, as lichens absorb necessary nutrients from the air and atmospheric precipitation.
