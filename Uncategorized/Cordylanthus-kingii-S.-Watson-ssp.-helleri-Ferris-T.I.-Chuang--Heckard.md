## Introduction
Cordylanthus (lit. 'club-flower'), commonly known as bird's beaks, is a genus of parasitic plants in the broomrape family, Orobanchaceae. These western North American natives are sparse, weedy-looking annuals with long branching erect stems and little foliage, and many bear bird's-beak–shaped flowers. They are remarkable among the broomrapes for growing at searing temperatures in arid climates.

## Care Guide
This California native thrives in full sun and very dry conditions, requiring infrequent watering. Adapted to poor, often serpentine soils, it should not be heavily fertilized and is ideal for arid, low-nutrient garden spots.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant thrives in poor, nutrient-deficient soils, often serpentine, and does not require or tolerate rich soils or heavy fertilization.
