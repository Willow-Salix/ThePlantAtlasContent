## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arctic moss thrives in consistently wet, cool conditions with bright, indirect light. It requires minimal nutrients, preferring a constantly moist substrate and cooler temperatures to mimic its native tundra environment, never allowing it to dry out.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low nutrient requirements; minimal to no fertilization is needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor tundra environments.
