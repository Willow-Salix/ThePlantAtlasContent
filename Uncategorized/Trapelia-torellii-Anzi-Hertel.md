## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Cool temperate to arctic-alpine regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including mountains of Europe (e.g., Alps, Scandinavia), North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Pacific Northwest), and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Tundra, Montane regions on exposed siliceous rocks. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade on exposed rock faces in its native habitat. In cultivation, bright indirect light to partial shade is often safer to prevent desiccation while ensuring adequate moisture. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity or frequent misting. This lichen absorbs moisture directly from the air (fog, dew, rain) and rock surface; traditional soil-based watering is not applicable. It can tolerate periods of desiccation. |

## Introduction
Trapelia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Trapeliaceae. These lichens form tight, crusty patches on rocks and bark that may appear smooth at first but often crack into small plates over time. The genus was established by the French lichenologist Maurice Choisy in 1929 and contains more than 20 species found worldwide. Most species reproduce through small, disc-shaped fruiting bodies that range from pale pink-brown to nearly black, and many can be identified by specific chemical compounds they produce.

## Care Guide
Trapelia torellii is a saxicolous (rock-dwelling) lichen thriving in cool, moist alpine environments. It requires bright indirect to partial sun exposure, balanced with high ambient humidity to prevent desiccation. Avoid traditional watering and fertilization, focusing instead on consistent atmospheric moisture.

### Fertilizer
Not typically required. Obtains essential nutrients from the air (dust, dissolved minerals in rain) and the mineral substrate it grows on.
