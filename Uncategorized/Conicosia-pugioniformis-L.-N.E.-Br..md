## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South Africa (Cape Provinces) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Fynbos/Succulent Karoo biomes) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive and flower well. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly during cooler, dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Conicosia is a genus of succulent plants in the ice plant family native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa. They are known commonly as narrow-leafed ice plants. These are relatively short-lived perennials with underground stems and tentacle-shaped, dull-pointed triangular leaves. They bear large tubular flowers often exceeding 10 centimeters in width, with up to 250 fringelike petals arranged in a ring around a center with hundreds of stamens. The fruit is a capsule which opens when it gets wet, slowly releasing the hundreds of tiny seeds as they fall out of its drying flesh.
Two species are accepted.

Conicosia elongata (Haw.) Schwantes
Conicosia pugioniformis (L.) N.E.Br.

## Care Guide
This succulent thrives in conditions mimicking its native South African Mediterranean climate. Provide plenty of full sun and ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Water sparingly, only when the soil is completely dry, and fertilize very lightly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally does not require heavy fertilization. A diluted, balanced succulent fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season.
