## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico (Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6-8+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native desert exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant, reflecting its adaptation to low rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Tagetes () is a genus  of 50 species of annual or perennial, mostly herbaceous plants in the family Asteraceae. They are among several groups of plants known in English as marigolds. The genus Tagetes was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.
Originally called cempōhualxōchitl, by the Nahua people, these plants are native to Central and Southern Mexico and several other Latin American countries. Some species have become naturalized around the world. One species, T. minuta, is considered a noxious invasive plant in some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Palmer's Marigold is a resilient plant thriving in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland. It requires full sun and is extremely drought-tolerant, needing minimal watering once established. Fertilization should be kept light to moderate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Desert soils are typically lean, so a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly, especially if growth seems stunted.
