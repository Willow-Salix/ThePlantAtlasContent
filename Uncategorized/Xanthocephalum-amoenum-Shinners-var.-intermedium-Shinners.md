## Introduction
Xanthocephalum is a genus of North American plants in the tribe Astereae within the family Asteraceae.
The name "Xanthocephalum" means "yellow head," from the Greek "xanthos," yellow and "kephale," head. The genus was once much larger than it is today, with many of its former members transferred to Gutierrezia in the 1980s.

## Care Guide
This Texas native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, adapted to semi-arid conditions. It requires minimal watering once established and generally needs no supplemental fertilizer. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; typically thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils without supplemental feeding. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
