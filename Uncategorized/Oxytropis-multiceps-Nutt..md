## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Rocky Mountains of the Western United States (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Montana) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), thriving in the open, exposed conditions typical of high-altitude environments. |
| **Watering** | Low; prefers dry conditions and well-draining soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established. |

## Introduction
Oxytropis is a genus of plants in the legume family. It includes over 600 species native to subarctic to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. It is one of three genera of plants known as locoweeds, and are notorious for being toxic to grazing animals. The other locoweed genus is the closely related Astragalus. Most oxtropis species are native to Eurasia and North America, but several species are native to the Arctic. These are hairy perennial plants which produce raceme inflorescences of pink, purple, white, or yellow flowers which are generally pea-like but have distinctive sharply beaked keels. The stems are leafless, the leaves being all basal. The plant produces legume pods containing the seeds.

## Care Guide
This hardy alpine plant demands full sun and exceptionally well-draining, lean soil to replicate its native rocky habitats. It requires very infrequent watering, being highly drought-tolerant, and benefits from minimal to no fertilization to prevent over-rich conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Native soils are typically lean and poor in nutrients. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen, making additional fertilization generally unnecessary.
