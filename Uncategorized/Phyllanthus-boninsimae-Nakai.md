## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Ogasawara Islands (Bonin Islands), Japan |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect light to partial shade. Protect from intense, direct midday sun, especially in warmer climates, mimicking its natural habitat beneath a canopy. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture. Water regularly to keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged, reflecting the humid and rainy conditions of its native islands. |

## Introduction
Phyllanthus is the largest genus in the plant family Phyllanthaceae. Estimates of the number of species in this genus vary widely, from 750 to 1200. Phyllanthus has a remarkable diversity of growth forms including annual and perennial herbs, shrubs, climbers, floating aquatics, and pachycaulous succulents. Some have flattened leaflike stems called cladodes. It has a wide variety of floral morphologies and chromosome numbers and has one of the widest range of pollen types of any seed plant genus.
Despite their variety, almost all Phyllanthus species express a specific type of growth called "phyllanthoid branching" in which the vertical stems bear deciduous, floriferous (flower-bearing), plagiotropic (horizontal or oblique) stems. The leaves on the main (vertical) axes are reduced to scales called "cataphylls", while leaves on the other axes develop normally.  Phyllanthus is distributed in all tropical and subtropical regions on Earth.
Phyllanthus was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, but the type was not designated.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Phyllanthus boninsimae needs a humid environment with bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide regular feeding during warmer months to support healthy growth, replicating its subtropical island origins.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, given the often nutrient-rich but also leachable soils of its native volcanic origin.
