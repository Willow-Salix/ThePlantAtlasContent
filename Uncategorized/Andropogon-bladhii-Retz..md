## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and is well-suited to tropical and subtropical grasslands. It requires moderate watering during active growth but is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing minimal fertilization for robust health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season, especially in nutrient-poor soils.
