| **Native Origin** | California, USA (specifically North Coast Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Mixed Evergreen Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in full sun in coastal and milder regions, but may benefit from afternoon shade in hotter inland areas. |
| **Watering** | Low; highly drought-tolerant once established. Requires minimal to no supplemental water, particularly during dry summer months. Overwatering can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## Care Guide
Whitehair Manzanita is a drought-tolerant California native that thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils under full sun to partial shade. It requires minimal watering once established and generally needs no fertilizer. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent issues.

### Fertilizer
Very low; adapted to nutrient-poor, often serpentine, soils. Avoid heavy fertilization; established plants generally do not require any fertilizer.
