## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North and Central America (specifically Mexico and the Southern United States) |
| **Climate** | Warm Temperate to Subtropical Plains |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. These plants typically grow in open, exposed fields in their native habitat, not under a forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | Consistent and deep watering is essential, especially during flowering and fruiting periods. Native environments often feature seasonal rainfall, so ensure regular moisture without waterlogging. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Cucurbita (Latin for 'gourd') is a genus of herbaceous fruits in the gourd family, Cucurbitaceae (also known as cucurbits or cucurbi), native to the Andes and Mesoamerica. Five edible species are grown and consumed for their flesh and seeds. They are variously known as squash, pumpkin, or gourd, depending on species, variety, and local parlance. Other kinds of gourd, also called bottle-gourds, are native to Africa and belong to the genus Lagenaria, which is in the same family and subfamily as Cucurbita, but in a different tribe; their young fruits are eaten much like those of the Cucurbita species.
There is debate about the taxonomy of the genus and the number of accepted species varies from 13 to 30. The five domesticated species are Cucurbita argyrosperma, C. ficifolia, C. maxima, C. moschata, and C. pepo, all of which can be treated as winter squash because the full-grown fruits can be stored for months. However, C. pepo includes some cultivars that are better used only as summer squash.
Most Cucurbita species are herbaceous vines that grow several meters in length and have tendrils, but non-vining "bush" cultivars of C. pepo and C. maxima have also been developed. The yellow or orange flowers on a Cucurbita plant are of two types: female and male. The female flowers produce the fruit and the male flowers produce pollen. Many North and Central American species are visited by specialist bee pollinators, but other insects with more general feeding habits, such as honey bees, also visit.
The fruits of the genus Cucurbita are good sources of nutrients, such as vitamin A and vitamin C, among other nutrients according to species. The fruits have many culinary uses including pumpkin pie, biscuits, bread, desserts, puddings, beverages, and soups; they are now cultivated worldwide. Although botanical fruits, Cucurbita gourds such as squash are typically cooked and eaten as vegetables. Pumpkins see more varied use, and are eaten both as vegetables and as desserts such as pumpkin pie.

## Care Guide
Ornamental gourds thrive in full sun and require consistent, deep watering, particularly as fruits develop. They are heavy feeders and perform best in rich, well-draining soil. Mimicking the warm, sunny conditions and reliable moisture of their native plains is crucial for success.

### Fertilizer
As vigorous growers and heavy fruit producers, gourds require fertile, nutrient-rich soil. In their native range, they benefit from decomposed organic matter. Supplement with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer, particularly one higher in phosphorus and potassium during the flowering and fruiting stages.
