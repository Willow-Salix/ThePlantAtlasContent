## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas) |
| **Climate** | Warm Temperate Dry Woodlands and Subtropical Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, as it naturally grows in open, exposed habitats like sandhills and pine flatwoods. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. |

## Introduction
Paronychia is an inflammation of the skin around the nail, often due to bacteria or fungi.  
Its sudden (acute) occurrence is usually due to the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Gradual (chronic) occurrences are typically caused by fungi, commonly Candida albicans. 
Risk factors for paronychia include frequent hand washing and trauma to the cuticle, such as from chronic nail biting or hangnails.
Treatment typically involves antibiotics for bacterial infections and antifungals for fungal infections. If there is pus formation, incision and drainage may be necessary.
Paronychia is commonly mistakenly used interchangeably with herpetic whitlow or felon, which are distinct conditions.

## Care Guide
American Nailwort thrives in conditions mimicking its native southeastern US dry woodlands and scrublands, requiring full sun and very infrequent watering. It is a low-maintenance plant that prefers poor, well-drained soils and does not need regular fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization needed; it is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils and excessive fertilizer can be detrimental.
