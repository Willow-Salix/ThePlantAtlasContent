## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (specifically Georgia, Florida, Alabama, South Carolina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in pine flatwoods, sandhills, and savannas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), consistent with its native habitat in open, exposed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; allow the soil to dry out between waterings. Reflects its adaptation to well-drained, sandy soils in a region with seasonal rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Amorpha is a genus of plants in the pea family, Fabaceae. All the species are native to North America, from southern Canada, most of the United States (US), and northern Mexico. They are commonly known as false indigo. The name Amorpha means "deformed" or "without form" in Greek and was given because flowers of this genus only have one petal, unlike the usual "pea-shaped" flowers of the Faboideae subfamily. Amorpha is missing the wing and keel petals.
The desert false indigo or indigo bush (Amorpha fruticosa), is a shrub that grows from 3 m to 5 m tall. The species is considered a rare species in the US state of West Virginia and in the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, but is considered an invasive plant in some areas of the northeastern and northwestern United States and in southeastern Canada, beyond its native range, and has also been introduced into Europe.
The lead plant (Amorpha canescens), a bushy shrub, is an important North American prairie legume. Lead plant is often associated with little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), a common prairie grass. Native Americans used the dried leaves of lead plant for pipe smoking and tea.
Amorpha species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia lucens, which feeds exclusively on the genus.
Amorphol, a rotenoid bioside, can be isolated from plants of the genus Amorpha.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Georgia False Indigo thrives in full sun and prefers well-drained, sandy soils, mimicking its native open flatwoods and sandhill environments. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and benefits from little to no fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is needed, particularly nitrogen, as it is a legume (Fabaceae) and fixes its own nitrogen, thriving in its naturally less fertile, sandy native soils.
