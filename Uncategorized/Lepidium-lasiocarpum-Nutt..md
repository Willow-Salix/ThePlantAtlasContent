| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (including California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Texas) and Northern Mexico (Baja California) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure is ideal for this plant, reflecting its native open, exposed habitats in deserts and scrublands. It can tolerate some partial shade but prefers direct sunlight. |

## Introduction
Lepidium is a genus of plants in the mustard/cabbage family, Brassicaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. It includes familiar species such as garden cress, maca, and dittander. General common names include peppercress, peppergrass, pepperweed, and pepperwort.  Some species form tumbleweeds.
The genus name Lepidium is from Greek meaning 'small scale', which is thought to be derived from a folk medicine usage of the plant to treat leprosy, which cause small scales on the skin. Another meaning is related to the small scale-like fruit.

## Care Guide
This annual plant thrives in full sun and is exceptionally drought-tolerant, mirroring its arid native habitat. It prefers well-draining, infertile soils and requires minimal watering once established. Avoid over-fertilization to ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to poor to average, well-draining soils and does not require rich fertilization. Excessive nutrients can be harmful.
