## 🧤 Care Instructions
Common Lousewort prefers bright indirect to partial sun and consistently moist, acidic soil, typical of its native European heathland habitat. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, and avoid over-fertilizing as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and can be sensitive to high nutrient levels.
