## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Interior Alaska, Yukon, Northwest Territories, British Columbia |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring high light exposure due to its treeless native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking boggy or snowmelt conditions, as it is adapted to poorly drained tundra environments. |

## Introduction
Pedicularis sudetica, common names of which are fernweed, Sudeten lousewort, Sedetic lousewort, and Sudetic lousewort is a species of flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae which is native to Poland, the former Czechoslovakia, and northern Russia to the Urals, but can now be found in such US states as Alaska, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Canada since it was introduced there. The plant is both  perennial and bisexual. It grows 0.3 m (1 ft 0 in) high with the flowers being hermaphrodite.

## Care Guide
This alpine tundra plant thrives in consistently moist to wet, nutrient-poor soil under full to partial sun exposure. It requires cold hardy conditions and does not tolerate drought or rich, warm soils, mimicking its native boggy or snowmelt environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to none, as native tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor and high fertility can be detrimental.
