## Introduction
Chenopodium is a genus of numerous species of perennial or annual herbaceous flowering plants known as the goosefoot, which occur almost anywhere in the world. It is placed in the family Amaranthaceae in the APG II system; older classification systems, notably the widely used Cronquist system, separate it and its relatives as Chenopodiaceae, but this leaves the rest of the Amaranthaceae polyphyletic. However, among the Amaranthaceae, the genus Chenopodium is the namesake member of the subfamily Chenopodioideae.

## Care Guide
Manyseed Goosefoot is a hardy plant native to temperate regions, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. This adaptable plant is well-suited to conditions mimicking its open, disturbed native habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This species is often found in nutrient-average or disturbed soils and does not typically require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced fertilizer can be given if growth seems sluggish.
