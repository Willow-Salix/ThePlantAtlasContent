## Care Guide
Provide this plant with full sun exposure and well-draining soil, mimicking its native open, arid environments. Water sparingly, only when the soil is completely dry, and avoid heavy fertilization to prevent harm.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; it is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils and over-fertilization can be detrimental.
