## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Greenland, and subarctic regions of eastern Canada (Labrador, Newfoundland, Quebec) and northeastern USA (Maine). |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Subarctic |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers open, bright conditions during its growing season, characteristic of arctic landscapes without significant tree canopy. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil is essential, particularly during the active growth period, mimicking the saturated conditions from snowmelt and poor drainage common in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This cold-hardy willow thrives in full sun and consistently moist, calcareous soil, characteristic of its arctic and subarctic origins. It requires minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. Ensure it receives abundant light and consistent moisture, especially during its short growing season.

### Fertilizer
Low. Arctic soils are generally nutrient-poor with slow decomposition rates. Light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year, or even less, is typically sufficient.
