## Introduction
In Greek mythology, the name Chloris (; Greek Χλωρίς Chlōrís, from χλωρός chlōrós, meaning "greenish-yellow", "pale green", "pale", "pallid", or "fresh") appears in a variety of contexts. Some clearly refer to different characters; other stories may refer to the same Chloris, but disagree on details.

Chloris, a nymph loved by Zephyrus (West Wind).
Chloris, wife of Neleus, king of Pylos. It is, however, not always clear whether she or the below Chloris is mentioned in this role.
Chloris, one of the Niobids.
Chloris, daughter of Orchomenus, married the seer Ampyx (son of Elatus or Titairon), with whom she had a child Mopsus who also became a renowned seer and would later join the Argonauts. The Argonautica Orphica calls her by a different name, Aregonis. In some accounts, she mothered Mopsus by Zeus.

## Care Guide
Many-fingered Grass is a sun-loving, resilient plant that thrives in full sun exposure. It is well-adapted to fluctuating moisture, handling both regular watering and periods of drought. This low-maintenance grass generally requires minimal fertilization, reflecting its adaptable nature in tropical grasslands.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a grass often found in varied soil conditions, it typically does not require heavy fertilization; a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient if desired.
