## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest/Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in areas with good light exposure, such as forest edges and clearings. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, mimicking the consistent rainfall of its native habitat. Tolerates some drought once established. |

## Introduction
The blackberry is an edible fruit ("berry") produced by many species in the genus Rubus in the family Rosaceae, hybrids among these species within the subgenus Rubus, and hybrids between the subgenera Rubus and Idaeobatus. The taxonomy of blackberries has historically been confused because of hybridization and apomixis so that species have often been grouped together and called species aggregates.
Blackberry fruit production is abundant with annual volumes of 20,000 pounds (9,100 kg) per 1 acre (0.40 ha) possible, making this plant commercially attractive.
Rubus armeniacus (Himalayan or Armenian blackberry) is considered a noxious weed and invasive species in many regions of the Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States, where it grows out of control in urban and suburban parks and woodlands.

## Care Guide
Rubus alacer thrives in conditions similar to its native humid subtropical environment. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure consistent soil moisture. Fertilize moderately during the growing season to support healthy growth and fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilizer needs. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or organic matter during the growing season in typical forest-edge soils.
