## Care Guide
Pentzia, native to the arid to semi-arid shrublands of Southern Africa, thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant. It needs infrequent watering, allowing soil to dry completely, and has minimal fertilizer requirements, making it an excellent low-maintenance plant for dry, sunny locations.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Fertilize lightly, if at all, during the growing season.
