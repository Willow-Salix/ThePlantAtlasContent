## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across mountainous and rocky regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine, Boreal, and Temperate Montane zones on exposed siliceous rocks. |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure, often direct sun, typical of exposed rock faces in mountainous environments. |
| **Watering** | Requires intermittent moisture from rain, dew, or atmospheric humidity, but can tolerate prolonged dry periods. Good air circulation is essential; avoid constant wetness. |

## Introduction
Dermatocarpon is a genus of lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. Members of the genus are commonly called stippleback lichens because they have fruiting structures called perithecia that are flask-shaped structures embedded in the nonfruiting body (thallus), with a hole in the top to release spores, causing an appearance of being covered with small black dots. Its species are told apart chiefly by spore size, the colour and texture of the lower surface, and whether the epinecral layer gives a pruinose bloom.

## Care Guide
This rock-dwelling lichen thrives in high light conditions with excellent air circulation, mimicking its native exposed mountain habitats. It needs intermittent moisture, allowing for dry periods between hydration cycles. Avoid any form of traditional fertilization, as it is self-sufficient and sensitive to nutrient overload.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens are extremely sensitive to nutrient enrichment and derive what they need from air and rainwater.
