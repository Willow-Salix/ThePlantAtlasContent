## 🌱 Overview
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions typical of arctic-alpine environments. Provide intermittent moisture, allowing for dry periods, and avoid any fertilization. Good air circulation is important.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain nutrients from their substrate and the atmosphere; fertilization can be harmful.
