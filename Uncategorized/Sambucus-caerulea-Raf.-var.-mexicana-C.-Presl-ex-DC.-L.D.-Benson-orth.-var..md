## Care Guide
Mexican Elderberry is an adaptable shrub or small tree thriving in full sun to partial shade in Mediterranean and semi-arid climates. It requires moderate watering, preferring to dry out between sessions, and has low fertilizer needs, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied annually in spring to promote vigorous growth, or simply amend soil with compost.
