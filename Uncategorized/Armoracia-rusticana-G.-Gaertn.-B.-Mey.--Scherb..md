## Care Guide
Horseradish thrives in temperate climates with full to partial sun exposure. It prefers consistently moist, well-draining, and moderately fertile soil, benefiting from regular watering and annual fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Moderately fertile, well-draining soil. Benefits from incorporating organic matter (compost) or a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer annually, especially for root production.
