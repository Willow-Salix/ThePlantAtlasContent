## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, characteristic of its arid native habitat. It is well-adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making heavy fertilization unnecessary. Focus on well-draining soil and infrequent, deep irrigation to emulate its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Adapted to nutrient-poor, often saline, soils. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be used but is often not critical.
