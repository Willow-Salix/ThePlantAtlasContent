## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions across Asia (including Southeast Asia, Japan, China, India), Africa, Australia, and Pacific Islands. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Moist Forest (typically forest floor or understory) |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to dappled light; avoid direct, intense sunlight which can scorch leaves, mimicking their native forest understory habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is crucial during the active growing season; allow the top layer of the potting medium to slightly dry out between waterings. Reduce frequency significantly for deciduous species during their dormant period, ensuring good drainage is always provided. |

## 🌱 Overview
Calanthe, commonly known as Christmas orchids, is a genus of about 220 species of orchids in the family Orchidaceae. They are evergreen or deciduous terrestrial plants with thick roots, small oval pseudobulbs, large corrugated leaves and upright, sometimes arching flowering stems. The sepals and petals are narrow and a similar size to each other and the labellum usually has spreading lobes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Calanthe orchids thrive in conditions mimicking their native moist forest floor habitat, requiring partial shade to dappled light and consistent moisture during active growth with excellent drainage. Fertilize moderately during the growing season to support their robust development. Reduce watering for deciduous species during their dormant period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeders. Apply a balanced, diluted orchid-specific fertilizer (e.g., at half-strength) during the active growing season, capitalizing on the nutrient-rich organic matter typically found in their forest floor origins.
