## 🧤 Care Instructions
The California Blackberry thrives in full sun to partial shade within a temperate, Mediterranean climate. Once established, it is quite drought-tolerant but benefits from moderate watering during prolonged dry spells and fruit production. It generally requires low to moderate fertilization, preferring well-drained soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied in early spring if soil is poor or growth is insufficient; otherwise, it is generally not essential.
