## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (including parts of USA and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate (found in mesic environments, often on disturbed ground) |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to partial sun. Prefers filtered light or morning sun to prevent desiccation, but can tolerate some direct sun if moisture is consistent. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistent moisture; the substrate should be kept damp but not waterlogged. Tolerates brief dry spells by entering dormancy, but active growth demands regular hydration. |

## Introduction
Funaria is a genus of approximately 210 species of moss. Funaria hygrometrica is the most common species. Funaria hygrometrica is called “cord moss” because of the twisted seta which is very hygroscopic and untwists when moist. The name is derived from the Latin word “funis”, meaning "a rope". In funaria root like structures called rhizoids are present.
Capsules are abundant with the moss surviving as spore when conditions are not suitable.
Moss plant Funaria grows in dense patches or cushions in moist shady and cool places on rocks, walls or crevices during the rainy seasons. It has a height of 3–5 cm, a radial symmetry with a differentiation of an axis or stem, leaves or phylloids are multicellular colorless branched rhizoids with oblique septa.
These are primitive multicellular, autotrophic, shade loving, amphibious plants. They reproduce by spore formation. They have no vascular system. Root like structures called rhizoids are present. They show alternation of generation i.e. the gametophytic stage alternates with the sporophytic stage.

## Care Guide
Funaria moss thrives in temperate conditions with consistent moisture and moderate, filtered sun. Ensure its substrate remains damp but never waterlogged to support active growth. It has very low nutrient demands, making additional fertilization unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Low. Mosses are not heavy feeders. Typically no additional fertilization is required as they absorb nutrients from water and their immediate environment.
