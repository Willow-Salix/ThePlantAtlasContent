## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains, Alaska, Canada) and Fennoscandia |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to dappled sunlight; avoid intense, direct sun, especially during the hottest parts of the day. |
| **Watering** | Requires high ambient humidity and regular moisture from precipitation (rain, fog, dew). Mimic this with frequent misting in cultivation; it does not have roots to absorb water from soil. |

## Introduction
Melanelia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. These lichens typically grow on rocks and form relatively large, leaf-like structures with brown to blackish upper surfaces and pale undersides. The genus originally included many more species, but most have since been moved to related genera like Melanohalea and Melanelixia, leaving only five accepted species today.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, humid conditions with dappled light, mimicking its native temperate to boreal forest environment. It requires consistent ambient moisture and high humidity, absorbing water directly from the air, and does not need traditional fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed; traditional fertilizers are detrimental and can harm or kill the lichen.
