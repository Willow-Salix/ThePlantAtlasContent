## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Asia (e.g., Philippines, Southeast Asia) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Savanna / Tropical Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with open grassland exposure. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is tolerant of short dry spells but thrives with regular moisture during active growth, mimicking wet and dry seasons. |

## Care Guide
This tropical grass thrives in full sun conditions, much like its native savanna habitat. It prefers moderate watering, allowing for some drying between sessions, and is well-adapted to alkaline soils. Overall, it is a relatively low-maintenance plant suited for sunny, well-drained locations.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Being adapted to limestone soils, it prefers alkaline conditions and does not require rich, heavily fertilized soil. A general-purpose, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
