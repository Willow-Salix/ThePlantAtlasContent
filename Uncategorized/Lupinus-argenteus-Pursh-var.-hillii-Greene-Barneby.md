| **Climate** | Montane/Semi-Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) as it typically grows in open meadows, scrublands, and forest edges. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Silver Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained, even poor, soils, reflecting its native montane and semi-arid origins. It is drought-tolerant once established and should be watered infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires little to no fertilizer, particularly avoiding high-nitrogen formulations.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers which can inhibit flowering.
