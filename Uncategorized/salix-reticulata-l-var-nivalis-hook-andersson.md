## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Cascade Range), high alpine regions |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Subalpine |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, accustomed to high light exposure above the treeline. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist but very well-drained soil, especially during the growing season. Tolerates moisture from snowmelt but not prolonged waterlogging. Reduced watering in dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine willow requires a cool climate with full to partial sun exposure and very well-drained soil that remains consistently moist during its short growing season. Mimic its native rocky, lean soil conditions and avoid rich soil or heavy fertilization, ensuring excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. Thrives in lean, rocky, well-drained soils typical of alpine environments.
