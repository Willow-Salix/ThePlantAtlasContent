## Introduction
Stylosanthes is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae and contains numerous highly important pasture and forage species. It was recently assigned to the informal monophyletic Pterocarpus clade of the Dalbergieae. The common name pencilflower is sometimes used for plants in this genus.

## Care Guide
Tropical Stylo thrives in full sun within tropical and subtropical climates, adapting well to moderate watering during its growing season and showing high drought tolerance. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it requires minimal fertilization. This makes it a resilient and relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Benefits from phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients, especially in nutrient-poor soils, but generally does not require heavy fertilization.
