## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Washington State, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate; found in moist, disturbed mineral soil habitats such as forest openings, roadsides, and stream banks. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers partial sun to bright indirect light. Can tolerate some direct morning sun but should be protected from intense afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist conditions; the growing medium should never be allowed to dry out completely. High ambient humidity is beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Physcomitrium is a genus of mosses, commonly called urn moss after its urn-like calyptra, that includes about 80 species and has a cosmopolitan distribution. The scientific name comes from the Ancient Greek words physkē, meaning large intestine or sausage, and mitrion, meaning little turban. The common name is derived from its symmetrical, erect and urn-like capsules that lack peristomes, these features characterising the genus. They are commonly found on exposed soils that are often associated with locations that become very wet in the spring, such as along river banks or on alluvial mud. They occur from near sea level to about 2500 metres. The capsules mature over the winter and into the spring.
Many species were once circumscribed within the species Physcomitrium pyriforme, which over time has been broken up into many separate species based on variation of the sporophyte and gametophyte.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in consistently moist environments with partial sun to bright indirect light, replicating its natural habitat on damp, disturbed mineral soil. Ensure high humidity and never allow its growing medium to dry out completely. Fertilization is generally not required due to its low nutrient demands.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Has very low nutrient requirements; typically does not need regular fertilization. If desired, a highly diluted, moss-specific liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice a year.
