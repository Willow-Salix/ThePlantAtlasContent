## Care Guide
Rush featherling thrives in consistently wet, acidic soil with moderate to full sun exposure, mimicking its native bog and wet savanna habitats. It requires high humidity and minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments, making over-fertilization detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers nutrient-poor, acidic soil typical of its boggy habitats.
