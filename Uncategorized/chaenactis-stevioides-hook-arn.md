## 🌱 Overview
Chaenactis is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae which are known generally as pincushions and dustymaidens.
These wildflowers are native to western North America, especially the desert southwest of the United States. They are quite variable in appearance. They are generally aster-like in appearance with many disc florets in each head. There may be only disc florets, but sometimes there are also enlarged ray florets along the edges of the corolla. They may be white to yellow or pink.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Esteve's pincushion thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrublands, requiring full sun and well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. Ensure the soil dries out completely between waterings to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs; adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils, so excessive fertilization is not recommended.
