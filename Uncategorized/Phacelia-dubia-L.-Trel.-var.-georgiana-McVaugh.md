## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Georgia, also South Carolina, Alabama, and northern Florida) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in open woodlands, clearings, and disturbed areas within this biome) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers brighter conditions during its active growth in spring, often before deciduous trees fully leaf out. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during its growing season. Can tolerate short dry spells once established, but benefits from regular watering during prolonged dry periods. |

## Introduction
Phacelia (phacelia, scorpionweed, heliotrope) is a genus of about 200 species of annual or perennial herbaceous plants in the borage family, native to North and South America. California is particularly rich in species with over 90 recorded in the region.
The genus is traditionally placed at family rank with the waterleafs (Hydrophyllaceae) in the order Boraginales. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, recognizing that the traditional Boraginaceae and Hydrophyllaceae are paraphyletic with respect to each other, merges the latter into the former and considers the family basal in the Euasterids I clade. Other botanists continue to recognize the Hydrophyllaceae and Boraginales after analysing the secondary structure of the ITS1 genetic region rather than its sequence for these higher taxonomic levels.  This placed Phacelia within the Hydrophyllaceae. Further molecular taxonomic analysis of the Boraginales has divided the Boraginales in two and placed Phacelia among the monophyletic herbaceous Hydrophyllaceae in Boraginales II.
The genus includes both annual and perennial species. Many have been cultivated as garden and honey plants.
There are reports that glandular hairs of stems, flowers and leaves of some species of Phacelia secrete oil droplets that can cause an unpleasant skin rash (contact dermatitis) in some people, specifically from P. brachyloba, P. campanularia, P. crenulata, P. gina-glenneae, P. grandiflora, P. ixodes, P. minor, and P. pedicellata. The major contact allergen of P. crenulata has been identified as geranylhydroquinone and of P. minor as geranylgeranylhydroquinone.
The mining bee Andrena phaceliae is a specialist pollinator of this genus in the Eastern United States.

## Care Guide
This annual wildflower thrives in the humid subtropical climate of the Southeastern US, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance option for naturalized gardens or spring displays.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; it is adapted to average to poor soil conditions typical of its native habitat and does not require rich fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
