# Mexican Brachymenium Moss
### *Brachymenium mexicanum Mont.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mexico, Central America (e.g., Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica), northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia), and the Caribbean. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Montane Cloud Forest and Humid Subtropical/Tropical Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect bright light; it naturally grows under a forest canopy or in misty conditions, so direct, intense sunlight should be avoided to prevent desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist conditions, never allowing the substrate to dry out completely. High ambient humidity is critical; regular misting or placement in a terrarium/humid environment is highly beneficial. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in environments mimicking its native humid tropical montane habitats. Provide consistent moisture and very high humidity, along with low to indirect bright light to prevent drying. Fertilization should be minimal to none.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very minimal; mosses are low nutrient consumers. A highly diluted (1/4 strength) balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied once or twice a year during active growth, or often none is needed.
