## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in well-draining soil under partial to full sun exposure, adapting to its native Mediterranean climate. Provide consistent watering during spring growth, then reduce significantly in summer to align with its natural drought tolerance. Due to its nitrogen-fixing nature, it requires minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally does not require high nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth appears weak.
