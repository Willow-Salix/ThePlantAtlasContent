## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and California), specifically within the Mojave and Great Basin deserts. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun is essential, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflecting its native open desert habitat with intense solar exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Highly drought-tolerant, requiring very infrequent watering. Water deeply when the soil is completely dry, and significantly reduce or cease watering during cooler, dormant periods to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Agave (; also UK: ; Anglo-Hispanic, also US: ) is a genus of monocots native to the arid regions of the Americas. The genus is primarily known for its succulent and xerophytic species that typically form large rosettes of strong, fleshy leaves.
Many plants in this genus may be considered perennial, because they require several to many years to mature and flower. However, most Agave species are more accurately described as monocarpic rosettes or multiannuals, since each individual rosette flowers only once and then dies; a small number of Agave species are polycarpic.
Along with plants from the closely related genera Yucca, Hesperoyucca, and Hesperaloe, various Agave species are popular ornamental plants in hot, dry climates, as they require very little supplemental water to survive. Most Agave species grow very slowly. Some Agave species are known by the common name "century plant".
Maguey is a Spanish word that refers to all of the large-leafed plants in the Asparagaceae family, including agaves and yuccas. Maguey flowers are eaten in many indigenous culinary traditions of Mesoamerica.
In other regions, it goes by different names; in China, it is referred to as Chinese: 龙舌兰, romanized: Lóngshélán, lit. 'dragon tongue orchid'.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Utah Agave is a robust desert plant that thrives on neglect. It requires full, intense sun and excellent drainage, with very infrequent watering, especially during dormancy. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it is adapted to poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. It naturally thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky, and sandy desert soils. If desired, a very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring during active growth.
