## Introduction
Dianthus ( dy-AN-thəs) is a genus of about 340 species of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae, native mainly to Europe and Asia, with a few species in north Africa and in southern Africa, and one species (D. repens) in arctic North America.

## Care Guide
Velezia rigida thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its Mediterranean habitat. Provide moderate water during its active growth cycle, allowing it to dry out between waterings, and minimize water during its summer dormancy. Fertilization should be light, as it is adapted to less fertile conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season, especially in poor soils.
