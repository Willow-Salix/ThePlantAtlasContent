## Introduction
Chamaecrista is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Members of the genus are commonly known as sensitive pea. Several species are capable of rapid plant movement. Unlike the related genera Cassia and Senna, members of Chamaecrista form root nodules.
Chamaecrista has 367 species, with a wide distribution – the Americas from Minnesota to northern Argentina, sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Iran, the Indian Subcontinent, Indochina, China, Korea, Japan, Malesia, New Guinea, and Australia.

## Care Guide
This slender sensitive pea thrives in warm, humid conditions with full sun exposure and consistently moist, well-drained soil. As a legume, it requires minimal fertilization, preferring a light feeding or good organic matter. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen fertilization is unnecessary. A light, balanced fertilizer or compost once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
