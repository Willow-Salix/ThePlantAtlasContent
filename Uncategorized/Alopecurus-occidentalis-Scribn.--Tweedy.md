## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Rocky Mountains region (e.g., Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Montane Meadow / Alpine Temperate |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil; frequent watering, ensuring the soil never dries out completely, mimicking its native wet meadow habitat. |

## Introduction
Alopecurus, or foxtail grass, is a common and widespread genus of plants in the grass family. It is common across temperate and subtropical parts of Eurasia, northern Africa, and the Americas, as well as naturalized in Australia and on various islands.
Foxtails can be annual or perennial. They grow in tufts. They have flat leaves and blunt ligules (a small flap at the junction of leaf and stem). Their inflorescence is a dense panicle (a branching head without terminal flower) with 1-flowered spikelets. A few, particularly A. myosuroides, are considered weeds, others are very decorative and are used in bouquets of dried flowers.

## Care Guide
Western Foxtail thrives in full sun with consistently moist soil, replicating its natural montane meadow environment. Regular watering is crucial to prevent the soil from drying out, especially during warm periods. It benefits from a moderate annual fertilization to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied annually in spring is sufficient, as native meadow soils are typically moderately rich in organic matter.
