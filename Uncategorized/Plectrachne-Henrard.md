## Introduction
Triodia is a large genus of hummock grass endemic to Australia.  The species of this genus are known by the common name spinifex, although they are not a part of the coastal genus Spinifex. Many soft-leaved Triodia species were formerly included in the genus Plectrachne. Triodia is known as tjanpi (grass) in central Australia, and have several traditional uses amongst the Aboriginal Australian peoples of the region.
A multiaccess key (SpiKey) is available as a free application for identifying the Triodia of the Pilbara (28 species and one hybrid).

## Care Guide
This plant, characteristic of Australian spinifex grasses, thrives in full sun and requires very little water due to its desert origins. It is highly adapted to poor soils and needs minimal to no fertilizer, making it suitable for very low-maintenance, arid conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils; minimal to no fertilizer is needed.
