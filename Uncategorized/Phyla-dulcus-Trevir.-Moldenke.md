## Care Guide
Honeyherb thrives in partial to full shade, requiring consistently moist, well-draining soil to mimic its tropical forest origins. Protect it from direct, intense sunlight and provide light to moderate fertilization during its growing period for best results.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied monthly during the active growing season to support its vigorous growth.
