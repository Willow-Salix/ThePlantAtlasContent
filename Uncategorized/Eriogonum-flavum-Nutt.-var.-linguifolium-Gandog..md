## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Rocky Mountains region of the United States and Canada (e.g., Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Idaho). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Dry Meadow/Steppe or Subalpine/Alpine Dry Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in exposed, open habitats. |
| **Watering** | Very low; highly drought-tolerant once established. Allow soil to dry out completely between infrequent waterings, typical of its arid native environment. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
This resilient perennial requires full sun and thrives in lean, very well-drained soils, characteristic of its native dry mountain habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs very infrequent watering, with minimal to no fertilizer required.

### Fertilizer
None or very low; thrives in poor, rocky, infertile soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
