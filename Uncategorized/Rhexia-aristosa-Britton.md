## Care Guide
Awnpetal Meadowbeauty thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet to moist, acidic soil, reflecting its native bog and wet savanna habitats in the southeastern US. It is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, so fertilize sparingly with a product suitable for acid-loving plants, ensuring the soil never fully dries out.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; prefers acidic, nutrient-poor soils common in its native habitat. Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly, if at all.
