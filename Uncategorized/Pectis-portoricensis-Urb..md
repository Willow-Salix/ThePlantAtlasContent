## Introduction
Pectis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1759.
The name is derived from the Latin word pecten, meaning "comb." It refers to the marginally-bristled leaves or the pappus form.  These plants vary in appearance but they usually bear yellow daisy-like flower heads. Members of the genus are known generally as cinchweeds (current usage) or chinchweeds (older name).
They are native to the Americas, including the West Indies.

## Care Guide
Provide this plant with ample sunlight and ensure regular watering, allowing for slight drying between sessions. Fertilize lightly during its active growth. This plant is adapted to tropical conditions with distinct wet and dry periods.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season, as it naturally grows in often sandy or rocky, somewhat nutrient-poor soils.
