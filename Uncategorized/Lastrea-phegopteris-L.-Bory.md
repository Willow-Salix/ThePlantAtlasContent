## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America (Canada, northern US), Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest (specifically, moist, shady understory) |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers low to partial light, mimicking its natural habitat on the forest floor. Avoid direct sun, which can scorch its delicate fronds. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, never allowing it to dry out completely. Benefits from high humidity, often found near streams or damp rocks in its native habitat. |

## Care Guide
The Long Beech Fern thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shady conditions, mirroring its temperate forest origins. Provide ample humidity and protect it from direct sunlight to ensure lush frond growth and overall health.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient, as it naturally grows in soils rich in decaying organic matter but not overly fertile. A diluted balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season is adequate.
