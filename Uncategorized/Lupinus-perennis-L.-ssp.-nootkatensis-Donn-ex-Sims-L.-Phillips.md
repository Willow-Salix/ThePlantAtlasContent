## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
The Nootka Lupine flourishes in cool, moist temperate climates with ample sunlight to partial shade. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native habitat's rainfall. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it needs minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to None (as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in poor soils and can be harmed by high nitrogen fertilizer)
