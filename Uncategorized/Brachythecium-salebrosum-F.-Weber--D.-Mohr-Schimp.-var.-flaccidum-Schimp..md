## Care Guide
To care for Flaccid Brachythecium Moss, replicate its native temperate forest environment by providing low to moderate light and high humidity. Ensure the substrate remains consistently moist but well-drained. Fertilization is generally not necessary, as mosses are not heavy feeders.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; mosses derive nutrients from their environment and do not require rich soils. If used, apply a highly diluted solution sparingly.
