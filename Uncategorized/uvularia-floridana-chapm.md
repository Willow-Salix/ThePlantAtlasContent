## 🌱 Overview
Uvularia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Colchicaceae, which is closely related to the lily family (Liliaceae). They are commonly called bellworts, bellflowers, or merrybells. The genus name is derived from the Latin ūvula meaning "little grape", likely because of the way the flowers hang downward. For the same reason Uvularia may also refer to the similarly derived palatine uvula, which hangs down from the soft palate in the mouth. The plants are often found growing on wooded slopes or in ravines and they spread by stolons, or stoloniferous rhizomes. The plants are usually 45–60 cm (18–24 in) in height and bear one or two flowers per stem in April and May, that hang downward from the axils of the leaves.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Florida bellwort thrives in partial to full shade, mirroring its native woodland understory. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting the humid subtropical conditions of its origin. Provide moderate nutrients, ideally through organic matter, to support its robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderately rich soil; benefits from organic matter or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring.
