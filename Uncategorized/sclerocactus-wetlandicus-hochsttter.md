## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, allowing its soil to thoroughly dry between applications. Provide a well-draining soil mix and consider minimal or no fertilization for optimal health, mimicking its nutrient-poor native habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. If fertilized, use a highly diluted, low-nitrogen cactus-specific formula once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer).
