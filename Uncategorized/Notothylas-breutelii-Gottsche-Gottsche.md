# Breutel's Notothylas

*Notothylas breutelii (Gottsche) Gottsche* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caribbean islands (e.g., Cuba, Puerto Rico) and tropical regions of Central and South America (e.g., Brazil) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can quickly dry out and damage the plant. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is critical; the substrate must be kept continuously damp but not waterlogged. Requires very high atmospheric humidity to thrive. |

## Introduction
Notothylas is a genus of hornworts in the family Notothyladaceae. The genus is found globally, but is usually overlooked.  It is the smallest of all the hornworts, with a yellow-green gametophyte thallus that is seldom more than a centimeter in diameter, and usually much smaller.
The genus Notothylas is also unusual among hornworts in that the sporophyte is bullet-shaped and does not grow very large (less than two millimeters).  The sporophytes grow outwards rather than upwards, and like Megaceros, there are no stomata on the surface of the sporophyte.  The elater cells do not grow helical thickenings.
Unlike many hornworts, species in Notothylas tolerate full sunlight.
A number of classification systems place Notothylas in its own order Notothyladales (frequently misspelled Notothylales in the literature).  This classification is based on the assumption that the unique physical characteristics of the genus reflect an early divergence from other hornworts. However, this assumption is not supported by either phylogenetic analysis or fossil evidence.  More recent classifications expand the definition of the family Notothyladaceae to include four other genera.

## Care Guide
Breutel's Notothylas requires a consistently damp environment with very high humidity, mimicking its tropical moist forest habitat. It thrives in low to moderate indirect light and has minimal nutrient demands, making fertilization largely unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. Hornworts typically acquire sufficient nutrients from their substrate and environment, and excessive fertilization can be harmful.
