## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
Gray's Hawthorn thrives in temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade to mimic its native woodland edge habitat. It requires moderate, consistent watering and is adaptable to various soil types with low to moderate fertility. Mimicking its resilient native environment ensures healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; can grow in average to poor soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. An annual application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial for younger plants or those in very poor soil.
