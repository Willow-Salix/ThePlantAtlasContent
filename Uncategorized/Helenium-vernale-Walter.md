## Introduction
Helenium is a genus of annuals and herbaceous perennial plants in the family Asteraceae, native to the Americas.
They bear yellow or orange daisy-like composite flowers. A number of these species (particularly Helenium autumnale) have the common name sneezeweed, based on the former use of their dried leaves in making snuff. It was inhaled to cause sneezing that would supposedly rid the body of evil spirits. Larger species may grow up to 2 metres (6.6 ft) tall.
The genus is named for Helen of Troy, daughter of Zeus and Leda.
Helenium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Phymatopus behrensii.
Genus level properties: most conspicuously globe-like disk-shaped flowers, rays three-lobed at tip.

## Care Guide
This perennial thrives in full sun and consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native boggy and savanna habitats of the southeastern U.S. Provide moderate fertility and ensure it never completely dries out to encourage robust growth and abundant spring blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility; benefits from an annual application of compost or a light, balanced fertilizer in spring.
