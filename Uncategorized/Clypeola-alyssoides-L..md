## Care Guide
Clypeola Alyssoides thrives in full sun and well-drained, even poor, soils, mimicking its Mediterranean origins. Water moderately during its active spring growth, then significantly reduce watering for its summer dormancy. This plant requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. A light application of balanced fertilizer or compost in spring is sufficient, or none if soil is amended regularly.
