## Introduction
Campanula () is the type genus of the Campanulaceae family of flowering plants. Campanula are commonly known as bellflowers and take both their common and scientific names from the bell-shaped flowers—campanula is Latin for "little bell".
The genus includes over 500 species and several subspecies, distributed across the temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with centers of diversity in the Mediterranean region, Balkans, Caucasus and mountains of western Asia. The range also extends into mountains in tropical regions of Asia and Africa.

The species include annual, biennial and perennial plants, and vary in habit from dwarf arctic and alpine species under 5 cm high, to large temperate grassland and woodland species growing to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, bright conditions mimicking its native alpine and subalpine habitats. Provide full sun to partial shade and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil. It requires low to moderate fertilization, making it a relatively undemanding perennial suitable for rock gardens or borders.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich soil.
