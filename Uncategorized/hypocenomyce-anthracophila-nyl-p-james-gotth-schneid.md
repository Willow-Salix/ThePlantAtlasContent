## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate and Boreal Forests (often found in disturbed, open, well-lit sites like burnt wood or acidic bark within these biomes). |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure to bright indirect light. This lichen prefers open, well-lit conditions, avoiding deep shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high ambient humidity and regular moisture from misting or rainfall, absorbing water directly from the air and substrate. It tolerates periods of dryness but thrives with consistent access to moisture, avoiding waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hypocenomyce is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ophioparmaceae. Species in the genus grow on bark and on wood, especially on burned tree stumps and trunks in coniferous forest. Hypocenomyce lichens are widely distributed in the northern hemisphere.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in bright, open conditions with high ambient humidity, typically growing on burnt wood or acidic bark rather than in soil. It requires regular moisture from misting or ambient humidity for metabolic activity, but no traditional fertilizers are needed as it absorbs nutrients directly from the environment. Ensure good air circulation to maintain health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens are highly sensitive to high nutrient levels and derive necessary elements directly from air and precipitation. Fertilization is generally detrimental.
