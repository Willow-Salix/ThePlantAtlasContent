## Care Guide
This high-desert native demands full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its arid habitat. Water sparingly during its active growth period and provide a completely dry dormancy through fall and winter, with minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low. A dilute, balanced cactus fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season, or not at all if repotted annually into fresh soil.
