## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, specifically cool temperate wetlands in regions such as Quebec, Newfoundland, Maine, and New York. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Wetland (Bogs and Swamps) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth, reflecting its open wetland habitat. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently wet to moist soil, mimicking its native bog and swamp environments. It is highly intolerant of drought. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
Laurent's Willow thrives in consistently wet soil and full to partial sun, reflecting its natural habitat in temperate bogs and swamps. It demands high moisture and does not tolerate dry conditions, while having relatively low to moderate nutrient requirements.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to soils that may not be exceptionally rich. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is generally sufficient, or none if soil conditions are naturally fertile.
