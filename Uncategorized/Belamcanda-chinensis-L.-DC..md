## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Asia, specifically China, Japan, and Korea |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it grows in open grassy slopes and forest edges, suggesting it thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sun or bright, indirect light daily. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Reflecting its temperate origins, allow the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot, as consistent saturation is not typical in its native, well-drained environments. |

## Introduction
Iris domestica, commonly known as leopard lily, blackberry lily, and leopard flower, is an ornamental plant in the family Iridaceae. In 2005, based on molecular DNA sequence evidence, Belamcanda chinensis, the sole species in the genus Belamcanda, was transferred to the genus Iris and renamed Iris domestica.

## Care Guide
The Blackberry Lily, native to temperate East Asian grasslands and woodlands, prefers full sun to partial shade and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications. It thrives in average soil fertility, benefiting from occasional balanced fertilization during its active growth for robust health and blooming.

### Fertilizer
Average fertility. Growing in various soil types in its native range, it benefits from a light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
