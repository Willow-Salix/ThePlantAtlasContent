## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mecardonia Dianthera thrives in bright, open conditions with consistently moist soil, typical of its subtropical to tropical native wetlands and grasslands. Ensure it receives full to partial sun exposure and regular watering, especially during warm periods. Fertilize periodically to encourage vigorous growth and abundant flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from regular fertilization during the growing season due to its vigorous growth habit. A balanced liquid fertilizer applied every 2-4 weeks or a slow-release granular fertilizer can support healthy foliage and flowering.
