| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Louisiana, Texas), Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America (e.g., Brazil, Argentina) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Wet/Moist, found in open, disturbed sites, wetlands, and grasslands. |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun to partial sun. Benefits from bright, direct light, especially in its native open habitats where it is not shaded by a dense canopy. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, reflecting its native habitat in wet places and moist grasslands with ample rainfall. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during active growth. |

## Care Guide
Mecardonia Dianthera thrives in bright, open conditions with consistently moist soil, typical of its subtropical to tropical native wetlands and grasslands. Ensure it receives full to partial sun exposure and regular watering, especially during warm periods. Fertilize periodically to encourage vigorous growth and abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular fertilization during the growing season due to its vigorous growth habit. A balanced liquid fertilizer applied every 2-4 weeks or a slow-release granular fertilizer can support healthy foliage and flowering.
