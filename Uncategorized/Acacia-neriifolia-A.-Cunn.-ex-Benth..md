## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia (southeastern Queensland and northeastern New South Wales) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Temperate Dry Woodlands and Sclerophyll Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring full sun for optimal growth and flowering, reflecting its natural exposure in open woodlands. |
| **Watering** | Tolerates drought once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its adaptation to dry periods in its native habitat. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Acacia neriifolia, also known as the oleander wattle, silver wattle or pechy wattle, is a tree in the genus Acacia native to north eastern Australia. It is common in the Moonbi Ranges.

## Care Guide
This Australian native thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions, requiring full sun to partial shade. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions to mimic its drought-tolerant nature. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it's adapted to low-nutrient soils and fixes its own nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required, especially for established plants, due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume and adaptation to nutrient-poor Australian soils. If absolutely necessary, use a very low-phosphorus native plant fertilizer.
