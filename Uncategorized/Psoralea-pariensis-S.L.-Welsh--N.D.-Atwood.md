## Introduction
Psoralea is a genus in the legume family (Fabaceae) with 121 species of shrubs, trees, and herbs native to southern and eastern Africa, ranging from Kenya to South Africa. In South Africa they are commonly referred to as fountainbush (English); fonteinbos, bloukeur, or penwortel (Afrikaans); and umHlonishwa (Zulu).

## Care Guide
This high desert native requires full sun exposure and is exceptionally drought-tolerant, needing infrequent deep watering. It thrives in lean, well-draining soil and has very low fertilizer requirements, making it an ideal choice for arid or xeriscape gardens.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. Native to nutrient-poor desert soils, it does not benefit from rich fertilization. If growth is exceptionally poor, a very light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer might be applied once in spring.
