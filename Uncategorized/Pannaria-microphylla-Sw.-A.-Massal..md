## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Humid temperate and subtropical forests across the Northern Hemisphere, including Eastern North America, parts of Europe, and the Caribbean. |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; typically found in shaded or partially shaded understories or on tree trunks. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and occasional direct wetting (e.g., misting or rainfall); very sensitive to desiccation and dry air. |

## Introduction
Pannaria is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Pannariaceae. These lichens form leaf-like, scaly, or crusty patches that typically arrange themselves in loose rosettes on tree bark in humid forests. Most species partner with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, though some contain green algae instead. The genus was established in 1828 and now includes about 80 recognized species found worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in consistently high humidity and low to medium indirect light, mimicking its native humid forest environment. Avoid traditional watering and fertilization, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and precipitation, making it highly sensitive to dry conditions and external chemicals.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed; sensitive to pollutants and nutrient enrichment, deriving nutrients from atmospheric deposition.
