## Care Guide
Donnell's Hornwort flourishes in consistently moist, humid environments with indirect low to medium light, mimicking its natural habitat on damp forest floors. It requires very little to no fertilization and must not be allowed to dry out to ensure its survival.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. If used, apply a very diluted liquid fertilizer extremely sparingly, as hornworts are sensitive to nutrient overload.
