## Introduction
Sparganium (bur-reed) is a genus of flowering plants, described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753. It is widespread in  wet areas in temperate regions of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The plants are perennial marsh plants that can grow to 3.5 m (depending on the species), with epicene flowers.
It was previously placed alone in the family Sparganiaceae. Sparganium is closely related to the Typhaceae and the APG III system (2009) includes Sparganium in that family. It has been determined from phylogenetic analysis to be the closest living relative of the genus Typha (cat-tail).

## Care Guide
As a temperate aquatic plant, it requires full sun and constant submersion or saturated soil. It flourishes in nutrient-rich sediments, mimicking its native wetland environment, and benefits from a moderate to high nutrient supply.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high, thrives in rich organic sediments
