## Introduction
Gaillardia  (common name blanket flower) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, native to North and South America. It was named after Maître Gaillard de Charentonneau, an 18th-century French magistrate who was an enthusiastic botanist. The common name may refer to the resemblance of the inflorescence to the brightly patterned blankets made by Native Americans, or to the ability of wild taxa to blanket the ground with colonies. Many cultivars have been bred for ornamental use.

## Care Guide
This Blanketflower thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its native southeastern US coastal plain habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and avoid over-fertilizing to encourage abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its native habitat. Excessive fertilization can reduce flowering.
