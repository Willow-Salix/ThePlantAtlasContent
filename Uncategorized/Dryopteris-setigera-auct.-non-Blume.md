## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across the temperate and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America (e.g., Canada, USA), Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest (specifically montane and subalpine coniferous or mixed forests) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to partial shade; prefers filtered light or deep shade. Avoid direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil is crucial, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Dryopteris expansa, the alpine buckler fern, northern buckler-fern or spreading wood fern, is a species of perennial fern native to cool temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, south at high altitudes in mountains to Spain and Greece in southern Europe, to Japan in eastern Asia, and to central California in North America. It prefers cool, moist mixed or evergreen forests and rock crevices on alpine slopes, often growing on rotting logs and tree stumps and rocky slopes. It is characteristically riparian in nature, and is especially associated with stream banks.

## Care Guide
This fern thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions, mimicking its native forest floor habitat. Ensure consistently moist, well-drained soil and protect it from direct sunlight. Feed lightly with a balanced fertilizer or enrich the soil with organic matter to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or enrichment with organic matter like compost, especially during the growing season.
