## 🌱 Overview
Hedera, commonly called ivy (plural ivies), is a genus of 12–15 species of evergreen climbing or ground-creeping woody plants in the family Araliaceae, native to Western Europe, Central Europe, Southern Europe, Macaronesia, northwestern Africa and across central-southern Asia east to Japan and Taiwan. Several species are cultivated as climbing ornamentals, and the name ivy especially denotes common ivy (Hedera helix), known in North America as "English ivy", which is frequently planted to clothe brick walls.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Colchis Ivy thrives in a cool, humid environment with consistent soil moisture and protection from harsh direct sunlight. Mimic its native forest understory habitat by providing partial to full shade and regular watering to keep the soil consistently moist. Fertilize sparingly during active growth to support its robust foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer. Less is needed in richer soils or for mature plants.
