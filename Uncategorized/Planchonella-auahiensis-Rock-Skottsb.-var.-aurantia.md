## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (Maui, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe, Hawaiʻi) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry to Mesic Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun to partial shade, especially appreciating bright, direct light for several hours a day, mirroring its exposure in open forest and rocky slopes. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out significantly between waterings. It is tolerant of drier periods once established, reflecting its native dry to mesic forest habitat. |

## Introduction
Planchonella is a genus of flowering trees in the gutta-percha family, Sapotaceae. Named in honour of Jules Émile Planchon, it was described by Jean Baptiste Louis Pierre. It contains around 110 mainly tropical species, which range from Pakistan through Southeast Asia and New Guinea to northern and eastern Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands. The genus is included in the larger genus Pouteria by some authorities, hence species such as Planchonella australis are also known as Pouteria australis.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native flourishes in bright conditions, requiring full to partial sun and a watering regimen where soil dries between applications. Emulate its tropical dry to mesic forest origins by providing a diluted, balanced fertilizer during warmer growth periods.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer applied every 4-6 weeks during its active growing season (spring and summer).
