## Introduction
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## Care Guide
The San Luis Obispo Manzanita is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub adapted to the Mediterranean climate of California's central coast. It thrives in full sun and requires minimal to no watering once established, preferring lean, well-draining soils. This plant is low-maintenance and well-suited for xeriscaping in similar climatic zones.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; naturally thrives in lean, well-draining soils typical of chaparral environments. Avoid rich fertilization.
