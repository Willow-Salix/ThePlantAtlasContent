## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, including eastern Canada and the northeastern/midwestern United States. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Filtered light to partial shade, mimicking its natural habitat on tree trunks and branches within a forest canopy or understory. Avoid intense direct sun. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and regular moisture from misting or rain, allowing for periods of drying between hydration. It relies on atmospheric moisture and does not tolerate constant wetness or standing water. |

## Introduction
Platismatia is genus of medium to large foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. The genus is widespread and contains 11 species. They resemble many other genera of foliose lichens in the Parmeliaceae, particularly Parmotrema, Cetrelia, and Asahinea.  Most species are found in forests  on the trunks and branches of conifer trees, although some species grow on rocks.
Species of Platismatia can be used to produce an orange-brown, yellow-brown, or brown dye, and at least one species was traditionally used to dye wool in Europe.

## Care Guide
Tuckerman's Ragged Lichen thrives in cool to temperate, humid environments with good air circulation and filtered light. It requires regular atmospheric moisture from misting or high humidity, allowing for periods of drying, and should never be fertilized as it obtains nutrients from the air and rain.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens absorb nutrients directly from the air and rainwater, and traditional fertilizers can be harmful.
