## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mojave Desert, southwestern United States (primarily California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Arid Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires maximum direct sunlight for healthy growth, typically 6-8+ hours per day. |
| **Watering** | Very low; adapted to drought conditions. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Yucca brevifolia (also known as the Joshua tree, yucca palm, tree yucca, and palm tree yucca) is a plant species belonging to the genus Yucca. It is tree-like in habit, which is reflected in its common names.
This monocotyledonous tree is native to the arid Southwestern United States (specifically California, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada), and northwestern Mexico. It is confined mostly to the Mojave Desert between 400 and 1,800 m (1,300 and 5,900 ft) elevation. It thrives in the open grasslands of Queen Valley and Lost Horse Valley in Joshua Tree National Park. Other regions with a large population of the trees can be found northeast of Kingman, Arizona, in Mohave County; and along U.S. 93 just south of the community of Meadview, Arizona, a route which has been designated the Joshua Tree Parkway of Arizona. The trees are also abundant in Saddleback Butte State Park 135 kilometres (85 miles) north of Downtown Los Angeles in Los Angeles County's Antelope Valley. The common name, Joshua tree, is derived from Christian iconography.

## Care Guide
The Joshua Tree thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid desert, requiring extensive full sun exposure and extremely infrequent watering, especially during dormancy. It prefers well-draining, nutrient-poor soil and should be protected from excessive moisture to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none; thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
