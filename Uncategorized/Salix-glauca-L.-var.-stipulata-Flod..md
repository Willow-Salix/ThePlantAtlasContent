*Salix glauca L. var. stipulata Flod.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions across North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska, Greenland) and Eurasia (e.g., Scandinavia, Siberia) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. As a plant of open, treeless or low-shrub landscapes, it thrives with significant direct sunlight exposure during the growing season. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil. Native to environments with meltwater and poorly draining soils (often due to permafrost), it prefers constantly damp or even boggy conditions. |

## Care Guide
This willow thrives in cold, open environments, requiring full to partial sun exposure. It needs consistently moist to wet soil conditions, mimicking its native boggy or meltwater-rich habitats. Fertilization should be low to moderate, as it's adapted to nutrient-poor tundra soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor. Fertilize sparingly, perhaps once annually in spring with a balanced, slow-release formula if growth is desired or the soil is exceptionally lean.
