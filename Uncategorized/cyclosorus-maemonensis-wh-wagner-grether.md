## 🌱 Overview
Cyclosorus is a genus of ferns in the family Thelypteridaceae, subfamily Thelypteridoideae, in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Other sources sink Cyclosorus into a very broadly defined genus Thelypteris, or expand the genus to include other genera which PPG I keeps separate. Thus the online Flora of China suggests there are about 250 species compared to the two species suggested in PPG I.
There are also fossil species known from the Eocene of South China and the Quaternary of Australia.
The genus is named from the Greek, referring to the circular sori.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical fern thrives in a consistently moist, high-humidity environment, mimicking its native rainforest floor. Provide indirect bright light or partial shade, and fertilize sparingly during active growth to support its lush foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength during the active growing season (spring and summer).
