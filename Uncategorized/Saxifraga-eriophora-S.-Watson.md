## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically mountainous regions of California, Oregon, and Nevada, USA |
| **Climate** | Alpine/Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in high light exposure found on open, rocky slopes. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during active growth, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Requires excellent drainage, characteristic of rocky alpine environments. Drought tolerant once established. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
This alpine perennial thrives in full sun and very well-drained, rocky soil, mirroring its native mountainous habitat. Provide moderate water during its active growing season, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and fertilize sparingly, if at all.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Native alpine soils are typically lean. If growth is poor, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in early spring.
