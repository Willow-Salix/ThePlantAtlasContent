## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Bingen Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soil, mirroring its native Columbia River Gorge shrubland habitat. It requires moderate watering in spring, tolerating dry conditions and reduced watering in summer once established. Avoid nitrogen-rich fertilizers due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen; avoid nitrogen-rich fertilizers. Prefers lean, well-draining soil.
