## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | High-altitude regions of East Africa, including countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. |
| **Climate** | Afro-alpine and Afromontane zones, characterized by cool temperatures, frequent mist or fog, high rainfall, and well-drained soils. |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring bright light but appreciating some protection from the most intense midday sun, especially in warmer lowland gardens, due to its high-altitude origin. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil but excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot, mimicking the frequent rainfall and fast drainage of its mountainous habitat. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
This high-altitude species needs cool, bright conditions with protection from intense afternoon sun. Ensure consistently moist, well-drained soil and provide moderate fertilization during active growth to mimic its nutrient-rich, misty mountain home.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate feeding during its active growth period, reflecting the fertile, often volcanic soils of its native environment. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied periodically.
