## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Western Europe (e.g., British Isles, Scandinavia), Central Europe (montane areas), and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forest, often with oceanic influence, characterized by high humidity and moderate temperatures. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate, indirect light. Prefers dappled shade, mimicking its natural habitat on tree bark beneath a forest canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and consistent moisture. Regular misting is crucial, and it should be kept moist but not waterlogged. Mimic frequent rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pertusaria is a large genus of warty crustose lichens in the Pertusariaceae family. The fruiting bodies are usually modified apothecia that immersed in warts on the main body (thallus) with small holes for the spores to emerge, similar to ostioles, or are fully above and lecanorine (spore bearing discs surrounded by a ring of tissue similar to the tissue of the thallus.  Members of the genus are commonly called wart lichens.
The widespread genus contains over 500 species.
Classification in the large genus relies heavily on thallus chemistry to distinguish and classify species, some of which differ only in the presence or absence of a single secondary chemical. Lichexanthone, norlichexanthone, and their chlorinated derivatives are common in this genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stenhammar's Pore Lichen thrives in environments with high humidity and consistent moisture, preferring low to moderate indirect light or dappled shade. Avoid direct sun and any form of fertilization, as these lichens are self-sufficient and sensitive to external nutrients. Ensure a constantly humid atmosphere for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilization is necessary or recommended. Lichens derive nutrients from the air, rain, and their substrate, and are sensitive to excess nutrients.
