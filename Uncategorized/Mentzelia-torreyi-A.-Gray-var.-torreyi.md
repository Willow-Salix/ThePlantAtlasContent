## Care Guide
Torrey's blazingstar thrives in full sun and dry conditions, mimicking its native arid scrubland and desert environments. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and has very low fertilizer needs, preferring lean soil.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean to poor soils typical of arid regions. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, perhaps once a year with a very dilute all-purpose fertilizer in spring.
