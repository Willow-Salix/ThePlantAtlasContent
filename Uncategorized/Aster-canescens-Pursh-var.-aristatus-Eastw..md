## Care Guide
This hardy aster requires full sun and is very drought-tolerant once established, thriving in lean, well-draining soils. Mimic its semi-arid montane origins by providing ample light and infrequent deep watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; typically thrives in average to poor, well-draining soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is sufficient if soil is particularly lean.
