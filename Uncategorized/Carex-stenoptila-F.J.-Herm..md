## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
The Riverbank Sedge thrives in consistently wet conditions and prefers full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native streambank habitat. Ensure its soil never dries out, providing ample water regularly. Fertilizer needs are minimal, a light annual feeding is usually sufficient.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is generally sufficient, or none if planted in rich, organic soil.
