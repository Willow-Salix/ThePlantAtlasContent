## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in temperate, humid conditions with moderate to bright indirect light. Provide consistent high humidity and moisture through misting, allowing for dry periods. No fertilizer is required as it obtains nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is needed. Lichens absorb nutrients directly from the atmosphere and their substrate.
