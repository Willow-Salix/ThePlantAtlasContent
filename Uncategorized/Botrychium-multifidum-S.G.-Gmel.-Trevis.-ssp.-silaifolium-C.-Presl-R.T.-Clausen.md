## Introduction
Botrychium is a genus of ferns, seedless vascular plants in the family Ophioglossaceae. Botrychium species are known as moonworts. They are small, with fleshy roots, and reproduce by spores shed into the air. One part of the leaf, the trophophore, is sterile and fernlike; the other, the sporophore, is fertile and carries the clusters of sporangia or spore cases.  Some species only occasionally emerge above ground and gain most of their nourishment from an association with mycorrhizal fungi.

## Care Guide
This fern thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, replicating its native forest and meadow habitats. Ensure consistent soil moisture and well-draining, organic-rich soil for optimal growth, protecting it from harsh direct sunlight.

### Fertilizer
Requires humus-rich soil. Fertilize lightly with an organic-rich, balanced fertilizer during the growing season, if necessary.
