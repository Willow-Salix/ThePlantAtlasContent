# Arctic Aster
### *Eurybia sibirica (L.) G.L. Nesom*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Subarctic and Arctic regions of North America (Alaska, Canada) and Eurasia (Siberia, Russian Far East). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Boreal Forest margins. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Sun. This plant is adapted to open, treeless landscapes with high light exposure during the short arctic summer. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture. The soil should be kept moist but must have excellent drainage, especially in warmer climates, to prevent root rot. It tolerates boggy conditions from snowmelt in spring but dislikes standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
The common name arctic aster may refer to two different plants of the genus Eurybia:

Eurybia merita, the subalpine aster
Eurybia sibirica, the Siberian aster

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Arctic Aster thrives in cool climates with full to partial sun exposure, mimicking its open native habitat. It requires consistently moist but very well-drained soil, as it adapted to conditions of melting snow and ice in well-drained rocky areas. Fertilization should be kept minimal due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor tundra and boreal soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native tundra and boreal soils are typically poor in nutrients. Over-fertilization can be detrimental; a light annual application of a balanced fertilizer or compost in spring is sufficient if the soil is particularly lean.
