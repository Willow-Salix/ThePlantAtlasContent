## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, mimicking its arid native habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and fertilize infrequently during its active growth period to ensure optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer applied once or twice during the spring/summer growing season.
