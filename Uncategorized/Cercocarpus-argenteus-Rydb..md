## Introduction
Cercocarpus, commonly known as mountain mahogany, is a small genus of at least nine species of nitrogen-fixing flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae. They are native to the western United States and northern Mexico, where they grow in chaparral and semidesert habitats and climates, often at high altitudes. Several are found in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion.

 
The classification of Cercocarpus within the Rosaceae has been unclear. The genus has been placed in the subfamily Rosoideae, but is now placed in subfamily Dryadoideae.
Members of the genus are deciduous shrubs or small trees, typically reaching heights of 3–6 m (9–18 ft) tall, but exceptionally up to 13 m (40 ft) high. C. montanus usually remains under 1 m (3 ft) high because of incessant grazing by elk and deer.
The name is derived from the Greek words κέρκος (kerkos), meaning "tail" and καρπός (karpos), meaning "fruit".  It refers to the tail-like plume on the fruits.

## Care Guide
This hardy shrub flourishes in full sun and well-draining, often rocky soils, characteristic of its native arid and montane environments. It exhibits extreme drought tolerance once mature, necessitating infrequent watering and very little supplemental fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; generally thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and requires minimal to no fertilization.
