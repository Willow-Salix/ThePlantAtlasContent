## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (specifically Transverse and Peninsular Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, bright conditions, typical of its native grasslands and chaparral habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growing season (winter to spring) to mimic native rainfall. Requires significantly reduced or no water during its summer dormancy period. |

## Introduction
Brodiaea , also known by the common name cluster-lilies, is a monocot genus of flowering plants.
One school of thought places the genus in the family Themidaceae, while another school of thought places it in the subfamily Brodiaeoideae of the family Asparagaceae.  The USDA Plants Database still classifies the genus Brodiaea in the family Liliaceae.
Brodiaea species occur along the Pacific Coast region of North America, from British Columbia throughout California into the Baja California Peninsula. They are especially common in northern California.

## Care Guide
Lemon's Brodiaea, a Californian native, flourishes in full to partial sun, typical of its Mediterranean climate origin. Water moderately during its winter to spring active growth, then allow it to go dormant and dry out completely in the summer. A light, balanced fertilizer during the growing season will support its health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer during active growth in late winter or early spring is generally sufficient.
