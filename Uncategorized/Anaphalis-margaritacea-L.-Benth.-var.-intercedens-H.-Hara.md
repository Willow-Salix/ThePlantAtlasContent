## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Asia (e.g., Japan, Korea, parts of China) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest/Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open, well-lit environments, similar to its natural habitat in meadows and forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil; tolerates some drought once established. Avoid waterlogging, which is uncommon in its open native habitats. |

## Introduction
Anaphalis is a genus of herbaceous and woody flowering plants within the family Asteraceae, whose members are commonly known by the name pearl or pearly everlasting. There are around 110 species with the vast majority being native to central and southern Asia. There is one species native to North America that is fairly well known  and popular in cultivation, namely the western pearly everlasting (Anaphalis margaritacea).
The name probably derives from the common practice of drying the flowers and stems for decorations through winter months.  This plant was used extensively by Native Americans for a variety of medicinal purposes.
Two of the species, A. javanica and A. longifolia can be found on mountainsides on the Island of Java in Indonesia. Anaphalis javanica, also known as the Javanese Edelweiss, is currently an endangered species.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in temperate climates, preferring full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and tolerates average fertility, making it a relatively low-maintenance option for gardeners.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It naturally grows in average to even poor soils, often in disturbed areas; excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth rather than robust flowering.
