## Introduction
Linanthus is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the phlox family Polemoniaceae. The species are found in western North America and in Chile, with the greatest diversity in California.
The stems are erect, with multiple branches arising directly from the base, and grow 2–15 cm tall. The leaves are stem-like (cauline) and opposite, with shapes ranging from entire to palmately lobed, the 3-9 lobes being linear to lanceolate or spatulate. Flowers have a tubular calyx, and the corolla may be funnel- or bell-shaped, or salverform.
The genus name is from the Greek for "flax flower", since the flowers superficially resemble those of flax. The genus has recently been split, with many of the species formerly included now transferred to the genus Leptosiphon (Jepson Manual).

## Care Guide
This annual wildflower thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its native California Mediterranean climate. It requires consistent moisture during its spring growing and blooming period but is drought-tolerant once established or as it approaches dormancy. Fertilization is generally not required in average garden soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; adapted to nutrient-poor or lean soils.
