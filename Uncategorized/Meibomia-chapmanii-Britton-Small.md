## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Dry Pinelands and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. This plant is accustomed to the open, often sunny conditions found in pine flatwoods and dry pinelands. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Allow the topsoil to dry out completely between waterings. Its native sandy soils promote quick drainage, and it's adapted to tolerate periods of drought once established. |

## Introduction
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. Species are distributed widely – from Quebec to northern Argentina in the Americas, across northern and southern tropical Africa, in the southern Arabian Peninsula, in Myanmar and Thailand, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia.

## Care Guide
Chapman's Ticktrefoil, native to the subtropical dry pinelands of the southeastern U.S., thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil. Allow the soil to dry between waterings, and keep fertilization minimal, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor, sandy habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in less fertile, sandy soils; a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer application once in spring may be beneficial in very poor soils, but heavy fertilization is generally unnecessary.
