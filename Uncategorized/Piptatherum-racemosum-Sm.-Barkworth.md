| **Native Origin** | Widespread across Europe, North Africa, and West Asia, including countries such as France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Morocco, and parts of the Middle East. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodlands and Grasslands, often found in open woods, dry hillsides, rocky slopes, and scrubland, with influences from Mediterranean climate zones. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. This plant thrives in bright, open conditions, reflecting its habitat in open woodlands and dry slopes. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant once established due to its native habitat on dry, stony ground. |

## Care Guide
This temperate grass thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil, tolerating dry conditions well once established. It needs moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs, making it a robust and relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to less fertile soils, a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer application once in spring is typically sufficient, or only if growth seems poor.
