## Introduction
Eriophorum (cottongrass, cotton-grass or cottonsedge) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae, the sedge family. They are found in the cool temperate, alpine, and Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, primarily in the middle latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia.

## Care Guide
This plant requires consistently wet, boggy conditions and thrives in full sun, reflecting its native alpine and boreal bog habitats. Due to the naturally nutrient-poor soils of its origin, it has very low fertilizer requirements. Mimic a cool, open, and permanently waterlogged environment for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low; native bog soils are typically nutrient-poor and acidic, so minimal to no fertilization is needed.
