## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Illinois Flatsedge requires full sun and consistently wet soil to mimic its native sandy wetland and prairie habitats. Ensure the soil never dries out, providing frequent watering or keeping the plant in a consistently moist environment. Fertilization needs are low to moderate, responding well to occasional feeding during its active growth phase.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As it often grows in sandy, sometimes disturbed soils, it's adapted to lower nutrient levels. A balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season if soil is poor.
