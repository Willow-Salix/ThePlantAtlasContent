## 🌱 Overview
Dalea  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as prairie clover or indigo bush. Its name honors English apothecary Samuel Dale (1659–1739). They are native to the Western hemisphere, where they are distributed from Canada to Argentina. Nearly half of the known species are endemic to Mexico. Two species of Dalea (Dalea ornata and Dalea searlsiae) have been considered for rangeland restoration.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant prefers a sunny location and is highly drought-tolerant, needing minimal water once established. It thrives in lean soils and does not require fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. Excessive fertilizer, especially nitrogen, can harm growth and flowering.
