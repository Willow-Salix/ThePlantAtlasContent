| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Pacific Northwest, California) and disjunct populations in parts of South America (Chile, Argentina). |

## Care Guide
Menzies' anacolia moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded environments, mirroring its native forest floor habitat. Ensure constant humidity and keep the growing medium moist without being waterlogged. Protect from direct sun and avoid using fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required; mosses are not heavy feeders and can be harmed by excessive nutrients.
