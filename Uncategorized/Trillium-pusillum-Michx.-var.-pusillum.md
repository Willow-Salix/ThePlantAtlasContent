## Care Guide
The Dwarf Wakerobin thrives in consistently moist, organic, well-drained soil under dappled to full shade, especially in cooler spring temperatures. Ensure ample moisture during its active growth cycle in spring and protect it from intense afternoon sun to mimic its native woodland environment.

### Fertilizer
Prefers moderately rich, organic soil. Benefit from amendments like compost or leaf mold rather than strong synthetic fertilizers.
