## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in cool, high-altitude conditions, requiring full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is adapted to lean soils, so fertilizer should be kept to a minimum. Mimicking its native rocky, moist meadow habitat is key for successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. This plant is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor alpine soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
