## Care Guide
The Spoonleaf Sundew thrives in open, sunny conditions with consistently wet, acidic soil. Use only pure water like distilled or rainwater, and avoid any fertilizers, as the plant obtains its nutrients from captured insects.

### Fertilizer
None. Fertilizers can harm or kill the plant as they are adapted to nutrient-poor soils and get their nutrients from captured insects.
