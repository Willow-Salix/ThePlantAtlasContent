## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal and arctic-alpine regions, including North America (Alaska, Canada, Rocky Mountains), Greenland, Europe (Scandinavian mountains, Alps), and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun; while alpine regions are often exposed, this lichen grows among mosses, suggesting a need to prevent desiccation from intense, direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistent high humidity and frequent misting are essential, mimicking its native environment of snowmelt and frequent precipitation. Avoid waterlogging, but maintain dampness. |

## Introduction
Solorina is a genus of 10 species of lichenized fungi in the family Peltigeraceae. The genus was first described by the Swedish botanist Erik Acharius in 1808. Members of the genus are commonly called socket lichens.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, humid conditions with bright, indirect light, much like its native alpine and arctic habitats. Maintaining high environmental moisture through frequent misting is crucial, and traditional fertilizers should be avoided as they can be detrimental. The key is to replicate a stable, cool, and damp microclimate.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required or recommended; lichens absorb all necessary nutrients directly from the air and precipitation, and conventional fertilizers can be detrimental.
