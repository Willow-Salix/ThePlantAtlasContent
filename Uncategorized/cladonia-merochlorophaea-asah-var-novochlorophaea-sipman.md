## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | High-altitude tropical montane regions, including parts of Central and South America (e.g., Costa Rica) and Southeast Asia (e.g., Papua New Guinea). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Montane Cloud Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect bright light to partial shade. Protection from intense direct sunlight is crucial due to the constant cloud cover in its native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high humidity and a moist but well-drained substrate, mimicking the frequent fog and rainfall of cloud forests. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations.
Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).
Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.
Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dunes, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.
Larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes continuella, feed on Cladonia species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, highly humid environments typical of tropical montane cloud forests. Provide indirect bright light, ensure constant high humidity through misting or enclosure, and keep the substrate consistently moist but never waterlogged. Fertilizers are not needed and should be avoided.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens are self-sufficient, deriving necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate; traditional fertilizers are harmful.
