## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, and British Columbia |
| **Climate** | Temperate Seasonal Wetlands (Vernal Pools) within Mediterranean and semi-arid climate zones |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, unshaded vernal pools and grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Requires abundant water during its active growing period (late winter to spring), mimicking the saturated conditions of vernal pools. Must experience a dry dormancy period in summer. |

## Introduction
Plagiobothrys is a genus of flowering plants known commonly as popcorn flowers. These are small herbaceous plants which bear tiny white or yellow flowers. Their fruits are nutlets. Although these plants are found predominantly in North America and South America, five species are known from Australia. Of the approximately 65 species described, more than 15 are endemic to California.

## Care Guide
Greene's Popcornflower thrives in full sun with a specific watering regimen: abundant moisture during its winter/spring growing phase, followed by a dry summer dormancy. It adapts well to low to moderate nutrient soils, reflecting its native vernal pool habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient requirements; prefers lean to moderately rich soils, adapted to the naturally varying conditions of seasonal wetlands. Light, balanced fertilization is sufficient if cultivated.
