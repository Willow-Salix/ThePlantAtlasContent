## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Washington and Eastern Oregon, particularly the Columbia River Gorge region |
| **Climate** | Temperate Arid Shrubland / Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal flowering and health. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid any standing water or consistently moist conditions. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This Penstemon thrives in dry, sunny conditions, mimicking its native arid shrubland habitat. Provide full sun and well-draining, lean soil, watering infrequently to ensure drought-tolerant growth. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization to maintain a healthy and floriferous plant.

### Fertilizer
Prefers lean to poor soil and generally does not require fertilizer. Over-fertilization can lead to weak, leggy growth and reduced flowering. If growth is very weak, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring may be considered.
