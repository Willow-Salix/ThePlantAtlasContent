## Care Guide
Onslow Panicgrass thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist soil, reflecting its native humid subtropical bog and pineland habitats. It is not a heavy feeder, preferring low to moderate fertility, and adapts well to various soil types as long as moisture levels are maintained.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in less fertile sandy or boggy soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, or none if soil is naturally rich.
