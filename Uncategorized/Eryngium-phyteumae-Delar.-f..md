## Introduction
Eryngium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. There are about 250 species. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, with centres of diversity in the western Mediterranean, South America and Mexico. Common names include eryngo and sea holly (though not to be confused with true hollies, of the genus Ilex).
These are annual and perennial herbs with hairless and usually spiny leaves. The dome-shaped umbels of steely blue or white flowers have whorls of spiny basal bracts. European and Asian species tend to be native to dry, rocky and coastal areas, and the American species are native to often damp grasslands.
In the language of flowers, they represent admiration.

## Care Guide
Provide partial shade and consistent, moderate moisture while ensuring excellent soil drainage. It prefers lean to moderately fertile soil and protection from the harshest afternoon sun, reflecting its native montane woodland habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in lean to moderately fertile soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost once in spring is sufficient.
