## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Asia (primarily India and Sri Lanka) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Semi-Arid |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure, ideally full sun to very bright indirect light, mimicking its natural open and exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It's adapted to distinct dry periods and is highly susceptible to root rot from overwatering. |

## Care Guide
To care for Mottled Spurge, provide abundant bright light or full sun, consistent with its tropical semi-arid origins. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to fully dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. Use a well-draining cactus mix and fertilize minimally during the growing season.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization, as it grows in naturally lean, rocky soils. A diluted succulent/cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer) is sufficient.
