## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Bog/Wet Savanna |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to very bright indirect light, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sun daily for optimal growth and dew production. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently wet at all times, preferably using the tray method with 1-2 inches of distilled water, rainwater, or reverse osmosis water. Never allow the soil to dry out, and avoid tap water due to mineral content. |

## 🌱 Overview
Drosera, which is  commonly known as the sundews, is one of the largest genera of carnivorous plants, with at least 194 species. These members of the family Droseraceae lure, capture, and digest insects using stalked mucilaginous glands covering their leaf surfaces. The insects are used to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which the plants grow. Various species, which vary greatly in size and form, are native to every continent except Antarctica.
Charles Darwin performed much of the early research into Drosera, engaging in a long series of experiments with Drosera rotundifolia, which were the first to confirm carnivory in plants.  In an 1860 letter, Darwin wrote, "...at the present moment, I care more about Drosera than the origin of all the species in the world".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tracy's Sundew thrives in full sun and constantly saturated, nutrient-poor conditions. Always use pure water (distilled, RO, or rainwater) to keep its soil wet, and never apply traditional fertilizers. Provide high humidity and bright light for robust growth and vibrant color.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required or recommended. This carnivorous plant obtains necessary nutrients from captured insects. Standard fertilizers will harm or kill the plant.
