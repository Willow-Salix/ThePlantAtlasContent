## Introduction
Crataegus coccinea, the scarlet hawthorn, is a species of hawthorn around which there is considerable confusion because the name has been misapplied for a long time. It has been shown to be the same as C. pedicellata, and under the rules of botanical nomenclature, the older name (C. coccinea) should be used.

## Care Guide
This temperate plant prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil, tolerating brief dry periods once established. It requires minimal fertilization, thriving best with a light application in spring if necessary. Mimicking its native open woodland environment ensures healthy growth and vibrant fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; generally not a heavy feeder. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring, especially in poor soils.
