## Care Guide
This rare Hawaiian plant thrives in high humidity and consistent moisture, requiring dappled or indirect light as an understory species. Maintain evenly moist, well-draining soil and provide a diluted, balanced fertilizer during its growing season to mimic its native tropical rainforest environment.

### Fertilizer
Light, balanced liquid fertilizer applied monthly at half strength during active growth; natural forest soils are not excessively rich but benefit from regular nutrient cycling.
