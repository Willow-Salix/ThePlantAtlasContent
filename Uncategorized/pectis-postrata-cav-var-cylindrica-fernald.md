## 🌱 Overview
Pectis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1759.
The name is derived from the Latin word pecten, meaning "comb." It refers to the marginally-bristled leaves or the pappus form.  These plants vary in appearance but they usually bear yellow daisy-like flower heads. Members of the genus are known generally as cinchweeds (current usage) or chinchweeds (older name).
They are native to the Americas, including the West Indies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pectis prostrata var. cylindrica thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, mirroring its origins in open, dry tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-maintenance plant that is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal fertilization, making it suitable for exposed garden spots.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal, as it often thrives in nutrient-poor, disturbed soils. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be given once or twice during the growing season if desired.
