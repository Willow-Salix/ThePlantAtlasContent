## Introduction
Rorippa is a globally distributed genus in the family Brassicaceae, with species occurring on all continents except for Antarctica. Rorippa species are natively distributed in the Northern Hemisphere through Eurasia and North America, and dispersed into the Southern Hemisphere through long-distance dispersal. Rorippa species are annual to perennial herbs, usually with yellow flowers and a peppery flavour. They are known commonly as yellowcresses.

## Care Guide
To successfully cultivate Modoc Yellowcress, provide a location with full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil remains consistently wet or saturated, mimicking its native wetland conditions. It thrives in average to moderately fertile soil and will struggle in dry or heavily nutrient-depleted environments.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from soils with average to good organic content, typical of wetland environments. Light, balanced fertilization might be beneficial if soil appears poor.
