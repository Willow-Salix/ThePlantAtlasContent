## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Florida, USA |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Dicerandra is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family. Dicerandra comprises 11 species: six perennial and five annual species. The perennials have narrow ranges in Central Florida with small population sizes and only occur on ancient dune ridges along the Lake Wales Ridge or the Atlantic Coastal Ridge; the annual species occur more broadly on sandhill habitats to the north. The perennials’ habitat has been severely fragmented due to human development over the past century. As a result, all perennial species except one are listed as federally endangered. Annual species of the clade have large ranges when compared to perennial members, with distributions of annuals ranging for hundreds of miles from the Panhandle of Florida to southeastern Georgia, with the exception of Dicerandra radfordiana which is endemic to two sites along the Altamaha river. The genus is characterized by hornlike spurs on their anthers.
The phylogenetics of this genus have been studied before; first by Robin Huck in 1987, who described Section Dicerandra, which includes all species with standard-lobed corollas and exserted stamens, and section Lecontea which includes D. odoratissima and D. radfordiana that have cucullate-lobed corolla species with inserted stamens. Subsequent studies by plant systematists at the University of Florida have confirmed these sections, in addition to discovering a potential chloroplast capture event in Dicerandra immaculata var savannarum.

## Care Guide
Scrub Balm is a drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and very well-drained, sandy soil. Mimicking its native arid scrubland, it requires infrequent, deep watering and minimal to no fertilizer for optimal health. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. If desired, a very diluted, slow-release formula can be applied sparingly once a year.
