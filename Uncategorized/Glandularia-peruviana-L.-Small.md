## Introduction
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## Care Guide
Peruvian Mock Vervain thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native subtropical grasslands. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and apply a balanced fertilizer sparingly during the growing period for best results.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer lightly during the active growing season, or not at all if soil is fertile.
