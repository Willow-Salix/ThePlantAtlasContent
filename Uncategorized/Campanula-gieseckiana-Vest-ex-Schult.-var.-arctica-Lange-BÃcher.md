## Introduction
Campanula () is the type genus of the Campanulaceae family of flowering plants. Campanula are commonly known as bellflowers and take both their common and scientific names from the bell-shaped flowers—campanula is Latin for "little bell".
The genus includes over 500 species and several subspecies, distributed across the temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with centers of diversity in the Mediterranean region, Balkans, Caucasus and mountains of western Asia. The range also extends into mountains in tropical regions of Asia and Africa.

The species include annual, biennial and perennial plants, and vary in habit from dwarf arctic and alpine species under 5 cm high, to large temperate grassland and woodland species growing to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall.

## Care Guide
This arctic bellflower thrives in open, cool environments, preferring full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil during its active growth. It requires minimal fertilization, adapting to the lean conditions of its native tundra habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilizer; thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils characteristic of tundra environments.
