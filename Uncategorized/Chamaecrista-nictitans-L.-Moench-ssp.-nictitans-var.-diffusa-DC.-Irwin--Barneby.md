## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America, parts of South America |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Grasslands and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the top few inches of soil to dry out between waterings. While somewhat drought-tolerant, it thrives with consistent moisture during its active growing season. |

## Introduction
Chamaecrista is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Members of the genus are commonly known as sensitive pea. Several species are capable of rapid plant movement. Unlike the related genera Cassia and Senna, members of Chamaecrista form root nodules.
Chamaecrista has 367 species, with a wide distribution – the Americas from Minnesota to northern Argentina, sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Iran, the Indian Subcontinent, Indochina, China, Korea, Japan, Malesia, New Guinea, and Australia.

## Care Guide
The Sensitive Partridge Pea thrives in full sun, mimicking its native open habitats. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and has low fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Replicating these conditions will ensure robust growth and its characteristic sensitive foliage.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; as a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. Over-fertilization can be detrimental. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in very poor soils, but is often unnecessary.
