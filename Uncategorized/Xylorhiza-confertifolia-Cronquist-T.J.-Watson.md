## Care Guide
The Henrieville woodyaster is a resilient desert plant that thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering. It is best grown in lean, well-draining soil and has minimal fertilizer needs, reflecting its adaptation to arid scrubland environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Its native desert soils are typically lean, so it does not require rich fertilization. If necessary, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring.
