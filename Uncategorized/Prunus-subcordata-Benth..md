## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (California, Oregon, Nevada) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Foothills |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, ideally preferring full sun for optimal growth and fruit production. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is needed during its establishment phase; once mature, it is highly drought-tolerant, adapted to dry summers, and primarily needs moisture during cooler, wetter seasons. |

## Introduction
Prunus is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs from the family Rosaceae. The genus includes plums, cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots and almonds (collectively stonefruit). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, being native to the temperate regions of North America, the neotropics of South America, and temperate and tropical regions of Eurasia and Africa, There are about 340 accepted species as of March 2024.
Many members of the genus are widely cultivated for their sweet, fleshy fruit and for decorative purposes of their flowers. Prunus fruit are drupes, or stone fruits. The fleshy mesocarp surrounding the endocarp is edible while the endocarp itself forms a hard, inedible shell called the pyrena ("stone" or "pit"). This shell encloses the seed (or "kernel"), which is edible in some species (such as sweet almonds), but poisonous in many others (such as apricot kernels). Besides being eaten off the hand, most Prunus fruit  are also commonly used in processing, such as jam production, canning, drying, and the seeds for roasting.

The Klamath Plum thrives in full sun to partial shade within a Mediterranean climate, requiring moderate water when young but becoming highly drought-tolerant upon maturity. It prefers lean, well-draining soil and typically needs little to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Thrives in lean, well-draining soils and typically does not require supplemental fertilization once established.
