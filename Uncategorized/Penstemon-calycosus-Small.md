## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
Longsepal Beardtongue, a native of temperate forests, thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistent moisture in well-drained soil. It prefers lean to average soil conditions, with minimal fertilization being sufficient for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in lean to average soil. Over-fertilization can lead to lush foliage at the expense of flowers.
