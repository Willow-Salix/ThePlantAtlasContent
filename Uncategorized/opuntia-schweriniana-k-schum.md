## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Prickly Pear demands full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its arid native habitat. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and use fertilizer very sparingly. Protect from frost as it is not cold-hardy.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Apply a diluted, balanced cactus-specific fertilizer sparingly once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
