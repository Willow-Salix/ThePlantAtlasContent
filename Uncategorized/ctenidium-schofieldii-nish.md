## 🧤 Care Instructions
Schofield's ctenidium moss thrives in conditions that mimic its native temperate rainforest habitat: consistent moisture, high humidity, and very low, indirect light. It requires minimal to no fertilization, preferring stable and humid environments to prevent drying out.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed; mosses are low-nutrient plants and can be harmed by excessive fertilization.
