## 🌱 Overview
Cordylanthus (lit. 'club-flower'), commonly known as bird's beaks, is a genus of parasitic plants in the broomrape family, Orobanchaceae. These western North American natives are sparse, weedy-looking annuals with long branching erect stems and little foliage, and many bear bird's-beak–shaped flowers. They are remarkable among the broomrapes for growing at searing temperatures in arid climates.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and requires infrequent watering, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum due to its hemiparasitic nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none; many species are hemiparasitic, deriving nutrients from host plants and may be sensitive to excessive external fertilization.
