## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America (e.g., Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Rainforest / Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Very low to indirect bright light; thrives in deep shade or under a dense canopy, avoiding direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and constant moisture. Keep substrate damp but not waterlogged, mimicking frequent rainfall and persistent mist. Frequent misting is beneficial. |

## Introduction
Plagiochila is a large, common, and widespread genus of liverworts in the order Jungermanniales. It is a member of the family  Plagiochilaceae within that order. There may be anywhere from 500 to 1300 species, most of them from the tropics; the exact number is still under revision.

## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical montane rainforest. Provide very low light, extremely high humidity, and consistently moist (but not waterlogged) substrate. Fertilization needs are minimal, relying on ambient moisture and substrate decomposition.

### Fertilizer
Very low. If desired, use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/8 strength) very infrequently, perhaps once or twice a year, or rely on nutrient-rich water/substrate decomposition.
