## Care Guide
This desert-adapted perennial thrives in full sun and very well-draining, poor soils, reflecting its arid scrubland origins. It requires very little water once established and benefits from minimal to no fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry climates.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization needed. Thrives in lean, well-draining soils characteristic of its native habitat, which are typically low in organic matter.
