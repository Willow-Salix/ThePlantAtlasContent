## 🌱 Overview
Nabalus is a genus of Asian and North American flowering plants in the tribe Cichorieae within the family Asteraceae.
Nabalus is now considered the correct name for a group of plants in North America that were formerly considered to be members of Prenanthes, and were included in that genus in the Flora of North America treatment.  Common names for the genus include "rattlesnake root" and "white lettuce." The latter reflects its close relationship to lettuce (Lactuca sativa) but having flowers that are whitish or purplish-white in some species.  Many (perhaps all) of the species are monocarpic perennials, in which an individual plant may live for multiple years in a vegetative condition but then will die after flowering and fruiting.
