## Care Guide
This moss thrives in a cool, humid environment with consistent moisture and low to indirect light. Ensure the substrate remains damp but not waterlogged, and humidity levels are kept high. Fertilization is generally not required.

### Fertilizer
Very low; typically no fertilization is required. Mosses are adapted to nutrient-poor environments, so supplemental feeding can be detrimental.
