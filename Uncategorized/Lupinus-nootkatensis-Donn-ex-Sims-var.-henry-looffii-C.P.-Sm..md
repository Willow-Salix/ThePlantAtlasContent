## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Nootka Lupine thrives in cool, temperate maritime or subalpine climates, requiring full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it needs minimal fertilizer, focusing on phosphorus and potassium if soil is particularly poor.

### Fertilizer
Low nitrogen; as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches soil. May benefit from phosphorus and potassium in very poor soils, but generally requires minimal feeding.
