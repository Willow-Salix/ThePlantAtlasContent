| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest, Arid/Semi-Arid Scrubland, and Subtropical Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open, exposed areas. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, then water deeply. Reduce watering in cooler months, mimicking natural dry seasons. |

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and requires well-drained soil, tolerating drought conditions once established. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. Fertilization is minimal, making it a low-maintenance choice for warm, sunny environments.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. An occasional application of a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer once a month during the active growing season is sufficient, as it naturally grows in lean soils.
