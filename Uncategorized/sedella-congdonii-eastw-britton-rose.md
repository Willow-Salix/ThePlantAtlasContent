## 🧤 Care Instructions
Congdon's Mock Stonecrop requires significant sun exposure and extremely infrequent watering, mimicking its arid Mediterranean shrubland origins. It thrives in lean, well-drained soils and does not need regular fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant adapted to tough conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in nutrient-poor soils, typical of serpentine barrens. Fertilization is generally not needed, or only a very dilute, balanced feed once a year for potted plants.
