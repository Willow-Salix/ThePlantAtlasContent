## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (primarily United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate (Humid Continental to Humid Subtropical) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Naturally found in open woods, forest edges, and along stream banks, indicating it tolerates a range but performs best with at least 6 hours of direct sun for optimal flowering and foliage color. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, particularly when establishing. Established plants exhibit good drought tolerance but benefit from supplemental watering during extended dry spells, reflecting its presence near stream banks as well as drier rocky slopes. |

## Introduction
Physocarpus, commonly called ninebark, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae, native to North America (most species) and northeastern Asia (one species). 
The genus name Physocarpus comes from the Greek for "bladder fruit", referring to the inflated fruits of some species. The common name 'ninebark' refers to the peeling bark of mature branches, which comes away in strips.

## Care Guide
Atlantic Ninebark is a robust, low-maintenance shrub well-suited to temperate climates. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moderate, consistent watering, though established plants are quite drought-tolerant. Fertilization is rarely necessary, making it an easy-care addition to most landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low. Generally not required for healthy growth in average to rich soils. A light application of a balanced slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial for plants in very poor soils or to encourage more vigorous growth.
