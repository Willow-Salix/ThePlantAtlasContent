## 🌱 Overview
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rattan's Cryptantha thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native arid scrubland and chaparral environment. Water infrequently once established, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly, and avoid excessive fertilization to mimic its natural, lean growing conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils; fertilizer is generally not required or should be applied very sparingly, if at all, in early spring.
