## Introduction
Chrysopsis (golden asters) are plants in the family Asteraceae native to the southern and eastern United States. All the species are found in Florida, although some are found in other states as well.
These are annual and perennial herbs bearing daisy-like flower heads with yellow disc florets and usually yellow ray florets. Some species formerly classified in this genus are now included in other genera: Heterotheca, Pityopsis, Stenotus, Ionactis, Aster, Eucephalus, Erigeron, Machaeranthera, Croptilon, Xanthisma, Oclemena, Bradburia, Oxypappus, Arnica, and Helichrysopsis.
Golden asters are often used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Schinia petulans (which feeds exclusively on C. subulata).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its origins in open grasslands and arid regions. It requires minimal watering once established and generally does not need fertilization, preferring leaner soil conditions. Its drought tolerance makes it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny spots.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; thrives in lean, well-draining soils and excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
