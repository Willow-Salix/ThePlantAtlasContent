## 🌱 Overview
Xanthoceras sorbifolium, the yellowhorn, shiny leaf yellowhorn, goldenhorn, or Chinese flowering chestnut, is a woody oil tree species in the family Sapindaceae, and the only species in the genus Xanthoceras. It is native to northern China in the provinces of Gansu, Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, Nei Monggol, Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Shandong. It is also cultivated in Russia, having been imported there since the 19th Century. The genus name Xanthoceras (which translates as "yellow horn") is considered to be the most basal member of the family Sapindaceae.  The specific epithet sorbifolium refers to the leaves, which resemble those of the distantly related rowans (Sorbus). It was originally spelled sorbifolia, but this is a grammatical error that was corrected to sorbifolium under the ICBN.
X. sorbifolium is an ancient tree species. It is said it can live up to 2,000 years. It is a sacred tree planted in temples in northern China, because there is no Ficus religiosa in the north. It is also used in traditional Chinese, Mongolian and Tibetan medicine. In Bencao Gangmu, it is called '天仙果 (Heavenly Fairy Fruit)'. Tenacious X. sorbifolium can grow in snow and drought like in the Gobi Desert. It has very high alimentaire value, medicinal value, ornamental value and ecological value. In cultivation in the UK, X. sorbifolium has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Yellowhorn thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, showcasing good drought tolerance once established. Water moderately, ensuring the soil dries between waterings, and keep fertilization to a minimum.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil is poor, but generally not a heavy feeder.
