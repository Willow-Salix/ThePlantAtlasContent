## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (primarily Sierra Nevada foothills and inner North Coast Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland / Dry Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers full sun for best flowering but tolerates some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; requires moderate water during establishment, then infrequent, deep watering only during extended dry periods, especially in summer. |

## Introduction
Calystegia (bindweed, false bindweed, or morning glory) is a genus of about 25 species of flowering plants in the bindweed family Convolvulaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution in temperate and subtropical regions, but with half of the species endemic to California.  They are annual or herbaceous perennial twining vines growing 1–5 m tall, with spirally arranged leaves. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, 3–10 cm diameter, white or pink, with (in most species) a sometimes inflated basal epicalyx.
The genus bears much similarity to a related genus Convolvulus, and is sometimes combined with it; it is distinguished primarily by the pollen being smooth, and in the ovary being unilocular.
Some of the species, notably Calystegia sepium and C. silvatica, are problematic weeds, which can swamp other more valuable plants by climbing over them, but some are also deliberately grown for their attractive flowers.
Calystegia species are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Bedellia somnulentella (recorded on C. sepium) and small angle shades.
The name is derived from two Greek words κάλυξ (kálux) "cup", and στέγη (stégē) "a covering", meaning "covering cup", this refers to the large bracts that cover the sepals.

## Care Guide
This resilient perennial thrives in full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native Mediterranean climate. Once established, it requires minimal watering, primarily during prolonged dry spells, and generally needs no supplemental fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; it is adapted to nutrient-poor or moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization can promote excessive foliage at the expense of blooms.
