## Introduction
Teucrium is a cosmopolitan genus of flowering plants in the mint family Lamiaceae, commonly known as germanders. Plants in this genus are perennial herbs or shrubs, with branches that are more or less square in cross-section, leaves arranged in opposite pairs, and flowers arranged in thyrses, the corolla with mostly white to cream-coloured, lobed petals.

## Care Guide
Lacy Germander thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid environments. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or low-maintenance gardens. Avoid overwatering and excessive fertilization to ensure its health.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements. A light, balanced fertilizer once annually in spring is sufficient if grown in poor soil, otherwise it thrives with minimal nutrients.
