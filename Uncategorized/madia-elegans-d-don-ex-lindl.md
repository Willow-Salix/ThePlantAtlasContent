## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (specifically California and Oregon, USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, often in open grasslands and chaparral) |
| **☀️ Light** | Thrives in full sun to partial shade. Full sun encourages denser growth and more abundant flowering, while partial shade can be beneficial in regions with intense afternoon heat. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture during its active growth period from late winter through spring. Once flowering begins and temperatures rise, it can tolerate drier conditions, mimicking its native habitat's dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Madia is a genus of annual or perennial usually aromatic herbs with yellow flowers, in the tribe Madieae within the family Asteraceae.
They are sometimes known as tarweeds. The species in this genus are native to western North America and southwestern South America. The name Madia is derived from native Chilean name ("Madi") for one of the members of the genus (Madia sativa). Tarweeds derive their common name from the intense stickiness of the plant.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Common Madia thrives in a Mediterranean climate with full sun to partial shade, requiring consistent moisture during its spring growth and bloom. It is adapted to drier conditions in summer and performs best with minimal fertilization due to its preference for nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often found in serpentine. Generally does not require heavy fertilization; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer at the beginning of its growing season is sufficient if soil is exceptionally poor.
