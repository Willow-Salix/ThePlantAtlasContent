## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern North America (including parts of eastern Canada and the northeastern United States) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coniferous and Mixed Deciduous-Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Extremely low light / Deep Shade (no direct sun), as it does not photosynthesize. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking damp, undisturbed forest floor conditions. |

## Introduction
Monotropsis is a small genus of just two flowering plants in the family Ericaceae, Monotropsis odorata and Monotropsis reynoldsiae. They are native to the southeastern United States.
Like all members of the subfamily called the monotropes, the species in Monotropsis do not contain chlorophyll. They are myco-heterotrophs, getting its food through parasitism upon fungi rather than photosynthesis. These fungi form a mycorrhiza with nearby tree species.

## Care Guide
Cultivation of Monotropsis lehmaniae outside its native habitat is virtually impossible due to its obligate mycoheterotrophic nature, requiring specific fungal and tree partners for survival. It thrives in undisturbed temperate forest floors with deep shade and consistently moist, well-drained, humus-rich soil. Standard horticultural care methods are inapplicable for its survival.

### Fertilizer
None. This plant is an obligate mycoheterotroph, relying entirely on specific fungal symbionts for all nutrients; traditional fertilizers are ineffective and potentially harmful.
