## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, encompassing Southern Europe (e.g., Italy, Spain, France, Greece), North Africa (e.g., Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia), and parts of Western Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. Thrives in open, exposed areas, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to mimic its native scrubland and grassland environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Requires regular watering during its active growing season (cooler months from autumn to spring), allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, demanding minimal to no water during hot, dry summer dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Aira is a genus of Old World plants in the grass family, native to western and southern Europe, central and southwest Asia, plus Africa.
The common name, shared with the similar related genera Deschampsia and Koeleria, is hair-grass, from the very slender leaves and stems. The species typically occur on dry, sandy sites, and grow to 20–40 cm tall.
Several species are grown as ornamental plants for their very delicate airy seed heads, used in dried flower arrangements.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Aira cupaniana is a Mediterranean annual grass that flourishes in full sun and well-draining soil. It needs moderate watering during its cool-season growth, becoming very drought-tolerant as it enters summer dormancy. This plant requires minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor or moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring is generally sufficient, though often not necessary in average garden soils.
