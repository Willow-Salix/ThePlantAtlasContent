## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pellaea intermedia thrives in conditions mimicking its native rocky habitats in Southern Africa, preferring partial shade and well-draining soil. It requires consistent moisture during its growing season but tolerates slight drying between waterings, and benefits from light, infrequent fertilization to support its moderate growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. Use a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once every 2-3 months) during the growing season; avoid over-fertilization.
