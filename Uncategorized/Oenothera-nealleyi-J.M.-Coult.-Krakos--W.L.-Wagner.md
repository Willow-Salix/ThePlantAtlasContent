## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, tolerating drought conditions with minimal watering. Fertilization is generally not necessary, as it is accustomed to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soil; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
