## Introduction
Phemeranthus (fameflower) is a genus of flowering plants in the miner's lettuce family, Montiaceae, native to the Americas. It was formerly placed in Portulacaceae. The name is derived from the Greek words εφήμερος (ephemeros), meaning "living for one day," and ἄνθος (anthos), meaning "flower." Common names for the various species are often fame flower, rock rose, rock pink, and sand pink.

## Care Guide
The Largeflower Fameflower thrives in bright, sunny conditions and well-draining soil, mimicking its native open prairies and rocky glades. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions. Fertilization needs are minimal, as it is accustomed to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring or diluted liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season is sufficient.
