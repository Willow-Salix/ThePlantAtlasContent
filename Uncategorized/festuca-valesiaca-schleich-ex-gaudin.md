## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Western Asia, and Central Asia (Eurasian steppes including countries like Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Kazakhstan). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Steppe Climate (Continental Steppe), characterized by hot, dry summers and cold winters, with low to moderate annual precipitation. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. As a grass of open grasslands and steppes, it is adapted to direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Low. This plant is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during dormant periods or cooler months. |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Volga Fescue is a resilient, drought-tolerant grass ideal for dry, sunny landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained, infertile soils, requiring minimal watering and fertilization once established. This makes it an excellent low-maintenance choice for xeriscaping or naturalized areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. It thrives in lean, poor to moderately fertile soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. Over-fertilizing can be detrimental; a light, balanced fertilizer might be applied sparingly if growth appears weak.
