## 🌱 Overview
Linum (flax) is a genus of approximately 200 species in the flowering plant family Linaceae. They are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the world. The genus includes the common flax (L. usitatissimum), the bast fibre of which is used to produce linen and the seeds to produce linseed oil.

The flowers of most species are blue or yellow, rarely red, white, or pink, and some are heterostylous. There is an average of 6 to 10 seeds per boll.
Linum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the cabbage moth, the nutmeg, the setaceous Hebrew character and Coleophora striolatella, which feeds exclusively on Linum narbonense.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cleveland's Rock Flax thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, adapted to the hot, dry summers and wet winters of its native Mediterranean climate. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering once established, and needs minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization should be avoided; a light, balanced feed once in spring is sufficient.
