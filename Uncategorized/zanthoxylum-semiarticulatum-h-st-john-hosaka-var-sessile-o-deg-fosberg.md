## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian native thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical dry to mesic forest habitat, preferring bright light exposure. It requires consistent watering during its active growing season, with the soil allowed to dry between applications, and significantly reduced watering during dormancy. Provide moderate fertilization for optimal growth and health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied during its active growing season (spring and summer).
