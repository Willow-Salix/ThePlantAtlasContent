## Care Guide
This Chilean lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean to semi-arid habitat. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and has low fertilizer needs due to its natural nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen in the soil. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. A light application of a balanced or phosphorus-rich fertilizer in poor soils might be beneficial, but often not necessary.
