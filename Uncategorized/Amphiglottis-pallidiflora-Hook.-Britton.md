## Introduction
Epidendrum , abbreviated Epi in the horticultural trade, is a large neotropical genus of the orchid family. With more than 1,500 species,  some authors describe it as a mega-genus. The genus name (from Greek επί, epi and δένδρον, dendron, "upon trees") refers to its epiphytic growth habit.
When Carl Linnaeus named this genus in 1763, he included in this genus all the epiphytic orchids known to him. Although few of these orchids are still included in the genus Epidendrum, some species of Epidendrum are nevertheless not epiphytic.

## Care Guide
This orchid requires conditions similar to its native humid montane forest environment. Provide bright, indirect light, consistent moisture with excellent drainage, and very high humidity. Feed regularly during its active growing season to encourage healthy development and blooming.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, balanced orchid fertilizer applied regularly during active growth, typically at half strength.
