## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical/Warm Temperate Wetland and Moist Pine Savanna |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, reflecting its habitat in open marshes and savannas. |
| **💧 Water** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native bog and marsh environments, possibly even standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tracy's beaksedge thrives in full to partial sun and demands consistently wet soil, ideally mimicking a bog or marsh environment. It is accustomed to nutrient-poor, acidic soils, so fertilization should be minimal or avoided entirely. Overall, maintain high moisture levels and adequate sunlight for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; native soils in bogs and pine savannas are typically nutrient-poor and acidic, suggesting minimal or no fertilization is needed.
