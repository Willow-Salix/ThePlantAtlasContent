| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun (prefers full sun, especially in cooler, higher altitude environments) |

## Introduction
Androsace, commonly known as rock jasmine, is a genus of flowering plants in the  family Primulaceae, second only to Primula in the number of species. It is predominantly Arctic–alpine, with many species in the Himalayas (where the genus originated), the mountains of central Asia, the Caucasus, and the southern and central European mountain systems, particularly the Alps and the Pyrenees.
Plants of this genus are sometimes known as rock jasmines or fairy candelabras, and are widely cultivated for their dense cushions covered in white or pink flowers. There are roughly 110 species.
These plants have small entire or toothed leaves which form a basal rosette.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in sunny locations with excellent drainage, mimicking its native alpine and subalpine environments. Provide low to moderate water and avoid rich soils or excessive fertilization to ensure optimal growth and prevent rot.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils. Over-fertilization can harm the plant.
