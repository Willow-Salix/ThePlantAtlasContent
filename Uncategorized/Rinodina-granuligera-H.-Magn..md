| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to indirect light; protected from direct, intense sun, mimicking forest understory or canopy shade. |

## Introduction
Rinodina is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 265 species. It is hypothesized that a few saxicolous species common to dry regions of western North America, southern Europe, North Africa and central Asia may date back 240 million years to the Middle Triassic.

## Care Guide
This corticolous lichen thrives in cool, humid environments characteristic of temperate to boreal forests. Provide moderate, indirect light and ensure high ambient humidity with consistent atmospheric moisture, avoiding direct sun and chemical fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
Not typically required. Lichens absorb nutrients from the atmosphere and their substrate; traditional chemical fertilizers can be harmful.
