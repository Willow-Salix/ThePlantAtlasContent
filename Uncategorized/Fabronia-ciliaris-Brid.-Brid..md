# Fabronia Moss

*Fabronia ciliaris (Brid.) Brid.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate to subtropical regions globally, including parts of North America (e.g., Southeastern USA), Europe, Asia, and Africa, extending to parts of Central and South America. |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate to Subtropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade, or filtered light. As an epiphytic moss, it naturally grows under the canopy, avoiding direct, intense sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture and high humidity are crucial. Requires frequent misting or placement in an enclosed, humid environment. While it needs moisture, ensure good air circulation to prevent stagnant conditions. |

## Care Guide
Fabronia moss thrives in consistently moist, highly humid conditions and prefers partial to full shade, mimicking its native forest understory habitat. Regular misting is essential to maintain surface moisture, and direct sunlight should be avoided. Due to its low nutrient needs, fertilization should be minimal or absent.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses generally have low nutrient demands and can be sensitive to high fertilizer concentrations. If used, apply a very diluted, specialized moss or orchid fertilizer infrequently.
