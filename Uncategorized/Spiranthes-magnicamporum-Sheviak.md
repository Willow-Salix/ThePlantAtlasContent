## Introduction
Spiranthes is a genus of orchids in the subfamily Orchidoideae. They are known commonly as ladies tresses, ladies'-tresses, or lady's tresses. The genus is distributed in the Americas, Eurasia, and Australia. The genus name Spiranthes is derived from the Greek speira ("coil") and anthos ("flower"), and was inspired by the spirally arranged inflorescence.

## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during its active growth period. Mimicking its native prairie habitat, it benefits from low to moderate, infrequent fertilization, ensuring proper drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly during the active growing season (e.g., once a month at half strength). Avoid over-fertilization.
