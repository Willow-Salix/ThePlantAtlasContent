## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Himalayan region (including parts of India, Nepal, Bhutan, China, Pakistan) and adjacent temperate areas of Southwest China. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Mountain / Subalpine Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) for optimal flowering and fruiting, but can tolerate partial shade (4-6 hours direct sunlight), especially in warmer regions. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate, consistent watering, particularly during dry spells and while establishing. Established trees are somewhat drought-tolerant but perform best with regular moisture; ensure well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
This Himalayan variety of Siberian Crab Apple thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its temperate mountain origins. Provide moderate, consistent watering and annual fertilization to encourage robust growth, abundant flowering, and fruiting.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from an annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, especially in nutrient-poor soils. Healthy organic matter in well-drained soil is often sufficient.
