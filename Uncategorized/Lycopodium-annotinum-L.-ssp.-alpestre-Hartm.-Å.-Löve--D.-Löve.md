| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine zones |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun, avoiding intense direct afternoon sun in warmer climates. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage; mimics frequent rainfall and snowmelt of its native high-altitude habitat. |

## Introduction
Diphasiastrum alpinum, the alpine clubmoss, is a species of clubmoss. This plant is a glaucous scale-leaved perennial pteridophyte. In Finland, the spores are produced June to September. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his Flora Lapponica, 1737, from specimens obtained in Finland.

## Care Guide
This alpine clubmoss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and well-drained acidic soil, mirroring its high-altitude native habitat. It prefers bright indirect light to partial sun, avoiding harsh direct sun. Fertilize sparingly to mimic nutrient-poor alpine conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. Light fertilization with a dilute liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season; alpine soils are typically nutrient-poor.
