## Introduction
Leptogium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Collemataceae. It has about 110 species. Species formerly classified under Leptogium have since been divided among the genera Leptogium, Pseudoleptogium, and Scytinium. Leptogium lichens are predominantly found on tree bark or soil, often among mosses, and sometimes on rocks in moist environments.

## Care Guide
Leptogium thrives in highly humid, shaded environments, mirroring its native forest habitats. It requires consistent moisture and no traditional fertilization, absorbing necessary nutrients directly from its surroundings, often found on bark or mossy rocks.

### Fertilizer
Not required; nutrients are absorbed directly from the atmosphere and rainwater
