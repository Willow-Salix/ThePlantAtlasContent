## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Europe (including British Isles and Mediterranean region), Western Asia, and North Africa |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grasslands and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, typically thriving in brighter, open conditions in its natural habitat. |
| **Watering** | Regularly, ensuring the soil dries slightly between waterings; it's adapted to moderate, consistent rainfall typical of temperate zones. |

## Introduction
Geranium is a genus of 422 species of annual, biennial, and perennial plants that are commonly known as geraniums or cranesbills. They are found throughout the temperate regions of the world and the mountains of the tropics, with the greatest diversity in the eastern part of the Mediterranean region.
The palmately cleft leaves are broadly circular in form. The flowers have five petals and are coloured white, pink, purple, or blue, often with distinctive veining. Geraniums will grow in any soil as long as it is not waterlogged. Propagation is by semiripe cuttings in summer, by seed, or by division in autumn or spring.
Geraniums are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, ghost moth, and mouse moth. At least several species of Geranium are gynodioecious. The species Geranium viscosissimum (sticky geranium) is considered to be protocarnivorous.

## Care Guide
Thriving in temperate regions, Longstalk Cranesbill prefers full sun to partial shade and regular watering, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between sessions. It is adaptable to various soil types and only requires low to moderate fertilization during its active growth. Mimicking its native open woodland and grassland environment will promote vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, diluted fertilizer can be applied during its active growth period, as it often grows in less nutrient-rich soils.
