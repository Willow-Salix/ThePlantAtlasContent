## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska, northern USA) and northern Eurasia (e.g., Russia, Scandinavia), including Greenland. |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest/Taiga and Arctic Tundra, specifically found in permanently wet habitats such as fens, bogs, and marshes. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun; can tolerate more direct sun if consistently cool and wet. |
| **Watering** | Constantly moist to wet; the substrate should never be allowed to dry out, mimicking its native waterlogged habitats. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in consistently wet and cool environments, replicating its native boreal and arctic bog habitats. It requires constant moisture and bright indirect to partial sun, with very minimal or no fertilization needed to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; its native bog and fen habitats are typically nutrient-poor, and mosses are not heavy feeders.
