## Introduction
In Greek mythology, the name Chloris (; Greek Χλωρίς Chlōrís, from χλωρός chlōrós, meaning "greenish-yellow", "pale green", "pale", "pallid", or "fresh") appears in a variety of contexts. Some clearly refer to different characters; other stories may refer to the same Chloris, but disagree on details.

Chloris, a nymph loved by Zephyrus (West Wind).
Chloris, wife of Neleus, king of Pylos. It is, however, not always clear whether she or the below Chloris is mentioned in this role.
Chloris, one of the Niobids.
Chloris, daughter of Orchomenus, married the seer Ampyx (son of Elatus or Titairon), with whom she had a child Mopsus who also became a renowned seer and would later join the Argonauts. The Argonautica Orphica calls her by a different name, Aregonis. In some accounts, she mothered Mopsus by Zeus.

## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, reflecting its native subtropical grassland habitat. It prefers well-drained soil and requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance option for warm climates.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once or twice during the active growing season is sufficient, especially in poorer soils.
