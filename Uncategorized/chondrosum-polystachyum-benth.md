## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native arid environment. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization due to its adaptation to lean soil conditions. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs. Adapted to lean soils, it generally does not require heavy fertilization; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial but is often not necessary.
