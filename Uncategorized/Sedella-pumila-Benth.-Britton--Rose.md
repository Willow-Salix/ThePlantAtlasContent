## Care Guide
This annual succulent thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, replicating its native Mediterranean environment. Water infrequently, ensuring the soil dries completely between waterings, especially minimizing moisture during hot, dry periods. Fertilization requirements are low, supporting its natural growth in lean, rocky conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in lean soils; a highly diluted, balanced succulent fertilizer can be applied once or twice during its active growing season, but is often not necessary.
