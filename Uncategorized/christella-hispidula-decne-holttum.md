## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical fern requires consistent moisture, high humidity, and protection from direct sunlight to mimic its native rainforest floor environment. Provide well-draining soil and feed lightly during the growing season for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding is adequate. Use a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once a month) during the active growing season, or incorporate organic matter into the soil.
