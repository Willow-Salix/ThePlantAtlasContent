## Care Guide
Santa Barbara Milkvetch thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid scrubland environment. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen, should be avoided. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in very poor soils, but is often not necessary.
