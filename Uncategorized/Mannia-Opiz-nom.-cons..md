## Care Guide
Mannia liverworts thrive in cool, humid environments with consistent substrate moisture and indirect light. Mimic their natural habitat of shaded, damp rocks or soil by providing frequent watering without waterlogging, maintaining high humidity, and avoiding direct sun. Fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful to these sensitive plants.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. As bryophytes, they are adapted to nutrient-poor environments; high nutrient levels can be detrimental.
