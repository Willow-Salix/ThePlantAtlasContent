## 🧤 Care Instructions
This succulent-like plant is well-adapted to hot, dry conditions and requires minimal care. Provide ample sunlight and infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between waterings. Fertilization is rarely necessary, reflecting its native habitat in lean, arid soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; a diluted balanced fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season, but it generally thrives in nutrient-poor soils.
