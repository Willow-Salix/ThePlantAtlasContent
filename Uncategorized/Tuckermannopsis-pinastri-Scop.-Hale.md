## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to filtered light; avoid intense, direct sunlight as it can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and consistent moisture from misting or ambient precipitation; sensitive to prolonged dry periods. |

## Introduction
Tuckermannopsis is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. The genus contains about twelve species of foliose (leafy) to somewhat fruticose (bushy) lichens with brownish or greenish thalli. Species in Tuckermannopsis are found primarily in temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with centres of diversity in western North America and East Asia. Members of the genus are distinguished by their cetrarioid growth form, with reproductive structures largely restricted to the margins of the lobes, and the absence of usnic acid in their upper cortex.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with filtered light, mimicking its natural habitat on conifer bark in temperate to boreal forests. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture and clean air, as it absorbs nutrients directly from its surroundings rather than through soil or conventional fertilization.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required, as lichens absorb nutrients directly from the air and rainwater.
