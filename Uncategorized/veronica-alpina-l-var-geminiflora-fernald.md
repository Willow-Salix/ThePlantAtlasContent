## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine variety thrives in high light with consistently moist, well-drained soil, replicating its subarctic mountain habitat. Ensure good drainage and avoid rich fertilizers to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. It naturally grows in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. If growth is weak, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial.
