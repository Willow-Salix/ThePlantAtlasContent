## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives by replicating its native Mediterranean cycle: abundant moisture and good light during its active spring growth, followed by a dry, dormant period through the hot summer. Ensure well-draining soil and avoid any watering during summer dormancy to prevent rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost tea can be beneficial once in early spring at the start of active growth. Avoid heavy feeding.
