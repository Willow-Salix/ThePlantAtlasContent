## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Fuzzy Sedge thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate European woodlands and meadows. Provide moderate to high light and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil. Fertilize moderately during its active growth period for best results.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization is sufficient. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring to early summer).
