## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northeastern California, specifically Modoc County |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun; requires open, unshaded exposure similar to its native dry flats and slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Low; drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry out between watering sessions to mimic its arid native rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fossil Hill Creek Bedstraw requires care that mimics its arid native scrubland habitat. Provide full sun exposure and infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely. It thrives in lean soil, so fertilize sparingly or not at all.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to lean, volcanic soils. Avoid heavy fertilization; a very light, balanced fertilizer application annually, if at all, is sufficient.
