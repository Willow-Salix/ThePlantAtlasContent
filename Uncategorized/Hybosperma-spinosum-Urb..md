# Hybosperma spinosum

*Hybosperma spinosum Urb.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hispaniola (Dominican Republic, Haiti) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade. It thrives in the understory of dense forests, preferring filtered light or indirect sun. |
| **Watering** | High. The soil should be kept consistently moist but well-draining, mimicking the frequent rainfall and high humidity of its native habitat. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely. |

## Care Guide
This tropical plant requires a consistently moist, humid environment with ample shade, mimicking its native forest understory. Ensure well-draining soil and avoid direct sunlight to prevent leaf scorch. Fertilize sparingly during warmer months for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to low. A balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength, applied monthly during the active growing season, would be suitable to supplement nutrients from its naturally rich, decomposing forest floor environment.
