## Care Guide
Pillow Bluet thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean to moderately fertile soil, mimicking its native rocky glade habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, preferring to dry out thoroughly between waterings. Avoid consistently wet or rich soils to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility. Prefers lean soils; over-fertilization can be detrimental. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring is optional.
