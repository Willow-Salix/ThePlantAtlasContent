## Care Guide
This wetland plant thrives in consistently wet conditions, mimicking its native habitat in the southeastern United States. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure the roots are always submerged in water or extremely moist soil. Moderate fertilization suitable for aquatic plants will support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Thrives in nutrient-rich wetland soils. Use a balanced aquatic plant fertilizer or ensure a rich organic substrate in its growing medium.
