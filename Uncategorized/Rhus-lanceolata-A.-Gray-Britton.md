## Introduction
Sumac or sumach ( S(H)OO-mak, UK also )—not to be confused with poison sumac—is any of the roughly 35 species of flowering plants in the genus Rhus (and related genera) of the cashew and mango tree family, Anacardiaceae. However, it is Rhus coriaria that is most commonly used for culinary purposes. Sumac is prized as a spice—especially in Iranian cuisine, and other Eastern cuisines—and used as a dye and holistic remedy. The plants grow in subtropical and temperate regions, on nearly every continent except Antarctica and South America.
Native to Persia, it holds cultural significance as a symbolic item on the Haft-sin table during Nowruz, the Persian New Year.

## Care Guide
Prairie Sumac is a hardy, low-maintenance plant best suited for full sun and well-drained, often poor soils. Its drought tolerance means it requires minimal watering once established, making it ideal for xeriscaping or naturalized areas. Avoid over-fertilization and consistently wet conditions to ensure its health.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally thrives in lean, poor soils and does not require regular fertilization. Excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
