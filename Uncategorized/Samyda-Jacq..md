## Care Guide
Samyda requires conditions similar to its native tropical moist forests, thriving in consistent moisture, high humidity, and bright, indirect light. Ensure well-draining soil and fertilize moderately during active growth to support its needs.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring to fall), reducing or stopping completely during winter dormancy.
