## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including northern North America, Europe, and Asia; commonly found in temperate, boreal, and arctic wetlands. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate to Arctic Peatlands and Boreal Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to bright indirect light; avoid intense, direct afternoon sun which can cause desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and a perpetually damp, acidic substrate. Regular misting and placement in a humid environment are essential, as lichens absorb moisture directly from the air. |

## Introduction
Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations.
Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).
Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.
Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dunes, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.
Larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes continuella, feed on Cladonia species.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with moderate light and nutrient-poor, acidic conditions. Crucial for its care is consistent high atmospheric moisture and a damp substrate, with no need for traditional fertilizers. Protect from intense sun and chemical exposure.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens are highly sensitive to excess nutrients and pollutants, thriving in naturally nutrient-poor environments.
