## Care Guide
Bearded Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. Provide regular water during its active growth phase in cooler months, then allow it to experience dry periods. This nitrogen-fixing plant requires minimal to no supplemental fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes its own nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
