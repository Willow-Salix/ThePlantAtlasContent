| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Georgia and South Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth and flowering; tolerates partial shade. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid consistently wet soil. |

## Introduction
Baptisia (wild indigo, false indigo) is a genus in the legume family, Fabaceae. They are flowering herbaceous perennial plants with pea-like flowers, followed by pods, which are sometimes inflated. They are native to woodland and grassland in eastern and southern North America. The species most commonly found in cultivation is B. australis.
Baptisia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the jaguar flower moth, Schinia jaguarina.

## Care Guide
This robust perennial thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, tolerating dry conditions once established. Being a nitrogen fixer, it requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for native plant gardens in humid subtropical climates.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed, especially avoiding high-nitrogen formulas due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil is very poor.
