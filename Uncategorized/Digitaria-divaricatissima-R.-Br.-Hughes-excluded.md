## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Australia (widespread in tropical and subtropical grasslands and open woodlands) |
| **Climate** | Dry Tropical/Subtropical Grasslands and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth, mimicking its open habitat. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Digitaria is a genus of plants in the grass family native to tropical and warm temperate regions but can occur in tropical, subtropical, and cooler temperate regions as well. Common names include crabgrass, finger-grass, and fonio. They are slender monocotyledonous annual and perennial lawn, pasture, and forage plants; some are often considered lawn pests. Digitus is the Latin word for "finger", and they are distinguished by the long, finger-like inflorescences they produce.

## Care Guide
This resilient Australian native grass thrives in full sun and is very drought-tolerant once established. It requires minimal watering and has low fertilizer needs, adapting well to conditions found in its natural grassland and open woodland habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or none if grown in reasonably fertile soil.
