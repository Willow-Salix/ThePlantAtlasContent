## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Eastern North America (primarily United States and parts of Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Prairie |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its native habitat in open prairies and clearings. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, especially when young or during prolonged dry periods. Established plants exhibit good drought tolerance due to their deep root systems, preferring consistently moist but not waterlogged soil. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rudbeckia () is a plant genus in the Asteraceae or composite family. Rudbeckia flowers feature a prominent, raised central disc in black, brown shades of green, and in-between tones, giving rise to their familiar common names of coneflowers and black-eyed-susans. All are native to North America, and many species are cultivated in gardens for their showy yellow or gold flower heads that bloom in mid to late summer.
The species are herbaceous, mostly perennial plants (some annual or biennial) growing to 0.5–3.0 m tall, with simple or branched stems. The leaves are spirally arranged, entire to deeply lobed, and 5–25 cm long. The flowers are produced in daisy-like inflorescences, with yellow or orange florets arranged in a prominent, cone-shaped head; "cone-shaped" because the ray florets tend to point out and down (are decumbent) as the flower head opens.
A large number of species have been proposed within Rudbeckia, but most are now regarded as synonyms of the limited list given below.
Several currently accepted species have several accepted varieties.  Some of them (for example the black-eyed susan, R. hirta), are popular garden flowers distinguished for their long flowering times.  Many cultivars of these species are known.
Rudbeckia is one of at least four genera within the flowering plant family Asteraceae whose members are commonly known as coneflowers; the others are Echinacea, 
Dracopis, and Ratibida.
Rudbeckia species are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera species including cabbage moths and dot moths.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This prairie native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring moderate watering to establish but becoming quite drought-tolerant once mature. It generally needs minimal fertilization, flourishing in conditions that mimic its rich grassland origins with open exposure.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average, well-draining soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil is poor.
