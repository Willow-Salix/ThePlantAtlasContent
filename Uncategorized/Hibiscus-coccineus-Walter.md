## Introduction
Hibiscus is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. The genus is quite large, comprising several hundred species that are native to warm temperate, subtropical and tropical regions throughout the world. Member species are renowned for their large, showy flowers and those species are commonly known simply as "hibiscus", or less widely known as rose mallow. The genus includes both annual and perennial herbaceous plants, as well as woody shrubs and small trees.
Several species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants, notably Hibiscus syriacus and Hibiscus × rosa-sinensis.

## Care Guide
The Scarlet Rosemallow thrives in full sun and consistently wet conditions, replicating its native wetland habitat. Ensure the soil never dries out, providing ample water, and feed regularly during the growing season to encourage its rapid, lush growth and abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderately rich soil. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring or a liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season to support its vigorous growth.
