## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Wet Meadow/Open Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers areas with good light but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering to keep soil consistently moist, especially during active growth and bloom periods. Tolerates some short dry spells once established but thrives with consistent moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dwarf Checkerbloom thrives in temperate wet meadows and open woodlands of California. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during its active growing season. Fertilize lightly in spring for optimal vigor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied in early spring can support vigorous growth, but it generally adapts to average soil fertility.
