## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in temperate to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly mountainous areas of Europe and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane to Alpine |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun/Full sun, as it typically grows on exposed rocks in open environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering, allowing for significant dry periods between moisture exposures (rain/snowmelt), mimicking natural atmospheric absorption and precipitation cycles. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in exposed, nutrient-poor, rocky environments with good air circulation. Provide full sun and allow for extended dry periods between infrequent moisture exposures, mirroring its native montane/alpine habitat. Do not fertilize, as it is sensitive to excess nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens derive nutrients from the air and rain; excess nutrients are detrimental.
