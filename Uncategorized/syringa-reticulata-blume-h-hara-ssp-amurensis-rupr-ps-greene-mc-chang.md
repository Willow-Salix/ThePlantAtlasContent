## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northeastern China, Russian Far East (Amur River region), Korea, and Hokkaido, Japan |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Thrives in full sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal flowering and growth. Tolerates light partial shade but may have reduced bloom. |
| **💧 Water** | Needs regular watering, especially when young or during prolonged dry periods, to establish a strong root system. Once mature, it is moderately drought-tolerant but benefits from consistent moisture during the growing season; ensure good drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Syringa is a genus of 12 currently recognized species of flowering woody plants in the olive family or Oleaceae called lilacs. These lilacs are native to woodland and scrub from southeastern Europe to eastern Asia, and widely and commonly cultivated in temperate areas elsewhere.
The genus is most closely related to Ligustrum (privet), classified with it in Oleaceae tribus Oleeae subtribus Ligustrinae.
Lilacs are used as food plants by the larvae of some moth species, including lilac leaf mining moth, privet hawk moth, copper underwing, scalloped oak and Svensson's copper underwing.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Amur Lilac is a robust temperate plant that flourishes in full sun with consistent moisture, especially during establishment. Once mature, it is quite resilient, requiring less frequent watering and minimal fertilization. Good drainage is essential to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally low-maintenance in terms of fertilization. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring or a layer of compost around the base is sufficient, particularly if soil is poor or growth is not vigorous.
