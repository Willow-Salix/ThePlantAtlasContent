## Care Guide
This species thrives in high humidity and low, indirect light conditions. Its specialized nature means it requires a consistently moist environment without the need for traditional fertilization. Care should focus on maintaining a humid, stable habitat.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no conventional fertilizer needed, as this is a lichenicolous fungus (growing on other lichens) that derives nutrients from its host or substrate.
