## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bastardsage thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soil, mirroring its native arid scrubland and desert habitat. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Avoid rich fertilizers, as it is adapted to low-nutrient conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; thrives in lean, well-draining soils typical of its native environment. Fertilize sparingly with a dilute, balanced fertilizer if growth seems stunted, or not at all in established plants.
