## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |

| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland/Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade. Avoid direct, intense sunlight, especially in warmer climates, as it can scorch leaves, preferring dappled light or deep shade as an understory plant. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil. Water regularly, particularly during dry periods, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. It thrives in naturally damp woodland conditions. |

## Care Guide
Eurasian Baneberry thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate woodland understory. It requires consistent shade or partial shade, along with continuously moist, well-drained soil. Provide moderate nutrients, ideally from organic matter, to support its growth without over-fertilizing.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from an annual application of organic compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially in poorer soils. Excessive fertilization is generally not needed.
