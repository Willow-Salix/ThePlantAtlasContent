## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Alaska, Northwestern Canada |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Boreal Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Sun (thrives in exposed, bright conditions) |
| **💧 Water** | Low to Moderate Watering (prefers well-drained soil; allow soil to dry out between waterings) |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Alaskan fescue thrives in cool, exposed conditions, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Provide full to partial sun and ensure well-drained soil, allowing it to dry out between moderate waterings. Minimal fertilization is needed for optimal growth, as it is adapted to lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low Fertilizer Needs (adapted to nutrient-poor alpine soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental)
