## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Canary Islands (Spain), specifically Gran Canaria and Tenerife. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Coastal Subtropical Dry (Mediterranean-like) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) to thrive, reflecting its natural habitat on exposed, sunny slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Water thoroughly when the top inch or two of soil is dry, then allow to dry out significantly before re-watering. Drought-tolerant once established, preferring drier conditions over waterlogged soil. |

## 🌱 Overview
Argyranthemum (marguerite, marguerite daisy, dill daisy) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.  Members of this genus are sometimes also placed in the genus Chrysanthemum.
The genus is endemic to Macaronesia, occurring only on the Canary Islands, the Savage Islands, and Madeira.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Dill Daisy thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native Canary Islands habitat. It prefers infrequent, deep watering and is quite drought-tolerant once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly, perhaps once a month during the active growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Avoid heavy feeding, especially in the poor, rocky soils it's adapted to.
