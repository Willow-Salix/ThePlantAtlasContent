## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern United States (particularly the Southeast), Central America |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light; avoid direct, intense sun which can cause desiccation. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity is crucial. Frequent misting or placement in a humid environment is necessary to absorb moisture from the air, as it does not rely on substrate watering like vascular plants. |

## Introduction
Tomasellia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Naetrocymbaceae. It comprises seven species of corticolous (bark-dwelling), crustose lichens.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in highly humid environments with consistent indirect light, mimicking its native humid subtropical forest habitat. It requires high ambient humidity and frequent misting rather than traditional watering, and should not be fertilized due to its sensitivity.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens are highly sensitive to external nutrients and pollutants, which can be detrimental.
