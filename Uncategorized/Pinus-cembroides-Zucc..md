## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico and Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) |
| **Climate** | Arid Montane Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, ideally 6+ hours of direct sunlight daily, as it grows in open, exposed mountain slopes. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Established plants require minimal supplemental water, mimicking their native low-rainfall environment. |

## Introduction
Pinus cembroides, also known as pinyon pine, Mexican pinyon, Mexican nut pine, and Mexican stone pine, is a pine in the pinyon pine group.
It is a small pine growing to about 20 m (66 ft) with a trunk diameter of up to 50 cm (20 in). It is native to western North America. It grows in areas with low levels of rainfall and its range extends southwards from Arizona, Texas and New Mexico in the United States into Mexico. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,600 and 2,400 m (5,200 and 7,900 ft).
The seeds are large and form part of the diet of the Mexican jay and Abert's squirrel. They are also collected for human consumption, being the most widely used pine nut in Mexico.

## Care Guide
This hardy conifer thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, reflecting its native arid montane habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering once established. Minimal fertilization is typically needed.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced fertilizer formulated for conifers, typically once a year in spring, as native soils are generally lean and rocky.
