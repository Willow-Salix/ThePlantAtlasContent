| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., USA: Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona) |
| **Climate** | High Desert/Montane Semi-arid |
| **Sunlight** | High direct sun exposure; thrives in full sun and strong UV light on exposed rock surfaces. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent moisture; tolerant of long dry periods and requires excellent drainage. Moisture is primarily from occasional precipitation. |

## Introduction
Aspicilia (sunken disk lichen) is a genus of mostly crustose areolate lichens that grow on rock. Most members have black apothecia discs that are slightly immersed in the areolas, hence the common name"Given the same reason, the  naming of Aspicilia is derived from the Greek word for "shield concave". 
Most of the species of this genus grow on calcareous and acidic rocks and most of the taxa prefer temperate and arctic habitats.
Some members of the genus Aspicilia are pioneer species on granite and other hard rock, after which members of other lichen species may grow on them, such as members of Acarospora.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in harsh, exposed environments. Provide abundant direct sunlight and very infrequent moisture, mimicking its native semi-arid, rocky habitat. No fertilization is required, as it obtains nutrients from its surroundings.

### Fertilizer
No external fertilizer is needed; obtains nutrients from the air and minerals in its rock substrate.
