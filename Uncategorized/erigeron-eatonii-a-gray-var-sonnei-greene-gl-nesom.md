## 🧤 Care Instructions
Eaton's fleabane thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-draining soil, mimicking its montane origins. It requires moderate watering during its active growth but is quite drought-tolerant once established. Minimal fertilization is typically needed for this resilient native wildflower.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils characteristic of its native environment; heavy fertilization is generally not required.
