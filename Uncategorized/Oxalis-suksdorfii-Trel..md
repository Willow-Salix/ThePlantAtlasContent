## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Open Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial sun to partial shade. Can tolerate full sun in cooler, moist coastal regions but benefits from afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil during its active growing season. Allow the top layer of soil to dry slightly before re-watering, but do not let it dry out completely. Reduce watering during dormancy. |

## Introduction
Oxalis ( (British English) or  (American English)) is a large genus of flowering plants in the wood-sorrel family, Oxalidaceae, comprising over 550 species. The genus occurs throughout most of the world, except for the polar areas; species diversity is particularly rich in tropical Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.
Many of the species are known as wood-sorrels (also as wood sorrels or woodsorrels) as they have an acidic taste reminiscent of the sorrel proper (Rumex acetosa), which is not closely related. Some species are called yellow sorrels or pink sorrels after the colour of their flowers instead. Other species are colloquially known as false shamrocks, and some called sourgrasses. For the genus as a whole, the term oxalises is also used.

## Care Guide
This temperate plant thrives in partial sun to partial shade with consistently moist soil. Fertilize moderately during active growth and protect from intense afternoon sun in warmer areas. Allow a slight dry-out between waterings and reduce watering in dormancy.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeder. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during the growing period. Reduce or cease fertilization during dormancy.
