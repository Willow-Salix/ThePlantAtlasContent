## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States, primarily Florida and adjacent states like Georgia and Alabama |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest/Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade. Prefers dappled sunlight, mimicking its native habitat under a forest canopy or at woodland edges. Avoid direct, intense afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist, but not waterlogged, soil. The plant thrives in the humid conditions and ample rainfall characteristic of its native subtropical environment. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Dioscorea is a genus of over 600 species of flowering plants in the family Dioscoreaceae, native throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of the world. The vast majority of the species are tropical, with only a few species extending into temperate climates. It was named by the monk Charles Plumier after the ancient Greek physician and botanist Dioscorides.

## Care Guide
This variety of Wild Yam thrives in conditions mimicking its native humid subtropical woodland environment. It requires partial to full shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Moderate fertilization will support its growth as a climbing vine.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Benefits from a balanced, organic-rich soil. Amending with compost or a slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring can support healthy growth, reflecting the nutrient cycling in its native woodland setting.
