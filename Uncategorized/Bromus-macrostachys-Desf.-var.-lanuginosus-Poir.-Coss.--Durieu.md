| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun exposure as found in open fields and dry grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires moderate watering during active growth (winter/spring in its native climate), but can withstand dry summer periods. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Bromus ramosus, the hairy brome, is a bunchgrass in the grass family Poaceae, native to Europe, northwest Africa and southwest Asia. The name Bromus comes from the term brome, meaning oats. Unlike most other bromes (Bromus sp.), it grows in shady sites under trees.

## Care Guide
This Mediterranean grass thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, exhibiting strong drought tolerance once established. Water moderately during its active growth period, typically in cooler, wetter seasons, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Minimal fertilization is required, as it is adapted to poorer soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility needs. Thrives in average, well-draining soils. Over-fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
