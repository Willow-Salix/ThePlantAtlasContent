## 🌱 Overview
Lycopodium (from Ancient Greek lykos, wolf and podion, diminutive of pous, foot) is a genus of clubmosses, also known as ground pines or creeping cedars, in the family Lycopodiaceae. Two very different circumscriptions of the genus are in use. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Lycopodium is one of nine genera in the subfamily Lycopodioideae, and has from nine to 15 species. In other classifications, the genus is equivalent to the whole of the subfamily, since it includes all of the other genera. More than 40 species are accepted.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This clubmoss thrives in high humidity and consistent moisture, mimicking its native wet forest environment. Provide filtered to indirect bright light and ensure the soil remains damp but never soggy. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted solution to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder. Apply a diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 strength) every 2-4 months during the growing season (spring to fall).
