## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar regions including North America (Canada, Alaska), Northern Europe (Scandinavia, UK), Northern Asia (Siberia), and cool temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Boreal Forests (Taiga), Tundra, Temperate Heathlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Thrives in open, exposed areas; tolerates full sun in cooler climates or partial shade under sparse tree canopies. |
| **💧 Water** | Absorbs moisture directly from air humidity and rainfall. Requires moderate to high humidity with occasional watering/misting, allowing for periods of drying out between moisture events to prevent rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cladonia rangiferina, also known as reindeer cup lichen, reindeer lichen (cf. Sw. renlav) or grey reindeer lichen, is a light-coloured fruticose, cup lichen species in the family Cladoniaceae. It grows in both hot and cold climates in well-drained, open environments. Found primarily in areas of alpine tundra, it is extremely cold-hardy.
Other common names include reindeer moss, deer moss, and caribou moss, but these names can be misleading since it is, though somewhat moss-like in appearance, not a moss. As the common names suggest, reindeer lichen is an important food for reindeer (caribou), and has economic importance as a result. Synonyms include Cladina rangiferina and Lichen rangiferinus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Reindeer Lichen thrives in cool, well-ventilated environments with moderate to high light exposure. It primarily absorbs moisture from air humidity and occasional rainfall, requiring periods of drying out. No fertilizer is needed due to its extreme sensitivity to rich nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is needed. Lichens are extremely sensitive to rich nutrients and pollutants, thriving in nutrient-poor environments.
