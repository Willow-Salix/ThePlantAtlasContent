## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage with very infrequent watering, mimicking its arid desert origins. Fertilization is generally not needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; native soils are typically poor in nutrients. If necessary, a very dilute, balanced slow-release fertilizer during active growth.
