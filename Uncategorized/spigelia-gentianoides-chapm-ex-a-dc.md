## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in bright, indirect light to partial sun, with protection from intense afternoon sun. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and benefits from regular watering, mimicking its humid subtropical native habitat. Fertilization should be minimal, supporting its adaptation to naturally occurring soil nutrient levels.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season is sufficient, particularly in poorer sandy soils.
