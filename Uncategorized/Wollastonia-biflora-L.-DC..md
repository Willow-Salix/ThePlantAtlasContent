| **Native Origin** | Indo-Pacific region, including East Africa, Southeast Asia, Northern Australia, and Pacific Islands |
| **Climate** | Tropical Coastal (beach fronts, dunes, coral atolls) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open coastal areas. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, especially during dry periods, allowing the top few inches of soil to dry out between waterings. It needs excellent drainage, mimicking its native sandy soils. |

## Care Guide
The Beach Sunflower thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its tropical coastal habitat. Water regularly to maintain consistent moisture, allowing for periods of slight dryness between waterings, and fertilize sparingly to support its growth in naturally lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to light fertilization. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor sandy and coral soils and does not require heavy feeding.
