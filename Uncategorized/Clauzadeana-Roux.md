# Clauzadeana Lichen

*Clauzadeana Roux* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in Temperate Zones, particularly Europe and North America |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rocky Outcrops |
| **Sunlight** | Full to partial sun exposure, characteristic of open, exposed rock surfaces in its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Absorbs moisture directly from atmospheric humidity, rain, and dew; highly tolerant of prolonged dry periods, as it does not require root-based water uptake. |

## Introduction
Clauzadeana is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the  family Lecanoraceae. The genus was circumscribed in 1984 by Claude Roux,  with the crustose species C. instratula assigned as the type.
The genus name Clauzadeana honours F.J. Georges Clauzade (1914–2002), a French teacher and botanist (Mycology and Lichenology).

## Care Guide
Clauzadeana lichens are extremely hardy organisms adapted to exposed, nutrient-poor rocky habitats in temperate climates. They require intermittent atmospheric moisture and ample light, thriving without traditional watering or fertilization by absorbing resources directly from their environment.

### Fertilizer
No external fertilizer is required; Clauzadeana lichens obtain necessary nutrients from the air and their rock substrate, thriving in nutrient-poor conditions.
