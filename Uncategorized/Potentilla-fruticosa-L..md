## Care Guide
This very hardy and adaptable shrub thrives in full sun and well-drained, consistently moist soil. It is low-maintenance, requiring minimal fertilization and tolerating a wide range of conditions once established.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. If desired, a light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, but it often performs well without it, particularly in naturally fertile soils.
