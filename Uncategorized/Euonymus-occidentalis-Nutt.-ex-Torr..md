## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (primarily California, Oregon, and Washington, USA) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Riparian Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial to full shade, thriving in the understory of moist woodlands. Can tolerate some morning sun, but protection from intense afternoon sun is crucial. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, reflective of its native habitat along streambanks and in damp woods. Water regularly, especially during dry spells, to maintain soil moisture, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Euonymus  is a genus of flowering plants in the staff vine family Celastraceae. Common names vary widely among different species and between different English-speaking countries, but include spindle (or spindle tree), burning-bush, strawberry-bush, wahoo, wintercreeper, or simply euonymus. It has about 140 species of deciduous and evergreen shrubs, small trees and lianas. They are mostly native to East Asia, extending to the Himalayas, and they are also distributed in Europe, Australasia, North America, and Madagascar. Fifty species are endemic to China.

## Care Guide
To care for the Western Burning Bush, provide a consistently moist, shaded environment that mimics its native riparian habitat. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry periods, and offer moderate fertilization to support its growth. Protect the plant from harsh, direct afternoon sun.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertility. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or a top dressing of organic compost in spring will support healthy growth, as native soils are typically rich in organic matter.
