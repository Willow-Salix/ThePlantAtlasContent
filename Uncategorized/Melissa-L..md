## Introduction
Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) is a perennial herbaceous plant in the mint family. It has lemon-scented leaves, white or pale pink flowers, and contains essential oils and compounds like geranial and neral. It grows to a maximum height of 1 m (3+1⁄2 ft). The species is native to south-central Europe, the Mediterranean, Central Asia, and Iran, is now naturalized worldwide and grows easily from seed in rich, moist soil.
The name Melissa officinalis comes from the Greek word for "honey bee," due to the plant's bee-attracting flowers, and the Latin officinalis, referring to its traditional use in apothecaries.  It has been cultivated (and used to attract honey bees) since at least the 16th century.  Lemon balm grows vigorously from seed or vegetative fragments in temperate zones, with key producers like Hungary, Egypt, and Italy cultivating various cultivars for hand-harvested leaves and low-yield essential oil, notably in Ireland.  Lemon balm is used in Carmelite Water, as an ornamental plant, in perfumes and toothpaste, as a raw or cooked herb in various foods and teas, and is valued for its bee-attracting properties and aromatic essential oils.
