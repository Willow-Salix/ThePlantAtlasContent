## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (USA: Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, high-altitude native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent to moderate watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, mimicking seasonal dryness in its native range. |

## Introduction
Parthenium is a genus of North American annuals, biennials, perennials, subshrubs, and shrubs in the tribe Heliantheae within the family Asteraceae and subfamily Asteroideae.
The name Parthenium is an evolution of the Ancient Greek name παρθένιον (parthenion), which referred to Tanacetum parthenium. The name is possibly derived from the Greek word παρθένος (parthenos) which means "virgin".
Members of the genus are commonly known as feverfew. Notable species include guayule (P. argentatum) which has been used as a rubber substitute, especially during the Second World War; and also P. hysterophorus, a serious invasive species in the Old World.

## Care Guide
This alpine native thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, ideally rocky or sandy. Water infrequently, allowing thorough drying between sessions, and avoid rich fertilization as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; it thrives in poor, rocky soils, so rich fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
