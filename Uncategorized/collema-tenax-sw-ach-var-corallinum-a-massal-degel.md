## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread (cosmopolitan), found across temperate to subpolar regions on base-rich soils and rocks. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Moist to Cool Temperate |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Avoid intense, direct sun which can lead to rapid desiccation and stress. |
| **💧 Water** | Frequent moisture is crucial for the lichen's metabolic activity. Provide regular misting or saturate the substrate, allowing it to dry out partially between rehydration cycles. Does not tolerate prolonged drought when active or continuous waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Collema (jelly lichen) is a genus of lichens in the family Collemataceae. The photobiont is the cyanobacterium genus Nostoc. Species in this genus typically grow on nutrient-rich bark or somewhat siliceous or calcareous rocks in humid environments.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in bright indirect light to partial shade, requiring frequent moisture to remain metabolically active, similar to its humid native habitat. Allow the substrate to partially dry between watering, but avoid prolonged desiccation. Fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain nutrients from the atmosphere and their substrate; traditional fertilizers can be harmful to their symbiotic relationship.
