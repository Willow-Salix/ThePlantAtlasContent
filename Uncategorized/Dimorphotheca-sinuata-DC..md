Thriving in full sun and well-draining soil, the Glandular Cape Marigold is a resilient annual well-suited to conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering and minimal fertilization. Ensuring ample sunlight and avoiding overwatering are key to its successful cultivation.
