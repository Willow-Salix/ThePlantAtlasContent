## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico (Coahuila, Durango, Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí) |
| **Climate** | Arid Desert (Chihuahuan Desert) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright indirect light, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, typical of open desert environments. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water thoroughly during the active growing season (spring/summer) and drastically reduce or cease watering during dormancy (fall/winter) to mimic desert rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Mammillaria is one of the largest genera in the cactus family (Cactaceae), with currently 200 known species and varieties recognized. Most of the mammillarias are native to Mexico, while some come from the Southwestern United States, the Caribbean, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras and Venezuela. The common name "pincushion cactus" refers to this genus and the closely related Escobaria.
The first species was described by Carl Linnaeus as Cactus mammillaris in 1753, deriving its name from the Latin mammilla, "nipple", referring to the tubercles that are among the distinctive features of the genus. Numerous species are commonly known as globe cactus, nipple cactus, birthday cake cactus, fishhook cactus or pincushion cactus (though such terms are also commonly used for related taxa, such as Escobaria or Ferocactus).

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in abundant sunlight and requires minimal, infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely to prevent root rot. Provide a diluted, specialized cactus fertilizer during its active growth period in spring and summer, ensuring well-draining soil for optimal health in conditions mimicking its arid native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Apply a diluted, balanced cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer) only, as native desert soils are generally not rich.
