## Care Guide
This Phlox variety thrives in full sun to light partial shade and prefers well-drained soil with moderate, consistent moisture. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established and benefits from light fertilization in spring. Ensure good air circulation to maintain plant health.

### Fertilizer
