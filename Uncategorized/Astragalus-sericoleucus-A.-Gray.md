## Care Guide
Silky Milkvetch thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid Western North American habitat, requiring full sun and very infrequent watering once established due to its drought tolerance. It prefers lean, well-draining soil and has minimal fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance plant ideal for xeric gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches its own soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer may be beneficial in very poor soils, but generally unnecessary.
