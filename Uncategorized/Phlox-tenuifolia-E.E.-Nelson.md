## Care Guide
Santa Catalina Mountain Phlox thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its arid montane habitat. Water moderately, letting the soil dry out between applications, and apply fertilizer sparingly. This species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically requires minimal fertilization, a light, balanced feed in spring if growth is poor.
