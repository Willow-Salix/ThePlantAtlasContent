| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, ideally receiving at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for best fruiting. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil; water regularly, especially during dry spells and fruit development, but avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
The blackberry is an edible fruit ("berry") produced by many species in the genus Rubus in the family Rosaceae, hybrids among these species within the subgenus Rubus, and hybrids between the subgenera Rubus and Idaeobatus. The taxonomy of blackberries has historically been confused because of hybridization and apomixis so that species have often been grouped together and called species aggregates.
Blackberry fruit production is abundant with annual volumes of 20,000 pounds (9,100 kg) per 1 acre (0.40 ha) possible, making this plant commercially attractive.
Rubus armeniacus (Himalayan or Armenian blackberry) is considered a noxious weed and invasive species in many regions of the Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States, where it grows out of control in urban and suburban parks and woodlands.

## Care Guide
This blackberry species thrives in conditions similar to its native humid subtropical climate. Ensure it receives ample sunlight and is grown in consistently moist, well-drained soil. Fertilize moderately in spring to support healthy growth and fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring as new growth emerges.
