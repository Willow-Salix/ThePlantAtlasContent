## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern Australia (New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodlands, Heathlands, and Riparian Zones |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers full sun for optimal flowering and growth, but can tolerate some afternoon shade, especially in hotter regions. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist, reflecting its native habitat in damp or boggy areas near watercourses. While established plants can tolerate short dry spells, regular moisture is key for thriving. |

## Introduction
Leptospermum  is a genus of shrubs and small trees in the myrtle family Myrtaceae commonly known as tea trees, although this name is sometimes also used for some species of Melaleuca. Most species are endemic to Australia, with the greatest diversity in the south of the continent, but some are native to other parts of the world, including New Zealand and Southeast Asia. Leptospermums all have five conspicuous petals and five groups of stamens which alternate with the petals. There is a single style in the centre of the flower and the fruit is a woody capsule.
The first formal description of a leptospermum was published in 1776 by the German botanists Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Johann Georg Adam Forster, but an unambiguous definition of individual species in the genus was not achieved until 1979. Leptospermums grow in a wide range of habitats but are most commonly found in moist, low-nutrient soils. They have important uses in horticulture, in the production of honey and in floristry.

## Care Guide
This Australian native thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, particularly when establishing. Avoid high-phosphorus fertilizers, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. Once established, it is relatively low-maintenance and can tolerate some variation in moisture.

### Fertilizer
Requires very low phosphorus fertilizer, or none at all, as it is adapted to naturally poor Australian soils. High phosphorus levels can be detrimental.
