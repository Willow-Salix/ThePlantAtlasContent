# Golden Currant

*Chrysobotrya aurea (Pursh) Rydb.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western and Central North America, including much of the western United States, Canada, and parts of Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodlands and Shrublands (including riparian zones, prairies, and open slopes) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives with ample sunlight but can tolerate some afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the topsoil to dry out between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, but appreciates regular moisture during dry spells. |

## Care Guide
The Golden Currant is a resilient shrub, best suited for full sun to partial shade in temperate climates. It requires moderate watering, tolerating dry periods once established, and has low fertilizer needs. This makes it a relatively easy-care plant ideal for a variety of garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, especially in poorer soils.
