## Care Guide
The Anglepod thrives in conditions mimicking its native humid subtropical environment, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growth period to support its vining habit.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, general-purpose liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
