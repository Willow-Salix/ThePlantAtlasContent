## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Sahel region of West Africa |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid Tropical (Sahelian climate) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant, prefers periods of dryness between waterings. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the topsoil to dry out. More frequent watering is beneficial during germination and active growth, especially in hot conditions. |

## Introduction
Pearl millet (Cenchrus americanus, commonly known as the synonym Pennisetum  glaucum) is the most widely grown type of millet. It has been grown in Africa and the Indian subcontinent since prehistoric times. The center of diversity and suggested area of domestication for the crop is in the Sahel zone of West Africa.

## Care Guide
Pearl Millet thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Provide deep, infrequent watering once established, increasing frequency only during active growth or extreme heat. It benefits from light to moderate fertilization, especially if grown for grain production, but can tolerate less fertile soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Can tolerate poor soils, but benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost application at planting or during early growth for optimal yield.
