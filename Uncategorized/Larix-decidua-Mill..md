## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mountains of central Europe (Alps, Carpathians) across countries like France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Romania. |
| **Climate** | Montane Coniferous Forest / Subalpine Forest (Temperate, cold-hardy mountainous climate with distinct seasons, cold winters, and moderate summers). |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its natural occurrence in open, exposed high-altitude environments. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil. Regular watering is crucial, especially when young or during dry periods, but established trees can tolerate short dry spells. Avoid waterlogged conditions. |

## Introduction
Larix decidua, the European larch, is a species of larch native to the mountains of central Europe, in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains, with small disjunct lowland populations in northern Poland. Its life span has been confirmed to be close to 1000 years, with ages of around 2000 years likely.

## Care Guide
The European Larch thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil, replicating its native mountainous environment. It benefits from minimal fertilization, with a balanced, slow-release feed in spring supporting its robust growth as a cold-hardy conifer.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once annually in early spring, particularly in poor soils, to support healthy growth.
