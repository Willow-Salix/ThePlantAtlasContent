## Care Guide
This hardy wild rose thrives in full sun and is quite adaptable to various soil conditions. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and provide minimal fertilization as it is not a heavy feeder. Once established, it is relatively drought tolerant and low maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Low (annual application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is sufficient; excessive fertilization is not needed for this wild rose)
