## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Oklahoma) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Grassland, Prairie, and Rocky Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and abundant flowering. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its arid native habitat. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Care Guide
Hartweg's Sundrops is a sun-loving, drought-tolerant perennial that thrives in arid to semi-arid conditions. It requires full sun and well-draining soil, preferring infrequent deep watering and minimal fertilizer to flourish and produce its characteristic yellow blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant thrives in lean to average soils and typically does not require heavy fertilization; a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if soil nutrients are poor.
