| **Native Origin** | Maui, Hawaii, USA |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Wet Forest and Subalpine Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun, typical of montane forest edges or open shrublands. Avoid intense, direct midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained, reflecting the frequent rainfall and high humidity of its native habitat. Do not allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Solanum is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants, which include three food crops of high economic importance: the potato, the tomato and the eggplant (aubergine, brinjal). It is the largest genus in the nightshade family Solanaceae, comprising around 1,500 species. It also contains the so-called horse nettles (unrelated to the genus of true nettles, Urtica), as well as numerous plants cultivated for their ornamental flowers and fruit.
Solanum species show a wide range of growth habits, such as annuals and perennials, vines, subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees. Many formerly independent genera like Lycopersicon (the tomatoes) and Cyphomandra are now included in Solanum as subgenera or sections. Thus, the genus today contains roughly 1,500–2,000 species.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native Hawaiian montane habitat, requiring bright indirect light, consistently moist well-drained soil, and high humidity. Protect it from extreme temperatures and provide light fertilization during active growth for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Light, balanced liquid fertilizer applied monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in winter.
