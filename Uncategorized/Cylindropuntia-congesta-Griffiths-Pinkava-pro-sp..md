## Care Guide
This desert hybrid thrives in conditions mirroring its arid native habitat. Provide abundant direct sunlight, very infrequent watering allowing the soil to dry out completely, and minimal fertilizer. Ensure extremely well-draining soil to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low. Use a balanced, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer diluted to half strength, sparingly once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer).
