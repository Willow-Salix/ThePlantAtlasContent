## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Central Asian native thrives in conditions mimicking its arid steppe origin, requiring full sun exposure. It is highly drought-tolerant, so infrequent watering with well-draining soil is crucial to prevent root rot. Minimal fertilization supports its natural adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in early spring is sufficient, especially in poor soils.
