## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically the Great Plains and intermountain regions of the United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Grassland and Open Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) as it originates from open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low; drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between infrequent waterings, mimicking the dry periods of its native climate. Sensitive to overwatering. |

## Introduction
Lappula is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family known generally as stickseeds. They are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the world, including North America, Eurasia, North Africa, South Africa, and southern South America. These are annual herbs producing funnel-shaped flowers and prickly fruits. One of the best known species is the European stickseed, Lappula squarrosa, which is a notorious noxious weed.

## Care Guide
Flatspine Stickseed thrives in sunny, dry conditions typical of its native semi-arid grasslands. Provide full sun and ensure excellent soil drainage to prevent root rot. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to fully dry out between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental to a plant adapted to nutrient-sparse environments.
