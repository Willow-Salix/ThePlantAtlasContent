## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Moist Woodlands and Riparian Zones |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade (tolerates various light conditions from open areas to forest edges) |
| **Watering** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native habitat along stream banks and wetlands. Do not allow soil to dry out. |

## Introduction
Cornus is a genus of about 30–60 species of woody plants in the family Cornaceae, commonly known as dogwoods or cornels, which can generally be distinguished by their blossoms, berries, and distinctive bark. Most are deciduous trees or shrubs, but a few species are nearly herbaceous perennial subshrubs, and some species are evergreen. Several species have small heads of inconspicuous flowers surrounded by an involucre of large, typically white petal-like bracts, while others have more open clusters of petal-bearing flowers. The various species of dogwood are native throughout much of temperate and boreal Eurasia and North America, with China, Japan, and the southeastern United States being particularly rich in native species. The genus is also known from South America with members such as Cornus peruviana. 
Species include the common dogwood Cornus sanguinea of Eurasia, the widely cultivated flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) of eastern North America, the Pacific dogwood Cornus nuttallii of western North America, the Kousa dogwood Cornus kousa of eastern Asia, and two low-growing boreal species, the Canadian and Eurasian dwarf cornels (or bunchberries), Cornus canadensis and Cornus suecica respectively.
Depending on botanical interpretation, the dogwoods are variously divided into one to nine genera or subgenera; a broadly inclusive genus Cornus is accepted here.

## Care Guide
This vigorous shrub thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, favoring full sun to partial shade to mimic its native riparian and woodland environments. Ensure high water availability and well-draining yet moisture-retentive soil, requiring minimal fertilization due to its adaptability to varying soil richness.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally benefits from rich, organic soil but does not require heavy fertilization. An annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient.
