## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Alpine and subalpine regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe (e.g., Alps, Scandinavia), North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Alaska), and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and high-altitude Boreal Climates, characterized by cold temperatures, regular snow cover, and seasonal atmospheric moisture. |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure, reflecting its natural habitat in open, exposed montane and alpine environments. Can tolerate some partial shade if accompanied by adequate moisture. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular access to atmospheric moisture (e.g., misting, high humidity, or simulated melting snow conditions) interspersed with periods of complete drying. Avoid constant wetness, which can promote fungal growth. |

## Introduction
Placocarpus schaereri is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), areolate, and crustose lichen in the family Verrucariaceae. Found in Europe and West Asia, it is the type species of genus Placocarpus. Juvenile forms of Placocarpus schaereri are often parasitic on the lichen Protoparmeliopsis muralis.

## Care Guide
To cultivate this lichen, provide high light levels mimicking its exposed alpine origin, along with consistent atmospheric moisture and periods of desiccation. Ensure good air circulation and avoid over-watering, as it thrives on natural nutrient cycling and does not require conventional fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient needs; obtains necessary elements from airborne particles and mineral trace elements from its substrate. Conventional fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
