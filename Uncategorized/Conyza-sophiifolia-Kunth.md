## Introduction
Conyza (horseweed, butterweed or fleabane) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.
They are native to tropical and warm temperate regions throughout the world, and also north into cool temperate regions in North America and eastern Asia. The New World species of the genus are closely related to Erigeron (also known as fleabanes).
The species are annual or perennial herbaceous plants, rarely shrubs, growing to 1–2 m tall. The stems are erect, branched, with alternate leaves. The flowers are produced in inflorescences, with several inflorescences loosely clustered on each stem.
Many species of the genus Conyza are ruderal species and some have been found to be resistant to the herbicide glyphosate.

## Care Guide
Conyza sophiifolia thrives in full to partial sun with moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions. It is adaptable to average soil fertility and generally requires minimal supplemental fertilizer. This resilient plant is well-suited to conditions mirroring its native tropical and subtropical open habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season is sufficient.
