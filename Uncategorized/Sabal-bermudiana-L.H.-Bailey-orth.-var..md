## Introduction
Sabal bermudana, commonly known as the Bermuda palmetto or bibby-tree, is one of 15 species of palm trees in the genus Sabal and is endemic to Bermuda although reportedly naturalized in the Leeward Islands. It was greatly affected by the introduction of non-native plants such as the Chinese fan palm, which created competition for space that it usually lost.

## Care Guide
The Bermuda Palmetto thrives in full sun and requires moderate, consistent watering, particularly when young, though established plants can tolerate brief dry spells. Fertilize regularly with a palm-specific formula to support healthy growth and nutrient uptake. This resilient subtropical palm prefers well-draining soil.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a slow-release, palm-specific fertilizer rich in potassium and magnesium during the growing season (spring/summer) to mimic nutrient availability in its native environment.
