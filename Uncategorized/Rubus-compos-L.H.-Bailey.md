| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives with at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for best fruit production, but can tolerate some afternoon shade. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, especially during dry spells and fruit development, to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Good drainage is essential. |

## Introduction
The blackberry is an edible fruit ("berry") produced by many species in the genus Rubus in the family Rosaceae, hybrids among these species within the subgenus Rubus, and hybrids between the subgenera Rubus and Idaeobatus. The taxonomy of blackberries has historically been confused because of hybridization and apomixis so that species have often been grouped together and called species aggregates.
Blackberry fruit production is abundant with annual volumes of 20,000 pounds (9,100 kg) per 1 acre (0.40 ha) possible, making this plant commercially attractive.
Rubus armeniacus (Himalayan or Armenian blackberry) is considered a noxious weed and invasive species in many regions of the Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States, where it grows out of control in urban and suburban parks and woodlands.

## Care Guide
This blackberry species, native to temperate forests, requires ample sunlight and consistent moisture for healthy growth and fruit production. Ensure well-drained soil and provide moderate nutrients annually to support its vigorous nature.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Benefits from an annual application of balanced fertilizer or compost in early spring, especially if soil is poor or fruit production is desired.
