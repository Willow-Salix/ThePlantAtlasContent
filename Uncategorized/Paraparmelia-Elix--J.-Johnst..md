## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Australia (primarily arid and semi-arid regions) |
| **Climate** | Arid Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to high light exposure, mimicking open, exposed habitats on rocks or sparse soil. |
| **Watering** | Extremely infrequent; allow for complete desiccation between watering. Mimic sporadic rainfall, dew, or fog, ensuring long dry periods. |

## Introduction
Xanthoparmelia (commonly known as green rock shields or rock-shield lichens) is a genus of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. This genus of lichen is commonly found in the United States, South America, southern Africa, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
The name means 'golden yellow parmelia'. The photobiont (photosynthetic partner) is Trebouxia (a genus of green algae).

## Care Guide
Paraparmelia lichens thrive in conditions mimicking their arid Australian origins: requiring full sun exposure and extremely infrequent watering that allows for complete drying. Fertilization is unnecessary and should be avoided, as these organisms derive nutrients from their environment and are sensitive to added chemicals.

### Fertilizer
None; lichens derive nutrients from air and substrate minerals and are highly sensitive to external fertilizers, which can be detrimental.
