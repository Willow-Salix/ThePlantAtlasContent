## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Boulder, Colorado, USA (Rocky Mountain region of North America) |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid Montane/Alpine |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure, tolerating direct sunlight for extended periods due to its exposed rock-dwelling nature in a high-altitude environment. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and primarily from atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, snowmelt); highly tolerant of prolonged dry periods between moisture events. |

## Introduction
Acarospora is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Acarosporaceae. Most species in the genus are crustose lichens that grow on rocks in open and arid places all over the world. They may look like a cobblestone road or cracked up old paint, and are commonly called cobblestone lichens or cracked lichens. They usually grow on rock (are "saxicolous"), but some grow on soil (terricolous) or on other lichens. Some species in the genus are fungi that live as parasites on other lichens (lichenicolous fungi). Acarospora is a widely distributed genus, with about 128 species according to a 2008 estimate.
Species in Acarospora may be shiny as if covered with a glossy varnish, or dull and powdery looking. They have a diverse range of colors, from the brilliant yellow bright cobblestone lichen, to the dark reddish-brown mountain cobblestone lichen, or they can appear tan, gray, or white, from a dusty-looking coating (pruina). They may grow in crustose forms like a warty surface (verrucose), like cracking-up old crust of paint (rimose), like a bunch of "islands" in a dry lake bed (areolate), like the flakes of cracking up paint are peeling up at the edges (sub-squamulous), or like the flakes are growing over others like scales (squamulous).

## Care Guide
This rock-dwelling lichen thrives in high sun exposure and requires minimal care, primarily needing periods of dryness punctuated by occasional atmospheric moisture. No typical watering or fertilization is needed, as it naturally derives sustenance from its environment.

### Fertilizer
None; obtains necessary trace nutrients from the air and the rock substrate it grows upon.
