## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern Oregon and northwestern California, USA (Siskiyou Mountains) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers bright light but appreciates some afternoon protection in hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings. Essential to provide excellent drainage and avoid winter wetness around the crown. |

## Introduction
Lewisia is a plant genus, named for the American explorer Meriwether Lewis (1774-1809) who encountered the species in 1806. The native habitat of Lewisia species is rocky ground and cliffs in western North America. Native Americans ate the roots, which have also been used to treat sore throats.

## Care Guide
Howell's Lewisia requires sharp drainage and bright light, mimicking its rocky, montane origins. Water deeply when dry during its active growth, reducing it significantly during summer dormancy and protecting from winter wetness to prevent rot. It thrives on lean soil and dislikes rich conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. A very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in early spring, but often not necessary if grown in suitable rocky, lean soil.
