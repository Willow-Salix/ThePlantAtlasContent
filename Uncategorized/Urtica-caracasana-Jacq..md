| **Sunlight** | Indirect bright light to partial shade, mimicking the dappled light of a humid forest understory or frequent cloud cover. |

## Introduction
Urtica is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. Many species have stinging hairs and may be called nettles or stinging nettles (the latter name applying particularly to U. dioica). The generic name Urtica derives from the Latin for 'sting'.
Due to the stinging hairs, Urtica are rarely eaten by herbivores, but provide shelter for insects. The fiber has historically been used by humans, and cooking preparations exist.

## Care Guide
To care for Caracas Nettle, provide conditions that mimic its native tropical montane forest, including indirect bright light and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Maintain high humidity and fertilize moderately during active growth to support its vigorous nature.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding during the growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer, as tropical montane forest soils are typically rich in organic matter.
