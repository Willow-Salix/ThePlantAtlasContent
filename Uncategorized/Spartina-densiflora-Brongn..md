## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Atlantic coast of temperate South America (Argentina, Chile) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coastal Salt Marsh |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its open marsh habitat. |
| **Watering** | High water requirements, tolerating and often preferring constantly wet or waterlogged soil conditions, including brackish or salt water inundation, mimicking its intertidal marsh environment. |

## Introduction
Spartina is a genus of plants in the grass family, frequently found in coastal salt marshes. Species in this genus are commonly known as cordgrass or cord-grass, and are native to the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean in western and southern Europe, north-western and southern Africa, the Americas and the islands of the southern Atlantic Ocean; one or two species also occur on the western coast of North America and in freshwater habitats inland in the Americas. The highest species diversity is on the east coasts of North and South America, particularly Florida. They form large, often dense colonies, particularly on coastal salt marshes, and grow quickly. The species vary in size from 0.3–2 m tall. Many of the species will produce hybrids if they come into contact.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and consistently wet to waterlogged conditions, including brackish or saltwater. Mimicking its native temperate salt marsh environment is key to its care, with minimal fertilizer typically required.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it's adapted to often nutrient-rich but sometimes fluctuating marsh sediments. Supplemental feeding is rarely necessary in suitable environments.
