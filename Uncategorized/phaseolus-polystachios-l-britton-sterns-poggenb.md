## 🌱 Overview
Phaseolus (bean, wild bean) is a genus of herbaceous to woody annual and perennial vines in the family Fabaceae containing about 70 plant species, all native to the Americas, primarily Mesoamerica.
It is one of the most economically important legume genera. Five of the species have been domesticated since pre-Columbian times for their beans: P. acutifolius (tepary bean), P. coccineus (runner bean), P. dumosus (year bean), P. lunatus (lima bean), and P. vulgaris (common bean). Most prominent among these is the common bean, P. vulgaris, which today is cultivated worldwide in tropical, semitropical, and temperate climates.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thicket Bean thrives in temperate conditions, preferring partial to full sun and consistently moist soil. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so high-nitrogen fertilizers are generally not necessary. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring or moderately fertile soil is usually sufficient.
