## Care Guide
Seaside Fiddleneck thrives in full sun, reflecting its native coastal exposure. It prefers well-draining soil and is quite drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering, especially after its main growth period. Fertilization is generally not necessary, as it adapts well to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally not required. May benefit from a light, balanced fertilizer in very poor soils.
