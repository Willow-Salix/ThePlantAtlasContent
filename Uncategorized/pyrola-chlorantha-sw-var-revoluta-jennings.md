## 🌱 Overview
Pyrola  is a genus of evergreen herbaceous plants in the family Ericaceae. Under the old Cronquist system it was placed in its own family Pyrolaceae, but genetic research showed it belonged in the family Ericaceae. The species are commonly known as wintergreen, a name shared with several other related and unrelated plants (see wintergreen for details). They are native to northern temperate and Arctic regions.
They are rather small plants with a rosette of simple orbicular or ovate leaves, with a flower stem bearing generally rather lax racemes of simple white, cream or pink flowers. The immediate distinguishing feature of Pyrola species is the flower style which is often curved, sticks out beyond the petals and is expanded below the stigma which itself is branched into several lobes. To the casual observer the flower appears to have a small bell-clapper sticking out.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide a cool, humid environment with consistent moisture and deep shade. Utilize well-draining, acidic soil rich in organic matter, and refrain from heavy fertilization due to its natural nutrient acquisition methods often involving fungal partnerships.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low, prefers nutrient-poor, humus-rich soil; excessive fertilization can be harmful and disrupt natural fungal associations
