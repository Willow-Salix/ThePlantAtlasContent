## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, including parts of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests (Rainforests) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate, filtered light. Prefers indirect light conditions, avoiding direct, intense sunlight typical of its undercanopy or semi-shaded forest habitat. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and consistent moisture are crucial. It requires frequent exposure to rainfall or high atmospheric humidity and does not tolerate prolonged dry periods, absorbing water directly from the environment. |

## Introduction
Phaeographina is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Graphidaceae. The genus was circumscribed by Swiss lichenologist Johannes Müller Argoviensis in 1882.

## Care Guide
Phaeographina scalpturata thrives in environments mimicking its native tropical and subtropical moist forest habitats, demanding high humidity and consistent moisture. It prefers low to moderate, filtered light and does not require traditional fertilization, absorbing nutrients directly from the ambient environment.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens like Phaeographina scalpturata absorb all necessary nutrients directly from the air and rainwater, making them self-sufficient.
