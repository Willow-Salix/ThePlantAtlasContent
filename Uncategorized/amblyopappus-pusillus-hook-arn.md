| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal regions of California (USA), Baja California (Mexico), Chile, and Peru. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate / Coastal Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily). It thrives in open, unshaded environments typical of coastal bluffs and scrublands. |
| **💧 Water** | Very drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply during the active growing season (typically cooler months), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly or cease entirely during hot, dry summer dormancy. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dwarf Coastweed is a highly drought-tolerant plant best suited for full sun exposure and well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its native coastal Mediterranean and arid scrubland habitats. It thrives with infrequent watering and requires minimal fertilization, making it an excellent low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils, this plant requires minimal to no fertilization. If desired, a very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once during the active growth period.
