## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, and a small coastal area of Sonora, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland (Sonoran Desert subtype) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires direct, intense sunlight for most of the day, mimicking its open desert habitat. |
| **Watering** | Extremely infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely for extended periods between waterings. Highly susceptible to rot with overwatering, especially during dormancy. |

## Introduction
Fouquieria is a genus of 11 species of desert flowering plants, the sole genus in the family Fouquieriaceae. The genus is native to North America and includes the ocotillo (F. splendens) and the Boojum tree or cirio (F. columnaris). They have semi succulent stems with thinner spikes projecting from them, with leaves on the bases of the spikes. They are unrelated to cacti and do not look much like them; their stems are proportionately thinner than cactus stems and their leaves are larger.

## Care Guide
The Boojum Tree thrives in full, direct sun and requires minimal watering, as it is highly adapted to arid desert conditions. Ensure excellent drainage and allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. It has very low nutrient demands, making frequent fertilization unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. If desired, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once or twice during its active growing period.
