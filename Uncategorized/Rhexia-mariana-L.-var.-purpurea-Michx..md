## Care Guide
Maryland Meadowbeauty flourishes in full sun and consistently moist, acidic soils, mimicking its native bog and pine barren environments. It is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, so avoid rich soils and heavy fertilization. Ensure diligent watering to maintain consistently wet soil without waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. If fertilized, use a very dilute, acid-forming fertilizer sparingly.
