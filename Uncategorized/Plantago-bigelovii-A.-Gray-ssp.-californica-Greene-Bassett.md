## Introduction
Plantago is a genus of about 200 species of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae, commonly called plantains or fleaworts. The common name plantain is shared with the unrelated cooking plantain. Most are herbaceous plants, though a few are subshrubs growing to 60 centimetres (24 inches) tall.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its native coastal grasslands and scrub. It requires moderate watering during its active growth period but is highly drought-tolerant once established, accustomed to dry Mediterranean summers. Fertilization is rarely needed as it adapts well to average to poor soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to None; thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization.
