## Care Guide
This California native thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering once established, reflecting its adaptation to arid and chaparral environments. Minimal fertilization is needed.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soil. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release formula in spring.
