## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern and south-central United States (e.g., Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat of open woodlands, clearings, and prairies, it receives ample direct sunlight for much of the day, suggesting a need for at least 6 hours of direct sun for optimal growth and flowering, but tolerating some afternoon shade. |
| **Watering** | Native to regions with moderate to high rainfall, this plant thrives in average to consistently moist soil. It can tolerate some short dry periods once established, but regular watering during prolonged dry spells is beneficial, mimicking the typical precipitation patterns of its native climate. |

## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
Eared Goldenrod thrives in full sun to partial shade, reflecting its native humid subtropical environment with open exposures. It prefers average to consistently moist soil but demonstrates good drought tolerance once established. This is a low-maintenance plant requiring minimal fertilization, often benefiting most from natural soil amendments.

### Fertilizer
Found in a variety of soils, often in disturbed areas or natural settings with varying fertility. It is generally not a heavy feeder; average soil fertility is sufficient. An annual application of compost or a light, balanced fertilizer in spring is usually adequate, but often not essential in healthy garden soils.
