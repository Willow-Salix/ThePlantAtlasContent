## Introduction
Aristolochia (English: ) is a large plant genus with over 500 species that is the type genus of the family Aristolochiaceae. Its members are commonly known as birthwort, pipevine or Dutchman's pipe and are widespread and occur in the most diverse climates. Some species, like A. utriformis and A. westlandii, are threatened with extinction.
The genus Isotrema is usually included here as Aristolochia subgenus Siphisia, but might be a valid genus. It contains the species with a three-lobed calyx.

## Care Guide
To mimic its tropical dry forest origin, provide bright indirect light to partial sun and ensure thorough watering during active growth, allowing the soil to dry between sessions. Fertilize moderately during its growing season to support its vigorous vine growth and unique blooms. Protect from extended periods of drought or excessive wetness.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize monthly with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer).
