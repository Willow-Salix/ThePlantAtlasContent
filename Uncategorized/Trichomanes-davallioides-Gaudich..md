## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pacific Islands (e.g., Hawaii, Samoa, Fiji), parts of Southeast Asia and Oceania |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light; prefers deep shade or highly indirect light, mimicking its natural habitat on the forest floor or as an epiphyte under dense canopy. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and a constantly moist, but not waterlogged, growing medium. Frequent misting or cultivation in a terrarium is essential; never allow to dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Kinilaw (pronounced [kɪnɪˈlaʊ] or [kɪˈnɪlaʊ], literally "eaten raw") is a raw seafood dish and preparation method native to the Philippines. It is more accurately a cooking process that relies on vinegar and acidic fruit juices (usually citrus) to denature the ingredients, rather than a dish, as it can also be used to prepare meat and vegetables. Kinilaw dishes are usually eaten as appetizers before a meal, or as finger food (Tagalog: pulutan) with alcoholic drinks. Kinilaw is also sometimes called kilawin, especially in the northern Philippines, but the term kilawin more commonly applies to a similar lightly grilled meat dish.

## Care Guide
This delicate filmy fern thrives in the high humidity and very low, indirect light conditions of its tropical rainforest origin. It demands a consistently moist growing environment and benefits greatly from high ambient humidity, making it an ideal candidate for terrariums. Fertilization should be minimal, using a highly diluted solution.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder; use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/8 strength) very sparingly, perhaps once or twice during the growing season, or incorporate slow-release organic matter.
