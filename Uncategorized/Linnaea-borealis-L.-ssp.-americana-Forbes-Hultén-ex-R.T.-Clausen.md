## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern North America, including Canada, Alaska, and northern United States (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Great Lakes region, New England) |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest, Boreal Forest/Taiga (often subalpine or montane understories) |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial to full shade, thriving in the filtered light of a forest understory. Avoid direct, intense sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking its native habitat's cool, damp forest floors. Do not allow the soil to dry out. |

## Introduction
Linnaea borealis is a species of flowering plant in the family Caprifoliaceae (the honeysuckle family). It is the only species in the genus Linnaea. It is a boreal to subarctic woodland subshrub, commonly known as twinflower (sometimes written twin flower).
This plant was a favourite of Carl Linnaeus, founder of the modern system of binomial nomenclature, after whom the genus was named.

## Care Guide
Twinflower thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, replicating its native forest understory. Ensure consistently moist soil and provide partial to full shade to mimic its natural habitat. It appreciates organic-rich soil and may benefit from light, balanced fertilization in spring.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in nutrient-rich, organic soil; light fertilization with a balanced organic fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring if soil is poor.
