*Gossypianthus lanuginosus (Poir.) Moq. var. sheldonii Uline & Bray* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Cuba, Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Shrubland/Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during active growth, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce frequency significantly during dormant or cooler periods to prevent rot. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright, sunny conditions and well-draining soil, adapting to environments with distinct wet and dry seasons. Water moderately during active growth, ensuring the soil dries out between waterings, and reduce frequency during dormant periods. It has low fertilizer requirements, preferring leaner soils over rich, heavily fed environments.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is generally sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich, well-draining soil.
