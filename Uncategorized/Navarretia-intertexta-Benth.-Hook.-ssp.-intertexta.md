## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (primarily California, Oregon, and Washington, USA) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Vernal Pool/Seasonally Wet Grassland) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently wet or even submerged during its active growing season (winter/spring) to mimic vernal pool conditions; allow to dry completely during the dormant summer and fall. |

## Introduction
Navarretia is a genus of flowering plants related to the phloxes and the gilias. This is one genus of plants, among others, which are sometimes called pincushion plants. It includes 45 species native to the Americas. In North America they range from western Canada through the western and west-central United States to northwestern Mexico, and to Ohio and Pennsylvania. In South America they range through Argentina and Chile.
The inflorescence which bears the flowers is surrounded by frilly green bracts bearing soft spines, giving it the appearance of a pincushion. Several species are members of the vernal pool ecosystem.

## Care Guide
This annual thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet to submerged conditions during its winter and spring active growth phase, mirroring its native vernal pool habitat. It needs a dry period during the summer and fall dormancy. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to low-nutrient soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. These plants are adapted to the typically nutrient-poor soils of vernal pools; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
