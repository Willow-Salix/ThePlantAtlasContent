## Care Guide
Lichinella lichens thrive in bright, dry conditions, mirroring their native arid environments. Provide full to partial sun and ensure extremely infrequent watering, allowing for complete desiccation between any hydration. Avoid all traditional fertilizers, as they are harmful to lichens.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Lichens derive nutrients from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust) and the substrate; traditional fertilizers are detrimental.
