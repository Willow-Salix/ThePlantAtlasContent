## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and demands consistently moist to wet soil, reflecting its natural riparian habitat where water is abundant. While adaptable, ensuring ample water, especially during warm periods, is crucial for its vigorous growth, with moderate fertilization supporting overall health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied in early spring, though plants in rich soil may require less.
