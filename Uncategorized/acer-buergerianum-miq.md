## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Trident Maple thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting its native temperate forest environment. Regular watering during the growing season and moderate fertilization in spring will support its robust growth and health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, or a liquid feed monthly from spring to mid-summer. Avoid fertilizing in late summer or fall.
