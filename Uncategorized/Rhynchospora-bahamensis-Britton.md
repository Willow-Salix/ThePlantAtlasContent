## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Bahamas |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Wetlands / Pine Barrens |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) given its natural occurrence in open, unshaded wet areas. |
| **💧 Water** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. Should never be allowed to dry out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Bahama Beaksedge thrives in full sun and demands consistently wet to moist soil conditions, emulating its native wetland habitats. High humidity is also beneficial for its growth. Fertilization should be minimal, using a diluted, balanced solution only during its active growing period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typical wetland and pine barren soils are often nutrient-poor. A diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season, or incorporation of organic matter, is usually sufficient.
