## Care Guide
Possumhaw thrives in constantly moist to wet soil, making it ideal for rain gardens or wet areas, and prefers a location with full sun to partial shade. Ensure it receives consistent moisture and is planted in organically rich soil to mimic its native wetland habitat, with minimal fertilization needed once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from organically rich soil; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil is poor.
