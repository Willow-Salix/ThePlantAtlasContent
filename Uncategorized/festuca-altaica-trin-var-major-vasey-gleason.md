## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including mountainous regions of the western U.S. (e.g., Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, Washington) and western Canada (e.g., British Columbia, Alberta). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine to montane grasslands, meadows, and open coniferous forests. Characterized by cold, snowy winters and mild to moderate summers with seasonal precipitation. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Naturally found in open high-elevation sites or as understory in sparse forest, indicating adaptability to varied light levels but preferring ample light. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate. Prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil, tolerating short dry spells typical of its native mountainous habitat. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mimic its native subalpine habitat by providing full to partial sun and well-drained, moderately moist soil. This hardy grass prefers lean conditions, so fertilize sparingly if at all. Ensure good air circulation to prevent issues in its temperate mountain environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in leaner, rocky soils; excessive fertilization can harm natural growth patterns.
