## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Aleutian Islands, coastal Alaska, Kamchatka Peninsula, Kuril Islands, Sakhalin, northern Japan |
| **Climate** | Subarctic Oceanic Climate, Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers brighter conditions in cooler climates, but may benefit from partial shade in regions with intense summer sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, but excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot. Mimic frequent precipitation (rain, fog) with rapid runoff; do not allow soil to become waterlogged. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
The Unalaska Saxifrage thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained environments characteristic of subarctic alpine and coastal regions. Provide full sun to partial shade, consistent moisture without waterlogging, and ensure excellent drainage in lean, rocky soil. Avoid rich fertilizers and excessive heat.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in lean, rocky, nutrient-poor soils. Minimal to no fertilization is typically needed; if desired, apply a very dilute, balanced liquid feed once in early spring.
