# Ditremis sanfordensis

*Ditremis sanfordensis (Zahlbr.) R.C. Harris* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern USA (e.g., Florida) and Neotropics (e.g., Caribbean, Central America) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Humid Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to filtered light; avoids direct, intense sunlight, typical of a forest understory or canopy protection. |
| **Watering** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and frequent wetting from rain or mist; sensitive to prolonged dry periods, as it absorbs moisture directly from the environment. |

## Care Guide
As an epiphytic lichen, Ditremis sanfordensis thrives in the high humidity and filtered light characteristic of its native subtropical and tropical forest habitats. It requires consistent moisture from its environment, such as mist or rain, and does not need traditional fertilization, deriving nutrients from the air and substrate.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens obtain necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition, rainwater, and the substrate they grow on, rather than soil or applied fertilizers.
