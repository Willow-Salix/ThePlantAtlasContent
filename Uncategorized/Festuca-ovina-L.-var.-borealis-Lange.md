## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Europe (Fennoscandia), Greenland, Iceland, and other circumpolar subarctic regions. |
| **Climate** | Subarctic/Boreal |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, exposed areas with high light intensity during the growing season. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Tolerant of drier conditions once established, reflecting its adaptation to well-drained subarctic soils. |

## Introduction
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## Care Guide
This hardy subarctic grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, tolerating dry conditions once established. It requires minimal fertilization, adapting well to its naturally nutrient-poor native environment. Avoid overwatering to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to nutrient-poor, often acidic soils; excessive fertilization is generally not needed and can reduce hardiness.
