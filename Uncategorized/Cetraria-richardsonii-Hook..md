## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada), Greenland, Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia), and Northern Asia (e.g., Siberia) |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright indirect light; thrives in open, exposed conditions. |
| **Watering** | Absorbs moisture directly from air and precipitation (rain, snowmelt); tolerates dry periods but benefits from high humidity and occasional moisture. |

## Introduction
Cetraria is a genus of fruticose lichens that associate with green algae as photobionts. Most species are found at high latitudes, occurring on sand or heath, and are characterised by their "strap-like" form with spiny lobe edges. The lobes can range from narrow and linear to broader and flattened, often forming loose or densely packed cushions. Their distinctive spiny margins serve both a defensive role and aid in vegetative reproduction through fragmentation. The genus was created by Erik Acharius in 1803 and belongs to the large family Parmeliaceae. While originally a species-rich genus, taxonomic revisions since the 1960s have split many species into new genera, though the exact circumscription remains debated among lichenologists.
Several Cetraria species have cultural and economic importance, particularly C. islandica (Iceland moss), which has been widely used in European traditional medicine for treating digestive and respiratory ailments. This species was also historically important as a famine food in Northern Europe and continues to find applications in modern cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Cetraria species are also ecologically important, serving as indicators of air quality and climate change due to their sensitivity to environmental conditions and ability to accumulate various elements, including potentially toxic heavy metals and radioactive isotopes.

## Care Guide
This arctic lichen thrives in high light and extreme cold, requiring high ambient humidity and occasional moisture from precipitation. It is highly adapted to nutrient-poor environments and does not need traditional fertilization or soil.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; nutrients are absorbed from the air and environment, not from soil.
