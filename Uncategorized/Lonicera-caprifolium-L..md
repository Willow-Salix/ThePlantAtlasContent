## Introduction
Honeysuckles are arching shrubs or twining vines in the genus Lonicera () of the family Caprifoliaceae. The genus includes 158 species native to northern latitudes in North America, Eurasia, and North Africa. Widely known species include Lonicera periclymenum (common honeysuckle or woodbine), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle, white honeysuckle, or Chinese honeysuckle) and Lonicera sempervirens (coral honeysuckle, trumpet honeysuckle, or woodbine honeysuckle). L. japonica is a highly invasive species considered a significant pest in parts of North America, Europe, South America, New Zealand, Australia, and Africa.
Some species are highly fragrant and colorful, so are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. In North America, hummingbirds are attracted to the flowers, especially L. sempervirens and L. ciliosa (orange honeysuckle). Honeysuckle derives its name from the edible sweet nectar obtainable from its tubular flowers. The name Lonicera stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist.

## Care Guide
Italian Woodbine is a versatile climber that adapts well to various light conditions from partial shade to full sun, though it appreciates afternoon shade in warmer regions. It requires moderate, consistent watering, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged. A light application of balanced fertilizer or compost in spring supports its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or organic compost applied in early spring.
