## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas (e.g., Florida, Caribbean, Central and South America), Africa, Asia, and Australia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forests, often found in shaded, humid environments near water sources like stream banks or swamps. |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium light; thrives in indirect or filtered light, typical of a forest understory. Avoid direct, harsh sunlight which can scorch fronds. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil is essential, reflecting its native habitat near water. Water regularly, ensuring the soil never dries out completely, especially during warmer months. High ambient humidity is also beneficial. |

## Introduction
Thelypteris (maiden ferns) is a genus of ferns in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, family Thelypteridaceae, order Polypodiales. Two radically different circumscriptions of the genus are in use as of January 2020. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the genus is a very small one with about two species. In other approaches, the genus is the only one in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, and so includes between 875 and 1083 species.
The genus name is from Greek thēlys "female" and pteris "fern". However, "female fern" usually refers to the common lady-fern.

## Care Guide
To mimic its tropical forest floor origins, provide this fern with consistent moisture, high humidity, and filtered, indirect light. Ensure the soil remains moist but not waterlogged, and protect it from direct sun exposure for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half or quarter strength, once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer). Excessive fertilization can harm ferns.
