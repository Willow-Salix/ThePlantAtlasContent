## 🧤 Care Instructions
Peck's phlox thrives in conditions mimicking its native alpine habitat, requiring full sun and exceptionally well-draining, lean soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and avoid rich soils or excessive moisture to prevent issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; use a very lean, well-draining soil and avoid over-fertilization, which can harm it.
