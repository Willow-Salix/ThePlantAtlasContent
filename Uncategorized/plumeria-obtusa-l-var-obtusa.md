## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | West Indies (Caribbean islands), parts of Central America and northern South America (e.g., Venezuela) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical, often coastal, characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and abundant flowering, reflecting its natural habitat in open, sunny coastal areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Water thoroughly when the top few inches of soil are dry during the active growing season (warm months). Significantly reduce watering or cease completely during cooler, dormant periods to prevent root rot, mimicking its native dry season. |

## 🌱 Overview
Plumeria (), also known as frangipani, is a genus of flowering plants in the subfamily Rauvolfioideae, of the family Apocynaceae. Most species are deciduous shrubs or small trees. The species are native to the Neotropical realm (in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, and as far south as Brazil and as far north as Florida in the United States), but are often grown as cosmopolitan ornamentals in tropical regions, especially in Hawaii, as well as hot desert climates in the Arabian Peninsula with proper irrigation.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native coastal environment. Water generously during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. During dormancy, reduce watering significantly to prevent root rot, ensuring proper care for its seasonal cycle.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced or high-phosphorus fertilizer during the spring and summer actively growing season to support flowering, as native soils may vary in nutrient richness.
