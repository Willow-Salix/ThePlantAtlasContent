## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cultivation is extremely challenging outside of its native habitat, as Conopholis americana is an obligate holoparasite requiring a host tree, typically an oak, for survival. It thrives in the partial to full shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil characteristic of a temperate deciduous forest understory.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No direct fertilizer is required or beneficial, as this plant is an obligate holoparasite that obtains all its nutrients and water from the roots of its host trees, primarily oaks.
