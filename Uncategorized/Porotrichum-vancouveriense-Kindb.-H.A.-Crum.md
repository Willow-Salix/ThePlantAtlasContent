# Vancouver Porotrichum Moss

*Porotrichum vancouveriense (Kindb.) H.A. Crum* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pacific Northwest of North America (including British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate, indirect light. Thrives in shaded or partially shaded environments, mimicking its natural understory habitat. |
| **Watering** | High and consistent moisture. Requires frequent watering or misting to keep the substrate consistently damp but not waterlogged, mimicking its native habitat near streams and in humid forests. High humidity is crucial. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate rainforest environment. Provide low to moderate, indirect light and maintain consistently high humidity and moisture levels. Avoid direct sun and ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, as fertilization is typically unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses generally do not require supplemental fertilization. If desired, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer could be sparingly applied, but it's usually not needed.
