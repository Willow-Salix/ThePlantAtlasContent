## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caribbean Islands (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Leeward Islands, Windward Islands) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. As it's found on cliffs and along streams, it tolerates brighter conditions than deep forest understory. |
| **Watering** | Regular and consistent watering, ensuring the substrate drains very well to prevent waterlogging. Mimic the frequent rainfall of its native habitat, but allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Pitcairnia is a genus of plants in the family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Pitcairnioideae. It was named after William Pitcairn, Scottish physician and gardener (1711–1791). Pitcairnia ranks as the second most species-rich genus in the family Bromeliaceae, after Tillandsia. They are most abundant in Colombia, Peru and Brazil, but can also be found in areas from Cuba and Mexico south to Argentina. One species, Pitcairnia feliciana, is found in tropical West Africa, and is the only member of the family Bromeliaceae not native to the Americas.
Almost all Pitcairnias are terrestrial or saxicolous, and prefer moist areas. However, many are found growing epiphytically in trees.

## Care Guide
Provide bright indirect to partial sun and maintain high humidity, typical of its montane rainforest origin. Water regularly, ensuring excellent drainage, and use a well-draining potting mix. Fertilize lightly during the growing season.

### Fertilizer
Infrequent and diluted liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer). Its native environment on cliffs and stream banks suggests it is adapted to lower nutrient levels.
