## Introduction
Amblystegiaceae is a family of mosses. It includes 20 to 30 genera with a total of up to 150 species. They occur nearly worldwide, growing in tropical, temperate, and subpolar regions.
These mosses are small to large in size and are yellow, green, or brown in color. Some are aquatic and some terrestrial. Most occur in wet habitat types. Many occur in substrates with a basic pH, but some grow in neutral to acidic substrates.

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in consistently cold, oxygenated water and low to partial light conditions, mimicking its natural habitat in mountain streams. It requires constant moisture and should never be allowed to dry out. Nutrient needs are minimal, making it a low-maintenance choice for appropriate aquatic or terrarium setups.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; excess fertilization can be detrimental.
