## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
This plant is well-suited for dry, sunny locations, reflecting its origins in temperate semi-arid grasslands. It demands full sun exposure and is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering. Its low nutrient needs mean it flourishes in average to poor soils with minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Typically thrives in poor to average soils without supplemental fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once annually if growth appears stunted.
