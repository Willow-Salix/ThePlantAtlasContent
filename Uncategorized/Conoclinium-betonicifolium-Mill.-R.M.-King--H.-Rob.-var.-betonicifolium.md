## Introduction
Conoclinium, the mistflowers, is a genus of four species of herbaceous perennial flowering plants, native to North America. They are 0.5 to 2 metres (1.6 to 6.6 ft) tall, and have blue to purple or violet flowers (occasionally white).
The plants of this genus have sometimes been classified in the genus Eupatorium, but late 20th century research shows they are more closely related to other plants of the Eupatorieae, such as Ageratum.
The generic name is derived from the Greek words κῶνος (kônos), meaning "cone", and κλινίον (kliníon), meaning "little bed".

## Care Guide
Thriving in its native humid subtropical climate, this plant requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and a balance of sun exposure, ranging from full sun to partial shade. Ensure regular watering and provide moderate fertilization during its active growth period to encourage healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer.
