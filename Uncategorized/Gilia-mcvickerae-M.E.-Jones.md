## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure, typical of its native open, unshaded desert and scrubland habitats. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Mimic infrequent, deep desert rainfall. |

## Introduction
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## Care Guide
McVicker's Gilia thrives in full sun and well-draining, nutrient-poor soil, mirroring its arid native environment. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing to ensure optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Fertilize very lightly, if at all, during the growing season.
