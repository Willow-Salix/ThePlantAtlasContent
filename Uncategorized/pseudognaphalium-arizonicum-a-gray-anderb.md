| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (including Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado) and northern Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Montane Scrubland and Woodlands. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun exposure, indicative of its natural open habitats. Can tolerate some partial shade, especially in the hottest parts of its range. |
| **💧 Water** | Highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering should be avoided. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Arizona Cudweed is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and dry conditions, replicating its arid montane origins. It is highly drought-tolerant and should be watered infrequently, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry out between waterings. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as it is adapted to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires minimal to no fertilizer. Its native soils are often lean. If growth appears stunted in very poor soil, a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
