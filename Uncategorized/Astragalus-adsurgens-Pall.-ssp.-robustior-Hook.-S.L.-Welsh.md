## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant legume thrives in full sun, reflecting its native habitat in the open grasslands and montane regions of western North America. It requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and generally needs minimal to no supplemental fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to No Fertilizer, especially nitrogen, as legumes fix their own nitrogen and thrive in lean to moderately fertile soils.
