## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Andean regions of South America, primarily Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in low to medium indirect light, mimicking the understory or shaded rock crevices of its native habitat. Direct sunlight will scorch its fronds. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, but must not be waterlogged, reflecting the high rainfall and humidity of its native montane forests. High ambient humidity is crucial; regular misting or a pebble tray is beneficial. |

## Introduction
Pecluma is a genus of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae, subfamily Polypodioideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). They are called rockcap ferns.

## Care Guide
The Colombian Rockcap Fern thrives in conditions that mimic its tropical montane wet forest origins, requiring consistent moisture and high humidity. Provide low to medium indirect light and fertilize lightly to ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize sparingly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a half-strength, balanced liquid fertilizer. In its natural environment, it obtains nutrients from decaying organic matter in rock crevices, which is not a highly rich medium.
