## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Contra Costa County, California, USA (endemic to the Mount Diablo area and surrounding hills) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Grasslands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers open, sunny locations. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent to moderate during its active growth period (winter/spring); requires very low to no water during its summer dormancy, as it is adapted to dry summers. |

## Introduction
Cordylanthus (lit. 'club-flower'), commonly known as bird's beaks, is a genus of parasitic plants in the broomrape family, Orobanchaceae. These western North American natives are sparse, weedy-looking annuals with long branching erect stems and little foliage, and many bear bird's-beak–shaped flowers. They are remarkable among the broomrapes for growing at searing temperatures in arid climates.

## Care Guide
This rare annual thrives in full sun and well-draining, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its native Mediterranean chaparral habitat. Provide infrequent to moderate water only during its winter/spring growing season, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and cease watering during its summer dormancy. Due to its adaptation to harsh conditions and hemiparasitic nature, avoid rich fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; thrives in nutrient-poor, well-draining soils, typically serpentine. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental due to its adaptation to harsh soils and hemiparasitic nature.
