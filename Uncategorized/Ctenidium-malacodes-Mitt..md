## Care Guide
This moss thrives in environments mimicking its native humid forest floor, requiring consistently moist conditions, high humidity, and indirect, low light. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, as it naturally subsists on very few nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs; fertilization is generally unnecessary. If desired, use a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer extremely sparingly.
