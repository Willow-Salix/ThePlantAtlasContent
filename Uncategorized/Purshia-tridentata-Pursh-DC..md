## Care Guide
Antelope Bitterbrush thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, preferring infrequent, deep watering once established. It requires minimal fertilizer, adapting well to the poor soil conditions typical of its native arid and montane scrubland habitats.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required, as it is adapted to poor, nutrient-deficient soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
