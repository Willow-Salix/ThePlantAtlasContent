## Care Guide
Sweet Everlasting prefers a temperate climate with full sun to partial shade and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. It is adapted to less fertile soils, thus requiring minimal fertilization. Overall, it's a hardy plant suited for naturalized areas or gardens mimicking its native open woodland/field environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. This plant often grows in disturbed or less fertile soils (like pine barrens), suggesting it does not require rich soil and may be sensitive to excessive nutrients.
