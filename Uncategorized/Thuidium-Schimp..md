## Care Guide
Thuidium moss thrives in cool, humid, and shaded environments, mimicking its forest floor origins. It requires consistent moisture and high ambient humidity, making frequent watering or misting essential. Fertilization should be minimal to non-existent due to its low nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs, and over-fertilization can be detrimental. A highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly, if at all.
