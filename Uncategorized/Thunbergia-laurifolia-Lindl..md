## Introduction
Thunbergia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It includes 150 species native to tropical and subtropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, southern Asia, New Guinea, and Australia. Thunbergia species are vigorous annual or perennial vines and shrubs growing to 2–8 m tall. The generic name honours the Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg (1743-1828).
Its members are known by various names, including thunbergias and clockvine. Thunbergia on its own usually refers to Thunbergia grandiflora, while Thunbergia alata is often known as black-eyed Susan vine or just black-eyed Susan (not to be confused with other flowers called black-eyed Susan). Orange clockvine is the name of Thunbergia gregorii.
Thunbergias are frequent garden escapes, becoming invasive species; T. grandiflora, T. fragrans, and T. laurifolia are considered weeds in Australia.

## Care Guide
Originating from the tropical monsoon and rainforests of Asia, Laurel Clockvine requires a warm, humid environment with bright light to full sun. It needs consistently moist, well-draining soil and regular feeding during its active growth to support its vigorous climbing and abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding during its active growing season (spring through summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks. Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
