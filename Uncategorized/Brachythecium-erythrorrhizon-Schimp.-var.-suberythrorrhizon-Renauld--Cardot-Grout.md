## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (temperate to boreal forest regions, including parts of Canada and Northern USA) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest / Boreal Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to partial shade. Prefers indirect, dappled light, typical of a forest floor under a canopy. Avoid direct harsh sunlight which can quickly dry and damage it. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist substrate and high ambient humidity are crucial. Requires regular misting or placement in a terrarium/humid environment to prevent drying. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to rot. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and highly humid environments with low to partial light, mimicking its native forest floor habitat. Ensure good drainage to prevent rot and avoid direct sun and excessive fertilization to maintain its delicate growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses obtain nutrients from their environment and are sensitive to high salt concentrations. If absolutely necessary, use an extremely diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very infrequently.
