## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe and North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to partial shade, mimicking the understory or shaded bark environment of temperate forests. Avoid direct, harsh sunlight. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and consistent moisture, similar to the damp conditions found in ancient woodlands. Regular misting is crucial; avoid complete drying out. |

## Introduction
Bacidia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. These lichens are characterised by their crustose growth form, distinctive club-shaped reproductive structures called apothecia that contain long, needle-like spores, and their symbiotic partnership with green algae. Bacidia species typically grow on various substrates including tree bark, rock surfaces, and occasionally soil, and are distinguished from related genera by their specific spore characteristics and internal structures.

## Care Guide
Bacidia chlorococca thrives in high humidity and consistent moisture, preferring indirect light or partial shade. It requires a stable, damp environment, typically found on the bark of deciduous trees in temperate forests. Traditional fertilization is not needed as lichens acquire nutrients from the atmosphere and substrate.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. As a lichen, it obtains necessary nutrients from the air, rainwater, and its substrate rather than traditional fertilization.
