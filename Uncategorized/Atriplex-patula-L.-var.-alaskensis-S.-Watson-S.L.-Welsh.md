## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions of Alaska, North America |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate to Subarctic Coastal (shorelines, salt marshes, disturbed ground) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it naturally occurs in open, exposed coastal environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent moisture; tolerates occasional dry spells once established, reflecting its habitat near fluctuating water sources. |

## Introduction
Atriplex () is a plant genus of about 250 species, known by the common names of saltbush and orache (; also spelled orach). It belongs to the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae s.l.. 
The genus is quite variable and widely distributed. It includes many desert and seashore plants and halophytes, as well as plants of moist environments. 
The generic name originated in Latin and was applied by Pliny the Elder to the edible oraches. The name saltbush derives from the fact that the plants retain salt in their leaves; they are able to grow in areas affected by soil salination.

## Care Guide
This Orache variety thrives in full sun and prefers cool, temperate to subarctic coastal conditions. It requires moderate, consistent moisture but can endure occasional dry periods. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its adaptation to harsh, nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor or challenging saline soils often found in its native coastal habitats.
