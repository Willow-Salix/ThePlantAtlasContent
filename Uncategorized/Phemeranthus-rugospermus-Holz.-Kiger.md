| **Native Origin** | Central and Southeastern United States |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and flowering. |

## Introduction
Phemeranthus (fameflower) is a genus of flowering plants in the miner's lettuce family, Montiaceae, native to the Americas. It was formerly placed in Portulacaceae. The name is derived from the Greek words εφήμερος (ephemeros), meaning "living for one day," and ἄνθος (anthos), meaning "flower." Common names for the various species are often fame flower, rock rose, rock pink, and sand pink.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil, mirroring its native prairie and rocky glade habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering, and prefers lean to moderately fertile conditions rather than heavy feeding.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization can reduce flowering; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth is poor.
