| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, thrives in full sun during its active growth period. |
| **💧 Water** | High moisture during its active growth and flowering season (wet winters/springs), followed by a dry period as it completes its life cycle and senesces. Mimic seasonal inundation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Limnanthes, the type genus of the family Limnanthaceae, consists of annual herbaceous plants commonly known as the meadowfoams. The seven species are all native to coastal and adjoining regions (inland valleys, foothills and mountains) of western North America, where they typically grow in marshy habitats, such as the margins of vernal pools. Some are endemic to California.
General form ranges from decumbent to erect, with leaves either pinnately lobed or compound; the lobes or leaflets may themselves range from entire to deeply lobed. Both 4- and 5-sepaled and petaled members are known.
The white meadowfoam Limnanthes alba is of commercial interest for its oil, while several other species are rare or endangered. Honey produced by bees that pollinate Limnanthes alba has the distinct flavor of toasted marshmallows.
L. douglasii is widely cultivated as a hardy annual, its white and yellow flower colour giving it the common name of poached egg plant.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This annual plant requires full sun and consistently high moisture during its spring growth and flowering period, simulating its native vernal pool conditions. Once flowering ends, allow the soil to dry completely as the plant enters dormancy. Fertilization should be kept minimal to moderate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it's adapted to the nutrient conditions of vernal pool environments, which are often not rich. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
