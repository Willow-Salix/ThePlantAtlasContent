## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
This Goldenrod thrives in full to partial sun with well-drained, sandy soil, mirroring its native pine woodland habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low; native to nutrient-poor sandy soils, so minimal or no fertilization is typically needed.
