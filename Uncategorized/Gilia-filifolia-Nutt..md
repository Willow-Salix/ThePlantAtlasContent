## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (primarily California and Baja California) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; prefers dry conditions, tolerating drought once established. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings, especially during warmer months. |

## Introduction
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## Care Guide
Threadleaf Gilia requires full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native arid scrubland habitat. It is drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering once established, and generally does not require fertilization. Provide ample sunlight and minimize supplemental water for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
