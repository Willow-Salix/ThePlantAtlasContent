| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Sierra Nevada mountains, Tehachapi Mountains, and Coast Ranges of California, USA. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Montane and Foothill regions) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to light partial shade, appreciating some afternoon shade in hotter inland areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during its active growth phase (typically winter and spring), allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established; significantly reduce or cease watering during dry summer dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native thrives in well-draining soil with full sun to light shade, adapting to its native Mediterranean climate. Provide regular water during its active growing season in winter/spring, reducing significantly during its summer dormancy. It prefers lean to moderately fertile soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or compost can be applied sparingly in early spring, primarily if soil is very poor.
