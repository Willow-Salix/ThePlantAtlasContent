## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically California and Oregon) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland / Temperate Woodland (Oak Woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating full sun in coastal or milder areas and preferring some afternoon shade in hotter inland regions. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires infrequent, deep watering during extended dry periods, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, especially in winter. |

## Care Guide
Adapted to California's Mediterranean oak woodlands, Rough Hedgenettle thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent deep watering, and generally needs low fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if the soil is particularly lean.
