## Care Guide
This Hawaiian endemic grass thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring watering only when the soil is dry to the touch. Fertilization should be light, supporting its natural growth in native-like conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring, or liquid feed every few months during the growing season.
