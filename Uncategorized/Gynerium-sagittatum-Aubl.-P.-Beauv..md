## Introduction
Gynerium is a monotypic genus of Neotropical plants in the grass family, native to Mexico and Colombia, Central America, South America, and the West Indies. It is classified in its own tribe Gynerieae.
The sole species in the genus is Gynerium sagittatum, a tall grass that grows up to six metres (twenty feet) high. It is a very vigorous species that grows into a considerably dense mass of vegetation. The species is known as "cana-do-rio", "cana-flecha", "cana-frecha", "ubá" and "cana-brava" in Brazil, "caña brava" in Peru and Colombia, "chuchío" in eastern Bolivia, and "tañil" in Guatemala and other Spanish speaking countries. It is known in English as "wildcane" or "wild cane", while "arrow cane" is less common (sagitta is Latin for arrow).

## Care Guide
This highly water-dependent plant thrives in full sun and consistently wet to waterlogged conditions, mirroring its native riverbank and wetland habitats. Provide ample space for its vigorous growth and regular feeding to support its robust development.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate to high fertilization, especially during active growth, to support its vigorous nature. Use a balanced, nutrient-rich fertilizer.
