## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure, at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, as it thrives in open, exposed desert environments. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant once established; requires infrequent watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Mimic natural desert rainfall patterns with deep, infrequent irrigation. |

## Introduction
Chilopsis is a monotypic genus of flowering plants containing the single species Chilopsis linearis. It is known commonly as desert willow or desert-willow because of its willow-like leaves, but it is not a true willow – being instead a member of the catalpa family.
It is a shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States and Mexico. It is commonly seen in washes and along riverbanks.

## Care Guide
To care for the Desert Willow, provide full sun and mimic its native desert conditions by allowing the soil to dry out completely between infrequent, deep waterings. It thrives in lean soil and requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant adapted to arid environments.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; native desert soils are typically lean. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient for young plants, or none for established ones.
