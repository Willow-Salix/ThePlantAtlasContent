## Care Guide
This wetland native thrives in full sun to partial shade and demands constantly wet, even saturated, soil conditions. Mimic its bog or fen habitat by ensuring excellent moisture retention. Fertilization should be minimal due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor wetland environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; wetland soils, especially peaty ones, can be nutrient-poor. Use a diluted, balanced fertilizer sparingly, if at all, to avoid nutrient burn.
