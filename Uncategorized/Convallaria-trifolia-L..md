| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Boreal (Bogs, Fens, Wet Coniferous Forests) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade, avoiding direct intense sunlight, especially in warmer climates. It naturally grows under tree canopies or in diffuse light in open bogs. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to saturated soil, mimicking its native bog and swamp habitats. It should never be allowed to dry out and appreciates high humidity. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, consistently wet environments with ample shade, replicating its native bog and wet forest habitats. Ensure the soil never dries out and provide only minimal fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season is sufficient, as native bog soils are often nutrient-poor and acidic.
