## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical Asia, including Southeast Asia (e.g., Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines), New Guinea, and parts of Queensland, Australia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforests and Subtropical Moist Forests. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light is ideal. As an understory plant, it should be protected from direct, harsh sunlight which can scorch its leaves. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture. Water thoroughly when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged. High humidity is crucial, so regular misting or a humidifier is beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Alocasia macrorrhizos is a species of flowering plant in the arum family (Araceae) that it is native to rainforests of Maritime Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Queensland and has long been cultivated in South Asia, the Philippines, many Pacific islands, and elsewhere in the tropics.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Alocasia macrorrhiza thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light, mimicking its tropical rainforest home. It needs consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from regular fertilization during active growth. Ensure high humidity to prevent leaf crisping and promote lush foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer), given its rich, organic native soil conditions.
