## Introduction
Cordylanthus (lit. 'club-flower'), commonly known as bird's beaks, is a genus of parasitic plants in the broomrape family, Orobanchaceae. These western North American natives are sparse, weedy-looking annuals with long branching erect stems and little foliage, and many bear bird's-beak–shaped flowers. They are remarkable among the broomrapes for growing at searing temperatures in arid climates.

## Care Guide
The Desert Bird's-Beak requires full sun exposure and very infrequent watering, as it is highly adapted to arid conditions. It thrives in lean, well-draining soil and has minimal fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance plant for desert-like environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in lean, well-draining soils typical of its native desert habitat.
