## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Dry-Summer Subtropical) |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun, but can tolerate partial shade, especially in hotter inland areas. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering during its active growing season and is drought-tolerant once established, preferring drier conditions in summer after flowering. |

## Introduction
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## Care Guide
Dwarf Checkerbloom thrives in a Mediterranean climate, requiring full sun and moderate water, especially during its growing period. Once established, it is drought-tolerant and prefers leaner soils, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry gardens.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in lean to average soils and typically does not require heavy fertilization; a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if growth is poor.
