## 🌱 Overview
Monardella is a genus of approximately 40 species of annual and perennial plants native to western North America from British Columbia to northwestern Mexico. They are grown for their highly aromatic foliage, which in some species is used for herbal teas. The two-lipped, tubular flowers are formed in terminal clusters and are most usually red, pink, or purple.
Monardella is a Latin diminutive form of Monarda (a taxonomic patronym honoring the Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes), which the form of the flower heads resembles.  Plants in this genus are commonly known as wildmints, coyote mints or monardellas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hall's monardella thrives in a Mediterranean climate, requiring full sun and well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, preferring infrequent, deep watering rather than constant moisture, and typically needs little to no fertilization to flourish.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements; if necessary, a very dilute, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring, but typically not needed in native-like conditions.
