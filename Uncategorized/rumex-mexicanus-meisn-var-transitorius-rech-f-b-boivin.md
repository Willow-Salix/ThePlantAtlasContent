## 🌱 Overview
The docks and sorrels, genus Rumex, are a genus of about 200 species of annual, biennial, and perennial herbs in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae.
Members of this genus are very common perennial herbs with a native almost worldwide distribution, and introduced species growing in the few places where the genus is not native.
Some are nuisance weeds (and are sometimes called dockweed or dock weed), but some are grown for their edible leaves. Rumex species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species, and are the only host plants of Lycaena dispar and Lycaena rubidus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mexican Dock thrives in consistently moist soil under full to partial sun exposure. Regular watering is crucial to mimic its native wetland habitats. While not a heavy feeder, a moderate dose of all-purpose fertilizer during active growth will support healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season.
