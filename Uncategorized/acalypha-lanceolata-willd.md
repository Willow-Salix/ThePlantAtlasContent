| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Savanna and Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, adapting to open areas and forest edges in its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Acalypha is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is the sole genus of the subtribe Acalyphinae. It is one of the largest euphorb genera, with approximately 450 to 462 species. The genus name Acalypha is from the Ancient Greek ἀκαλύφη (akalúphē) ("nettle"), an alternative form of ἀκαλήφη (akalḗphē), and was inspired by the nettle-like leaves. General common names include copperleaf and three-seeded mercury. Native North American species are generally inconspicuous most of the year until the fall when their stems and foliage turn a distinctive coppery-red.
The genus is distributed mainly in the tropics and subtropics, with about 60% of species native to the Americas and about 30% in Africa.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lanceleaf Acalypha thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistent, moderate watering during its growing season, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between applications. It benefits from regular, moderate fertilization to support its active growth, mimicking its native habitat in tropical and subtropical grasslands and open woodlands.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer), using a balanced liquid fertilizer bi-weekly to monthly, reflecting the varied soil richness of its natural environment.
