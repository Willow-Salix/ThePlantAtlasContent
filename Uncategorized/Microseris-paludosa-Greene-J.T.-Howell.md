## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central Western California, USA (specifically San Francisco Bay Area, South Coast Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, reflecting its open wetland habitat where it receives ample light but may get some dappled shade from taller grasses or shrubs. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to moist soil; cannot tolerate drying out. Needs frequent watering, potentially daily in warm, dry climates, to mimic its marsh and seep environments. |

## Introduction
Microseris is a genus of plants in the tribe Cichorieae within the family Asteraceae, plants that often called composites. They are native to North America, South America, Australia, and New Zealand.
Plants in the genus can either be annuals or perennials. Perennial plants in Microseris usually have a taproot or a caudex with the exception of Microseris borealis, which is rhizomatous. The leaves are mostly or entirely basal, growing very near the surface of the soil rather than being held on stems above ground level. When blooming the flowers are alone on the top of stems and are held upright when blooming and when producing seeds. The flowers are shades of orange or yellow with a superficial resemblance to dandelions.
There is currently disagreement about which species should be placed in Microseris. Plants of the World Online (POWO) synonymizes genus Nothocalais into Microseris. While the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service PLANTS database (PLANTS), World Flora Online (WFO), the Global Compositae Database (GCD), and Flora of North America (FNA) continue to list Nothocalais as a separate genus as of 2023.
The only species classified by WFO in Nothocalais is Microseris nigrescens as Nothocalais nigrescens, which is also the classification in PLANTS and FNA. The other species classified by PLANTS and FNA as Nothocalais are Microseris alpestris (N. alpestris), Microseris cuspidata (N. cuspidata), and Microseris troximoides (N. troximoides).
According to POWO Microseris contains the following 22 species:

## Care Guide
Marsh Silverpuffs thrive in consistently wet to moist conditions, replicating their native marsh and seep habitats in California. They require full sun to partial shade and benefit from organically rich soil. Ensure the soil never dries out to maintain the health of this rare plant.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, preferring organically rich soil. While native wetland soils can be fertile, excessive fertilization is not recommended for native species. A balanced, diluted feed once or twice during the growing season is likely sufficient if soil is poor.
