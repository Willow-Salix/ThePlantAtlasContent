## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Africa (South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho) and Lord Howe Island |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Grasslands and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers ample bright, direct light for optimal flowering, but tolerates some shade. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during active growth. Tolerates periods of drought once established, reflecting its adaptable native environment. |

## Introduction
Dietes is a genus of six rhizomatous plant species of the iris family Iridaceae, first described collectively in 1866. Common names for the  different species include wood iris, fortnight lily, African iris, Japanese iris and butterfly iris. Globally, these common names may differ from region to region, and may also apply to one or more species within Dietes.
Most of the Dietes are endemic to southern and central Africa; one (Dietes robinsoniana) is native to Lord Howe Island, off the eastern Pacific coast of Australia. A few others—primarily Dietes bicolor, D. grandiflora and D. iridioides—have become popular gardening and  landscaping plants around the world, and have thus inevitably naturalised in areas outside of their natural range, including across much of the Americas, from the United States (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, South Carolina, Southern California and the Bay Area, Texas) through Mexico and much of Central and South America, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Hispaniola and Jamaica. Elsewhere, these species have been documented in the Azores, the Canary Islands, Madeira, southern France, Spain, Portugal, Sicily, Israel, Istanbul, Palestine, Madagascar, Mauritius, Réunion, St. Helena, Hong Kong, Java (Indonesia), Sikkim (India), Singapore, Taiwan, and Tokyo, Japan. They are also found in Australia (near Adelaide and Perth, and much of New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, and Victoria), New Caledonia and New Zealand.

## Care Guide
Dietes thrives in full sun to partial shade with moderate, consistent watering, preferring well-drained soil but tolerating some drought once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, typically a balanced feed in spring to support robust growth and flowering. This resilient plant mimics its native temperate to subtropical environment by adapting to various light and moisture conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in spring, or a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks during its primary growing season.
