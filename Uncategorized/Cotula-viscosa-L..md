## Introduction
Cotula is a genus of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It includes plants known generally as water buttons or buttonweeds.
The species within this genus can vary extensively in their habit, leaf division, involucre, receptacle and achenes. This makes it difficult to define them by comparing their morphology. The genus can only be defined by looking at the corollas of their flowers. Most are disciform (lacking ray florets). These corollas may be tubular, reduced or even absent. Another characteristic is their solitary heads growing on a peduncle.

## Care Guide
Sticky Cotula thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean habitat. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization. This hardy plant is well-adapted to drier conditions once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once or twice during the growing season, or less if the soil is naturally rich.
