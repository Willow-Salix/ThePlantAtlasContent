## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico (Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland (Desert) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure is essential, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its open desert habitat. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant; requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings. Mimic sporadic desert rainfall, avoiding overwatering. |

## Introduction
Fouquieria splendens, commonly known as ocotillo, is a plant indigenous to the Mojave, Sonoran, Chihuahuan and Colorado deserts in the Southwestern United States (southern California, southern Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas), and northern Mexico (as far south as Hidalgo and Guerrero).
Ocotillos look desiccated on the outside, but they are semi-succulent; it is more closely related to the tea plant and blueberries than to cactuses. It regenerates leaves after rainfall. They can be planted as garden ornamentals.

## Care Guide
Ocotillo thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native arid desert environment. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing as it has low nutrient demands. This plant is well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. If desired, a very diluted, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year during its active growing season.
