## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and subtropical regions globally, including Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia. |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate to Subtropical Forests and woodlands, often in sheltered, moist microhabitats. |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade. This lichen thrives in diffused light conditions, mimicking its natural environment under dense forest canopies or in protected, shaded spots, and should be kept away from direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and frequent moisture exposure. Mimic its natural environment by providing regular misting or ensuring a constantly moist (but not waterlogged) substrate, allowing for brief drying periods between wetting cycles. |

## Introduction
Leptogium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Collemataceae. It has about 110 species. Species formerly classified under Leptogium have since been divided among the genera Leptogium, Pseudoleptogium, and Scytinium. Leptogium lichens are predominantly found on tree bark or soil, often among mosses, and sometimes on rocks in moist environments.

## Care Guide
To care for Skin Lichen, prioritize very high humidity and low, indirect light, replicating its native humid forest habitat. Maintain consistent moisture on its substrate and through ambient humidity, while ensuring no direct sun exposure. Avoid all conventional fertilizers, as they are detrimental to this delicate organism.

### Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer requirements. Lichens obtain nutrients from atmospheric dust, rain, and their substrate; conventional fertilizers can be harmful.
