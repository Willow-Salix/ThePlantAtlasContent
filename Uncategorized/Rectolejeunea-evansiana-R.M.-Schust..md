## Care Guide
This delicate liverwort thrives in consistently high humidity, very low light, and perpetually moist conditions. It is best suited for a closed terrarium or paludarium setup where its specific moisture and light requirements can be meticulously met. Avoid direct sunlight and over-fertilization to ensure its survival.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient needs. Avoid regular fertilization; if necessary, apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/10th strength) very sparingly, perhaps once or twice a year.
