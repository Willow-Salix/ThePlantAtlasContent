## Introduction
Bromus is a large genus of grasses, classified in its own tribe Bromeae. They are commonly known as bromes, brome grasses, cheat grasses, or chess grasses. Estimates in the scientific literature of the number of species have ranged from 100 to 400, but plant taxonomists currently recognize around 160–170 species.
Bromus is part of the cool-season grass lineage (subfamily Pooideae), which includes about 3300 species.  Within Pooideae, Bromus is classified in tribe Bromeae (it is the only genus in the tribe).  Bromus is closely related to the wheat-grass lineage (tribe Triticeae) that includes such economically important genera as Triticum (wheat), Hordeum (barley) and Secale (rye).

## Care Guide
Siberian Brome is a hardy temperate grass that thrives in full to partial sun conditions. It requires moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and generally benefits from low to moderate fertilization. This species is well-adapted to continental climates with cold winters and warm summers, tolerating average soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate fertilization. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient.
