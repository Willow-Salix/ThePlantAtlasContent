## 🧤 Care Instructions
Osceola's Plume thrives in the humid subtropical climate of the southeastern US, preferring consistently wet, acidic soils in full to partial sun. Mimic its native bog or wet savanna habitat by ensuring constant moisture and avoiding rich, heavily fertilized soils for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers nutrient-poor to moderately fertile, acidic soil; heavy fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental. Use a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer sparingly if growth appears weak.
