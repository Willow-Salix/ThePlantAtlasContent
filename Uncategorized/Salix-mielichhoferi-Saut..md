## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
Mielichhofer's Willow thrives in cool, moist environments with full sun to partial shade, reflecting its Alpine origins. Ensure the soil remains consistently wet, mimicking its natural habitat near water sources, and provide minimal fertilization in spring.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization in spring; not a heavy feeder, can adapt to nutrient-poor alpine soils.
