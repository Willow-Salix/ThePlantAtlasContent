## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean region (including parts of Southern Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers some afternoon shade in hotter climates to prevent premature bolting and bitterness. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering is essential to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during dry periods. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Rocket, eruca, or arugula (Eruca sativa) is an edible annual plant in the family Brassicaceae used as a leaf vegetable for its fresh, tart, bitter, and peppery flavour. Its other common names include salad rocket and garden rocket (in the UK, Australia, South Africa, Ireland, and New Zealand), as well as colewort, roquette, ruchetta, rucola, rucoli, and rugula. Native to the Mediterranean region, it is widely popular as a salad vegetable.
Some botanists consider it a subspecies of Eruca vesicaria. However, they are different in many morphological aspects, such as sepal persistence, silique shape, and habit. Most importantly, they do not hybridise freely with each other as there is partial reproductive isolation between them. The Plants of the World Online database has accepted Eruca sativa as a distinct species.

## Care Guide
Arugula thrives in conditions similar to its native Mediterranean climate, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistent moisture. Ensure well-draining, fertile soil and regular watering to encourage tender leaf growth and prevent early bolting. Fertilize periodically to maintain vigor and good production.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to fertile soil. Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer every few weeks during its active growing season to support rapid leaf production.
