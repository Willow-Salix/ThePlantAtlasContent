| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (endemic to Northern California counties) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Chaparral, Cismontane Woodland, Valley and Foothill Grassland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open habitat in grasslands and chaparral. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Adaptable to dry conditions, requiring water during its active growing season (late winter/spring) and tolerating drought in summer. Allow soil to dry out between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Milo Baker's cryptantha thrives in conditions mirroring its native Californian Mediterranean climate. Provide full sun exposure and well-draining soil, watering sparingly after establishment to accommodate its drought tolerance during dry periods. Fertilization is generally not required, as it is adapted to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to lean, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer may be applied sparingly in spring if soil is very poor, but often unnecessary.
