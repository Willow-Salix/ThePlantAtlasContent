## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Florida, USA (primarily Everglades and Big Cypress Swamp regions) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Moist Forest (within deeply shaded, high-humidity microhabitats like limestone solution holes) |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light to deep shade. Direct sunlight is highly detrimental and will quickly scorch the fronds. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, but not waterlogged, substrate. High atmospheric humidity (80%+) is absolutely critical; regular misting or enclosure in a terrarium is essential. |

## Introduction
Trichomanes is a genus of ferns in the family Hymenophyllaceae, termed bristle ferns. The circumscription of the genus is disputed. All ferns in the genus are filmy ferns, with leaf tissue typically 2 cells thick.  This thinness generally necessitates a permanently humid habitat, and makes the fronds somewhat translucent. Because of this membrane-like frond tissue, the plant is prone to drying out. "Filmy ferns" in the taxa Hymenophyllaceae grow in constantly wet environments. Many are found in cloud forests such as "Choco" in Colombia. There are also members of the taxa that can grow submersed in water. 
The name bristle fern refers to the small bristle that protrudes from the indusia of these ferns.

## Care Guide
The Dotted Bristle Fern demands conditions mirroring its native Florida microhabitats: very low light, extremely high humidity, and a consistently moist substrate. It is highly sensitive to dry air and direct sun, requiring a terrarium or similar enclosed environment to thrive, with minimal nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Extremely light fertilization, if any. These ferns grow in nutrient-poor environments, so use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 strength or less) very sparingly, or avoid altogether.
