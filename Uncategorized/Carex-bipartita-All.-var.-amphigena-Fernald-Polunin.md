## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Subarctic North America (e.g., Alaska, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Greenland, Labrador, Quebec) |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra / Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (prefers open, exposed conditions typical of tundra environments) |
| **Watering** | High (requires consistently moist to wet soil, especially during its short growing season, mimicking its boggy or wet meadow native habitat) |

## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This arctic/alpine sedge thrives in cool, exposed environments with full sun exposure. It demands consistently moist to wet soil conditions, replicating its native boggy or wet tundra habitat. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low (adapted to nutrient-poor, often acidic soils of arctic and alpine regions, minimal fertilization is needed)
