## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Pacific Northwest, Great Basin) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane to Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, exposed environments typical of mountain slopes and dry grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Drought-tolerant once established, preferring well-drained soil that dries out between waterings. Mimic dry periods common in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Boechera (rockcress) is a genus of the family Brassicaceae. It was named after the Danish botanist Tyge W. Böcher (1909–1983), who was known for his research in alpine plants, including the mustards Draba and Boechera holboellii. According to recent molecular-based studies, Boechera is closely related to the genus Arabidopsis which also includes the widely known model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
Until recently, members of this genus were included in the genus Arabis, but have been separated from that genus based on recent genetic and cytological data. Unlike the genus Arabis (x=8) Boechera has a base chromosome number of x=7. Many taxa are triploid. Boechera is a primarily North American genus, most diverse in the western United States, and its distribution range also includes Greenland and the Russian Far East. The genus is poorly known, and species within are difficult to separate morphologically though some clearly distinct species are known.
Most members of the genus are perennial plants with pubescent leaves with stellate trichomes, narrow curving fruits, and small white to purple flowers in elongated racemes. Relationships within the genus are unclear, and some eastern North American species, including Boechera laevigata, may belong to a clade distinct from the rest of the genus.
A very interesting feature of many species of the genus is asexual reproduction, a process known as apomixis. Microsatellite data has revealed that some of the apomictic lineages are hybrids between two or more sexual parents.

## Care Guide
Secund Rockcress requires full sun and excellent drainage, thriving in conditions that mimic its native dry, rocky mountain slopes. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and keep fertilization to a minimum.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to lean, rocky soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental. A very light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, or none at all, is usually sufficient.
