## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Europe (e.g., Balkan Peninsula, Italy) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Mountainous/Subalpine |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers full sun for best flowering and compact growth, reflecting its exposure in open, rocky habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, mirroring the dry summer periods of its native climate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Alyssum is a genus of over a hundred species of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, native to temperate Europe, Asia, and northern Africa, with the highest species diversity in the Mediterranean region. The genus comprises annual and perennial herbaceous plants or (rarely) small shrubs, growing to 10–100 cm tall, with oblong-oval leaves. Alyssum flowers are characteristically small and grouped in terminal clusters; they are often yellow or white colored but can be pink or purple.
The genera Lobularia, Aurinia and Odontarrhena are closely related to Alyssum and were formerly included in it. The widely cultivated species popularly known as "sweet alyssum" (Alyssum maritimum) is Lobularia maritima. The common rockery plant (Alyssum saxatile) is Aurinia saxatilis.
Alyssum foliage is used as food by the caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera, including the Gem (Orthonama obstipata). However, rabbits will not eat it.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rock Alyssum thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native Mediterranean mountainous regions. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, as it's very drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize sparingly to maintain its natural vigor in poor soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. This plant thrives in lean to poor soils; excessive fertilization can harm it. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is sufficient if needed.
