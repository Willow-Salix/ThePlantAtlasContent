| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (Appalachian Mountains region of Canada and USA) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade. Thrives in the understory of woodlands, protected from direct, intense sun. |

## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Appalachian sedge thrives in partial to full shade, mimicking its native woodland understory. It requires moderate watering to maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, tolerating brief dry periods once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it prefers nutrient levels typical of forest floors.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer. Benefits from a light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring, or amendments with compost to mimic natural woodland soil.
