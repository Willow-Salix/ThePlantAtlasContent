# Jelly Lichen
### *Synechoblastus rupestris (Sw.) Trevis.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Cosmopolitan, found in temperate and boreal regions across Europe, North America, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate and Boreal Climates, common on exposed rocky and calcareous substrates. |
| **☀️ Light** | High exposure; thrives in full sun to partial shade, tolerating intense direct light and UV radiation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires intermittent moisture from rain or dew to rehydrate, followed by dry periods. Highly tolerant of prolonged desiccation. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in exposed, temperate environments with natural cycles of wetting and drying. Provide high light exposure and allow for periods of desiccation between rehydration events from rain or dew. No external fertilization is required as it absorbs nutrients directly from the environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed; obtains essential nutrients directly from atmospheric deposition (dust, precipitation) and the substrate.
