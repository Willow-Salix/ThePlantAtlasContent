## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Asia (including China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Grasslands and Mountain Slopes |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and flowering, though it can tolerate partial shade. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering during the growing season to maintain consistently moist soil, especially when establishing. Once mature, it is drought-tolerant but benefits from supplemental water during prolonged dry periods. |

## Introduction
Miscanthus, or silvergrass, is a genus of African, Eurasian, and Pacific Island plants in the grass family, Poaceae. The name is derived from the Greek words "miskos", meaning "stem", and "anthos", meaning "flower", in reference to the stalked spikelets on plants of this genus. Several species are known for their height and biomass production, and may be used as ornamental grasses.

## Care Guide
Chinese silvergrass is a resilient East Asian ornamental grass that flourishes in full sun and well-drained soil. It requires regular watering during its active growing season to establish, becoming drought-tolerant once mature. Minimal fertilization is needed, as overfeeding can result in weak, leggy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced granular fertilizer in early spring is usually sufficient; excessive nitrogen can lead to floppy growth.
