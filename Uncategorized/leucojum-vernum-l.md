## 🌱 Overview
Leucojum vernum, commonly called the spring snowflake, St. Agnes' flower (for the patron saint of virgins), and rarely snowbell among others, is a species of flowering plant in the family Amaryllidaceae. It is native to central and southern Europe from Belgium to Ukraine. It is considered naturalized in north-western Europe, including Great Britain and parts of Scandinavia, and in the US states of Georgia and Florida. This spring flowering bulbous herbaceous perennial is cultivated as an ornamental for a sunny position. The plant multiplies in favourable conditions to form clumps. Each plant bears a single white flower with greenish marks near the tip of the tepal, on a stem about 10–20 cm (3.9–7.9 in) tall, occasionally more.
The Latin specific epithet vernum means "relating to Spring"; its close relative, Leucojum aestivum, flowers in summer.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Plant in a location that receives full sun in early spring and partial shade during summer. Maintain consistently moist soil during its active growth, allowing it to dry out somewhat during dormancy. Provide rich, well-drained soil with ample organic matter.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, well-drained soil high in organic matter. A balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost can be applied in late autumn or early spring.
