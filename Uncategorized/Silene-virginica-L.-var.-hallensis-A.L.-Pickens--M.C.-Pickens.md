## Care Guide
Fire Pink thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate forest habitat, requiring partial to full sun exposure and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is a relatively low-maintenance plant, benefiting from light fertilization primarily during its active growing season to support vibrant blooming.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring or a diluted liquid feed every 4-6 weeks during active growth is generally sufficient.
