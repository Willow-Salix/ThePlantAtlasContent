## Care Guide
Blue Lawngrass thrives in warm, humid conditions with abundant sunlight. Provide consistent moisture through regular watering, and support its growth with moderate fertilization during active periods. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. Benefits from regular feeding with a balanced fertilizer during its active growing season to support lush growth, as it grows in varied but often nutrient-rich tropical soils.
