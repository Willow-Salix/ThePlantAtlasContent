## Care Guide
The Flowering Almond thrives in temperate environments, preferring full sun for prolific blooms. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil but can withstand periods of drought once established. Fertilize moderately in spring to encourage healthy growth and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Apply a balanced slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring before new growth, or a general-purpose liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.
