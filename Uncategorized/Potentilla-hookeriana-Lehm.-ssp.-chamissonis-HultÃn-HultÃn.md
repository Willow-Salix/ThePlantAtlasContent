## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
Hooker's Cinquefoil is an arctic-alpine plant that requires full to partial sun and well-drained, consistently moist soil during its short growing season. It thrives in cool conditions and is highly adapted to nutrient-poor environments, thus requiring minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; naturally adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
