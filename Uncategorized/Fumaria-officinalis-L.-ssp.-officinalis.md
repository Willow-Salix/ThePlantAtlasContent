## Introduction
Fumaria (fumitory or fumewort, from Latin fumus terrae, "smoke of the earth") is a genus of about 60 species of annual flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. The genus is native to Europe, Africa and Asia, most diverse in the Mediterranean region, and introduced to North, South America and Australia. Fumaria species are sometimes used in herbal medicine. Fumaria indica contains an unusual mix of  alkaloids such as fuyuziphine and alpha-hydrastine.  Fumaria indica extracts may have anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential.

## Care Guide
Drug Fumitory is an adaptable annual that thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moderately moist, well-draining soil. Reflecting its nature as a common weed in temperate agricultural lands, it is not highly demanding regarding nutrients, flourishing with minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during its growing season, or not at all if the soil is reasonably fertile.
