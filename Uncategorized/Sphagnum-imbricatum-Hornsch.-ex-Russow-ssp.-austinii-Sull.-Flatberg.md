## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (Atlantic coastal plain from Newfoundland south to Florida and west to Texas), and parts of Western Europe (e.g., British Isles) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Bogs / Wetlands (specifically ombrotrophic raised bogs) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun; can tolerate full sun if constantly saturated and humid. |
| **Watering** | Constantly moist to saturated; never allow to dry out. Use distilled or rainwater due to sensitivity to minerals and preference for acidic conditions. |

## Introduction
Sphagnum is a genus of approximately 380 accepted species of mosses, commonly known as sphagnum moss, also bog moss and quacker moss (although that term is also sometimes used for peat). Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16 to 26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions.
As Sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. Thus, Sphagnum can influence the composition of such habitats, with some describing Sphagnum as 'habitat manipulators' or 'autogenic ecosystem engineers'. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants.
Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions.
Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, and any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.

## Care Guide
This bog-dwelling moss needs consistently saturated conditions using distilled or rainwater, along with bright indirect to partial sun. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic environments, making fertilization unnecessary and potentially harmful. High humidity is crucial for its growth.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic environments. High mineral content or fertilizer can be detrimental.
