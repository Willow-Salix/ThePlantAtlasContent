## Introduction
Oxalis ( (British English) or  (American English)) is a large genus of flowering plants in the wood-sorrel family, Oxalidaceae, comprising over 550 species. The genus occurs throughout most of the world, except for the polar areas; species diversity is particularly rich in tropical Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.
Many of the species are known as wood-sorrels (also as wood sorrels or woodsorrels) as they have an acidic taste reminiscent of the sorrel proper (Rumex acetosa), which is not closely related. Some species are called yellow sorrels or pink sorrels after the colour of their flowers instead. Other species are colloquially known as false shamrocks, and some called sourgrasses. For the genus as a whole, the term oxalises is also used.

## Care Guide
This adaptable perennial, native to temperate North America, thrives in a range of light from full sun to partial shade. It prefers consistently moist, but not waterlogged, soil and requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for various garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Low; this plant is not a heavy feeder and can thrive in average to poor soils. Light fertilization once or twice during the active growing season is sufficient, or none if the soil is naturally fertile.
