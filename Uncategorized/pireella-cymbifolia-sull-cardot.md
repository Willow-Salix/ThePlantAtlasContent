# Pireella Moss
### *Pireella cymbifolia (Sull.) Cardot*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida), Caribbean Islands (e.g., Cuba, Jamaica), Mexico, Central America, and South America (e.g., Brazil, Colombia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate, indirect light. This moss thrives under a dense canopy and is highly sensitive to direct sunlight, which can cause scorching. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture and very high humidity are crucial. The substrate should be kept constantly damp but not waterlogged. Frequent misting or placement in a terrarium/humid environment is highly beneficial. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pireella cymbifolia requires conditions mirroring its native humid tropical and subtropical forest environment. Ensure low to moderate indirect light, consistently high humidity, and frequent moisture to keep its substrate damp. Fertilization should be very minimal, as it primarily absorbs nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is required. If desired, a highly diluted (1/8 to 1/4 strength) liquid fertilizer formulated for epiphytes or delicate plants can be applied very sparingly (once or twice a year during active growth).
