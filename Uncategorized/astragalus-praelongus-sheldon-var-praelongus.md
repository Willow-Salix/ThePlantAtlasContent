## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stinking Milkvetch is a resilient plant best suited for arid to semi-arid conditions. It demands full sun exposure and minimal watering, thriving on infrequent waterings and well-drained, lean soils. Avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and can fix its own nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; typically thrives in lean to poor soils. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so supplemental fertilization is rarely needed and can be detrimental.
