## 🌱 Overview
Monardella is a genus of approximately 40 species of annual and perennial plants native to western North America from British Columbia to northwestern Mexico. They are grown for their highly aromatic foliage, which in some species is used for herbal teas. The two-lipped, tubular flowers are formed in terminal clusters and are most usually red, pink, or purple.
Monardella is a Latin diminutive form of Monarda (a taxonomic patronym honoring the Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes), which the form of the flower heads resembles.  Plants in this genus are commonly known as wildmints, coyote mints or monardellas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant California native thrives in full sun to partial shade with very little water once established. It prefers well-drained soil and requires minimal to no fertilization. Mimicking its dry, sunny, and well-drained native habitat is key for successful cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; typically no fertilizer is needed in garden settings, or a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in very poor soils during early spring.
