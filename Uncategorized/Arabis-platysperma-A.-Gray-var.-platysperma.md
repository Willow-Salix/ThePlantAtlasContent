## Care Guide
Pioneer Rockcress requires full sun and exceptionally well-drained soil, mimicking its native rocky, high-altitude habitats. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly as it is adapted to lean conditions. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overwatering to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean, mineral-rich soils; an annual light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost is usually sufficient, or none at all if soil is naturally fertile.
