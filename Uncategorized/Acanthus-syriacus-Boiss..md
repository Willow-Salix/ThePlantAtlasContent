## Care Guide
Syrian Acanthus prefers a Mediterranean-like environment with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. It is highly drought-tolerant once mature, needing infrequent watering during the growing season and very little in winter. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is usually sufficient, as it's adapted to somewhat leaner, rocky soils.
