## 🌱 Overview
Oreomecon nudicaulis, synonym Papaver nudicaule, the Iceland poppy, is a boreal flowering plant. It is native to subpolar regions of Asia and the Yukon in North America (but not Iceland), and has been introduced elsewhere (south Argentina, Colorado, Greenland, and Tibet). Iceland poppies are hardy but short-lived perennials, often grown as biennials. They yield large, papery, bowl-shaped, lightly fragrant flowers supported by hairy, 1 foot (30 cm) curved stems among feathery blue-green foliage 1–6 inches long. They were first described by botanists in 1759. The wild species blooms in white or yellow, and is hardy from USDA Zones 3a-10b.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Iceland Poppies thrive in cool, full sun conditions with well-drained soil, reflecting their native subarctic and alpine environments. Provide consistent moisture without waterlogging to prevent root rot. Minimal fertilization is needed, as too much can reduce bloom production.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; a light application of balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient. Over-fertilization can inhibit flowering.
