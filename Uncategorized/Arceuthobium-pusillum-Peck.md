## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern North America, including eastern Canada (from Newfoundland west to Manitoba) and the northeastern United States (Great Lakes region, New England, and south along the Appalachian Mountains to West Virginia). |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest (Taiga) and Cool Temperate Coniferous Forests, often in boggy or wetland areas. Characterized by cold winters, moderate summers, and consistent precipitation. |
| **Sunlight** | As an obligate parasite growing within the canopy of coniferous trees (such as spruce and tamarack), it is adapted to the light conditions experienced by its host, typically ranging from partial sun to partial shade, consistent with a forest understory or mid-canopy environment. |
| **Watering** | This plant does not absorb water from the soil; it is an obligate parasite that obtains all its water directly from the vascular system of its host tree. Therefore, direct watering for the mistletoe itself is not applicable. Its survival is entirely dependent on the host tree's access to water, which in its native habitat, means consistently moist to wet soil conditions for the host. |

## Introduction
The genus Arceuthobium, commonly called dwarf mistletoes, is a genus of 42 species of parasitic plants that parasitize members of Pinaceae and Cupressaceae in North America, Central America, Asia, Europe, and Africa. Of the 42 species that have been recognized, 39 and 21 of these are endemic to North America and the United States, respectively. They all have very reduced shoots and leaves (mostly reduced to scales) with the bulk of the plant living under the host's bark. Recently the number of species within the genus has been reduced to 26 as a result of more detailed genetic analysis.

## Care Guide
The Eastern Dwarf Mistletoe is an obligate parasite native to the cold, wet coniferous forests of northeastern North America, exclusively growing on specific conifer hosts like black spruce. Its survival entirely depends on its host, from which it draws all water and nutrients. Therefore, 'care' involves maintaining a suitable host tree in its native partial sun to partial shade, consistently moist, boggy environment.

### Fertilizer
As an obligate parasite, Arceuthobium pusillum extracts all necessary nutrients and carbohydrates directly from the phloem and xylem of its host tree. It does not have roots for nutrient absorption from the soil, making direct fertilization irrelevant for the mistletoe itself.
