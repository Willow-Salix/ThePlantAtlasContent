## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Southern United States (e.g., Great Plains, Southwest) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid Grassland and Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure (at least 6-8 hours daily) to thrive and produce abundant blooms, typical of open grassland and scrubland environments. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its native arid conditions. |

## Introduction
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, reflecting its origins in semi-arid grasslands. Provide infrequent, deep watering once established and apply minimal fertilizer to support its growth in lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced granular fertilizer once in spring is sufficient, as it is adapted to lean soils.
