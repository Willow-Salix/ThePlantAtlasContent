## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Arizona, Nevada) and Baja California, Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires high light exposure, typical of its native open, desert habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low to very low. As a desert plant, it is highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, watering infrequently but deeply during active growth, and reducing water significantly during dormancy. |

## Care Guide
Schott's Calico thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrublands and deserts. Provide full sun and very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to completely dry out between sessions. This plant has low fertilizer requirements and prefers well-draining soil.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in nutrient-poor desert soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary, but a light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring can support robust growth if desired.
