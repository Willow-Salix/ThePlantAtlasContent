## 🌱 Overview
Oreocarya (perennial cat's-eye) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. There are about 63 species and its native range extends from western and central Canada, through western United States to north Mexico. It is part of subtribe of Amsinckiinae.
It was once thought to be a either a subgenus or synonym of Cryptantha Lehm. ex G. Don, as they both had plenty of tiny flowers, hairy leaves, and persisting dried flower stems.
Botanist William Alfred Weber later noted that the 2 genera were different in form as Oreocarya was a "biennial or perennial from rosettes of basal leaves; flowers more than 5 mm in diameter, often distinctly long-tubular with prominent yellow eye", while Cryptantha was an "annual without rosettes of basal leaves; flowers minute, less than 5 mm diameter, short-tubed with inconspicuous eye".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Clustered Oreocarya is a resilient plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Western North America, making it ideal for xeriscaping. It requires full sun exposure and is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering. Minimal fertilization is necessary as it naturally thrives in lean, well-draining soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in poor, rocky soils. If desired, a very light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring.
