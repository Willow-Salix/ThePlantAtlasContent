## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado) and northern Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure, ideally 6+ hours of direct sunlight per day, to thrive and produce abundant blooms. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and deep watering. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to root rot in consistently moist conditions. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland. Provide full sun and ensure excellent drainage with infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. Minimal to no fertilization is required for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
