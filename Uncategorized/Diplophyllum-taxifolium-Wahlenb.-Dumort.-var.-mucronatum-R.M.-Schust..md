## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Cold temperate to Arctic-alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including northern North America (e.g., Greenland, Arctic Canada, Alaska), northern Europe, and northern Asia. Also found in high-altitude environments in more southerly regions. |
| **Climate** | Arctic-Alpine Tundra and Boreal/Subarctic zones, often in damp, exposed, or partially shaded microclimates. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade, protected from intense, drying direct sun. It prefers cooler temperatures. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, high humidity; the substrate should never be allowed to dry out completely but also must not be waterlogged. Good drainage is essential, alongside constant moisture. |

## Introduction
Scapaniaceae is a family of liverworts in order Jungermanniales. The family has been extended to include the former family Lophoziaceae.

## Care Guide
This Arctic-alpine liverwort thrives in consistently cool, moist, and highly humid conditions. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade, ensuring its substrate remains constantly damp, but never waterlogged. It requires minimal to no fertilization, preferring the nutrient-poor environments typical of its native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low, if any. These non-vascular plants thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. If fertilizing, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly and infrequently.
