## Care Guide
Bowlesia thrives in high sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its origins in arid scrublands and grasslands. It is drought tolerant and requires infrequent, deep watering, with minimal need for fertilizer, preferring lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; light, infrequent fertilization (e.g., once or twice during the growing season) is sufficient, or none in reasonably fertile soil.
