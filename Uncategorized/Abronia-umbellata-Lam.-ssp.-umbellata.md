## Care Guide
Pink Sand Verbena thrives in full sun and extremely well-drained, sandy soils, mirroring its native coastal dune habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. The key to its care is providing ample sunlight and excellent drainage.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements, as its native sandy soils are typically poor in nutrients. Over-fertilization can harm the plant.
