| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in open, well-lit wet areas but tolerating some filtered light. |
| **💧 Water** | Needs consistently wet to moist soil, often found in shallow standing water or saturated ground. Do not allow soil to dry out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dotted Smartweed thrives in conditions mimicking its native wetlands, requiring consistently wet to moist soil and preferring full sun to partial shade. Moderate fertilization during the growing season will support its vigorous growth. Ensure it never dries out to mimic its natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growing season, as wetland soils can vary in nutrient richness.
