## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native flourishes in conditions that replicate its tropical moist forest habitat, requiring bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide moderate fertilization during the growing season and ensure protection from intense, direct sunlight to prevent leaf burn.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding during the active growing season (spring and summer). Use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks.
