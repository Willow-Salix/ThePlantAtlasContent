## Care Guide
This wetland grass thrives in full sun and demands consistently moist to wet soil conditions, ideally mimicking its native marsh and bog habitats. Ensure it receives ample water and consider moderate fertilization to support its robust growth throughout the season.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer application once in early spring, or occasional liquid feeding during the growing season, especially in nutrient-poor soils.
