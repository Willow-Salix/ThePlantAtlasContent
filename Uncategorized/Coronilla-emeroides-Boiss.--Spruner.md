## Care Guide
Thriving in sunny, open locations, Shrubby Coronilla requires minimal watering once established due to its adaptation to hot, dry summers. Ensure excellent drainage and provide moderate sun exposure to replicate its native Mediterranean conditions. Fertilization is generally light, supporting its robust growth in less fertile soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in early spring, or annually if soil is poor.
