## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of Europe and North America, particularly in mountainous or upland areas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Rocky Outcrop |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect to partial sun, tolerating periods of full sun exposure typical for exposed rock faces. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires cycles of thorough wetting (e.g., misting, brief soaking) followed by complete drying out. Mimic natural rainfall patterns, allowing several dry days between rehydration. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dermatocarpon is a genus of lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. Members of the genus are commonly called stippleback lichens because they have fruiting structures called perithecia that are flask-shaped structures embedded in the nonfruiting body (thallus), with a hole in the top to release spores, causing an appearance of being covered with small black dots. Its species are told apart chiefly by spore size, the colour and texture of the lower surface, and whether the epinecral layer gives a pruinose bloom.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Silverskin Lichen thrives in bright, indirect to partial sun, commonly found on exposed rocks. It requires cycles of thorough rehydration followed by complete drying. Avoid any form of fertilization, as lichens are sensitive to excess nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilization is required. Lichens are sensitive to high nutrient levels; atmospheric deposition and runoff provide sufficient nutrients.
