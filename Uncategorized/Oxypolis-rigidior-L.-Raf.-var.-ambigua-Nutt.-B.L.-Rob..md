## Care Guide
Stiff Cowbane thrives in conditions mirroring its native humid subtropical wetlands, requiring full to partial sun and consistently wet soil. It tolerates moderate fertilization, benefiting from an environment with high humidity and abundant water.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. While wetland soils can be rich in organic matter, a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season if soil nutrients are suspected to be low.
