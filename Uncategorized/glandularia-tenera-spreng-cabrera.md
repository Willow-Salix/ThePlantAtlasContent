## 🌱 Overview
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Latin American Mock Vervain thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native open grassland habitat. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and benefits from light fertilization during its active growth period to promote continuous blooming.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer applied monthly during the growing season is sufficient, or a slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring, as it's not native to highly nutrient-rich environments.
