## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona) and Northwestern Mexico (Sonora) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Desert / Sonoran Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive and flower. |
| **💧 Water** | Very infrequent watering, only when the soil is completely dry. Mimic sporadic desert rainfall by drenching thoroughly then allowing for extended dry periods, especially during cooler dormant months. |

## 🌱 Overview
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Nichol's Hedgehog Cactus thrives in conditions mirroring its desert home: intense direct sunlight and very little water. Ensure excellent drainage and allow the soil to fully dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. Provide minimal nutrients, as it is adapted to lean desert soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer needed. A diluted, balanced or low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring to early summer), but it is not essential if repotted regularly.
