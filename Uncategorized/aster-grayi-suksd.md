## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gray's Aster is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering, and has minimal fertilizer needs. Mimic its native temperate woodland and grassland conditions for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to average to poor soils typical of its native habitat. Minimal or no fertilization is usually needed; an annual top-dressing with compost or a very light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth is poor.
