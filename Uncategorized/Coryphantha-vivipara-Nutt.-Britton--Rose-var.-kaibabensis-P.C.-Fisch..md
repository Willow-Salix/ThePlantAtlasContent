## Introduction
Coryphantha (from Greek, "flowering on the top"), or beehive cactus, is a genus of small to middle-sized, globose or columnar cacti. The genus is native to arid parts of Central America, Mexico, through Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas and north into southwestern, central, and southeastern Montana. With its two subgenera, 57 species and 20 subspecies, it is one of the largest genera of cactus.

## Care Guide
This arid montane cactus thrives in bright, sunny conditions, mimicking its native Kaibab Plateau habitat. Provide full sun and practice infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to fully dry out between sessions. Fertilize very sparingly with a specialized cactus formula during its growing period.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. A diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
