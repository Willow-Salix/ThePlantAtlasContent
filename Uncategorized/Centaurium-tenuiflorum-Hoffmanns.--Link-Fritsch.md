## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, including Southern Europe (e.g., Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece) and North Africa (e.g., Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia). |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure is essential, mimicking its native open, sunny habitats in grasslands, scrublands, and coastal areas. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering. This plant is adapted to the dry summers of the Mediterranean, tolerating drought conditions once established. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Centaurium (centaury) is a genus of 20 species in the gentian family (Gentianaceae), tribe Chironieae, subtribe Chironiinae. The genus was named after the centaur Chiron, famed in Greek mythology for his skill in medicinal herbs. It is distributed across Europe and Asia.
Until 2004, Centaurium was given a much wider circumscription, comprising about 50 species ranging across Europe, Asia, the Americas, Australasia, and the Pacific. However this circumscription was polyphyletic, so in 2004 the genus was split into four, being Centaurium sensu stricto, Zeltnera, Gyrandra, and Schenkia.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Slender Centaury requires full sun exposure and well-draining soil, reflecting its Mediterranean origins. Watering should be infrequent and deep, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, as it is drought-tolerant. Minimal fertilization is needed, generally a light feed in spring or none at all.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Its native soils are often not exceptionally rich. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, or no fertilizer if planted in reasonably fertile soil.
