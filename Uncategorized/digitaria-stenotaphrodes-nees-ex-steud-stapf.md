## 🌱 Overview
Digitaria is a genus of plants in the grass family native to tropical and warm temperate regions but can occur in tropical, subtropical, and cooler temperate regions as well. Common names include crabgrass, finger-grass, and fonio. They are slender monocotyledonous annual and perennial lawn, pasture, and forage plants; some are often considered lawn pests. Digitus is the Latin word for "finger", and they are distinguished by the long, finger-like inflorescences they produce.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient grass thrives in full sun conditions, replicating its native grassland environment. It requires moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and benefits from occasional, light fertilization during its active growth period. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, a general-purpose fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
