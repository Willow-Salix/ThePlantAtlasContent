## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal and Temperate regions, including Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, UK) and North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Pacific Northwest), often in montane and subalpine zones. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane to Boreal Forest/Alpine transition |
| **Sunlight** | High direct sunlight; typically found on exposed rock surfaces with minimal shading. |
| **Watering** | Periodic rehydration from rainfall, dew, or mist, followed by complete drying. Tolerates extended dry periods; avoid constant moisture. |

## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
This rock-dwelling lichen thrives in high direct sunlight and needs periodic rehydration from natural rainfall or mist, allowing for complete drying in between. It requires no fertilization, as it absorbs nutrients directly from its environment and is sensitive to added nutrients.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens absorb all necessary nutrients directly from the air, rain, and substrate, and are sensitive to external fertilizers.
