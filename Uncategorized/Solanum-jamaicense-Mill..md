## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caribbean islands (e.g., Jamaica, Cuba, Puerto Rico), Florida, Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests (often found in disturbed areas, forest edges, or secondary growth) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate full sun in tropical climates if kept well-watered. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Solanum is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants, which include three food crops of high economic importance: the potato, the tomato and the eggplant (aubergine, brinjal). It is the largest genus in the nightshade family Solanaceae, comprising around 1,500 species. It also contains the so-called horse nettles (unrelated to the genus of true nettles, Urtica), as well as numerous plants cultivated for their ornamental flowers and fruit.
Solanum species show a wide range of growth habits, such as annuals and perennials, vines, subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees. Many formerly independent genera like Lycopersicon (the tomatoes) and Cyphomandra are now included in Solanum as subgenera or sections. Thus, the genus today contains roughly 1,500–2,000 species.
