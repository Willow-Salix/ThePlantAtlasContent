## Care Guide
Shortleaf Amsonia thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly adaptable to dry, arid conditions. It requires minimal watering once established and generally needs little to no fertilization. This resilient plant is ideal for xeriscaping or low-maintenance gardens in hot, dry climates.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light, balanced fertilizer annually if growth is poor, as it is adapted to less fertile soils.
