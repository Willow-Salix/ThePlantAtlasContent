## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe and Eastern/Central North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Bog/Wetland and Moist Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade; avoids direct harsh sunlight to prevent leaf scorch. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged, mimicking its native wet habitats. Requires high ambient humidity. |

## Introduction
The moth genus Dryopteris is now considered a junior synonym of Oreta.

Dryopteris , commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to Dryopteris filix-mas), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales.
Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American Dryopteris hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization.
The fossil record of this genus shows that it was widespread even as far back as the Cretaceous with fossils being found in Late Cretaceous rock layers from North America down to Antarctica.

## Care Guide
This hybrid woodfern thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate bog and moist woodland habitats. Provide consistent moisture, high humidity, and partial to full shade to ensure optimal growth. Fertilize lightly during the active growing season to support its moderate nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer during the active growing season; prefers organic-rich soil but is not a heavy feeder.
