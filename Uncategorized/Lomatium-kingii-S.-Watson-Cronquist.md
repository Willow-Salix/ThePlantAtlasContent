## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (e.g., California, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho) |
| **Climate** | Arid Montane Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight) due to its native open, high-altitude, and often treeless habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low; water infrequently, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, mimicking its native habitat's spring moisture followed by dry summers. |

## Introduction
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires very well-drained, lean soil, mimicking its arid montane origins. Water sparingly once established, ensuring the soil dries out completely between applications, and avoid excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean, very well-drained, and nutrient-poor soils. Over-fertilization should be avoided as it can be detrimental.
