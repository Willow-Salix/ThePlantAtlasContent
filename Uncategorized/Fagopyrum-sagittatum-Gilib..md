## Care Guide
Common Buckwheat is a hardy, fast-growing annual originating from temperate mountainous areas. It thrives in full to partial sun with consistent moisture in well-draining soil. It has low fertilizer requirements and is often grown as a cover crop or for its seeds.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. It thrives in less fertile soils and can even improve soil quality; avoid high nitrogen fertilizers which promote leaf growth over grain.
