## Care Guide
This California native thrives in a Mediterranean climate, preferring full sun to partial shade. It needs consistent moisture during its active growth in the cooler, wet seasons and can tolerate dry summers. A light spring fertilization will support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in early spring is usually sufficient, as it's adapted to native soils.
