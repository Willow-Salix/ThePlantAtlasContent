## Care Guide
The Sonoran Indigo thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its arid desert origins. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. Fertilization is generally not needed due to its adaptation to lean soils and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils and as a legume, it likely fixes its own nitrogen. Minimal or no fertilization is typically required.
