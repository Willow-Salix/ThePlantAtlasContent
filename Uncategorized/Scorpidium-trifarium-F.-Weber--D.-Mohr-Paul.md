## Care Guide
This aquatic moss thrives in consistently cool, wet conditions, mirroring its native bog and fen habitats. Provide partial shade or indirect light and maintain very high humidity, ensuring the substrate is always moist or submerged to prevent drying out. Fertilizer is generally not required.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; mosses are adapted to nutrient-poor environments and excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
