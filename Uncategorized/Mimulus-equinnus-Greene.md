## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
Specific information for 'Mimulus equinnus Greene' is not readily available in current botanical databases. However, general Mimulus care involves maintaining consistently moist, well-draining soil and providing partial to full sun exposure. Light fertilization can support growth, but the primary focus should be on consistent moisture to mimic their typically wet native habitats.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization during growing season, or incorporate organic matter; avoid over-fertilization (assuming typical Mimulus characteristics).
