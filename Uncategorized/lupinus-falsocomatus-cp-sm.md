## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thrive by providing full sun exposure, mimicking its native high-altitude environment. Water moderately, ensuring well-draining soil and allowing it to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize sparingly with a low-nitrogen formula to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced or low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus/potassium fertilizer can be applied sparingly if soil is poor.
