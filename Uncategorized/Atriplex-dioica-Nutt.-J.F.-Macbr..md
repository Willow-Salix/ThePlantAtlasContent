## Introduction
Atriplex () is a plant genus of about 250 species, known by the common names of saltbush and orache (; also spelled orach). It belongs to the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae s.l.. 
The genus is quite variable and widely distributed. It includes many desert and seashore plants and halophytes, as well as plants of moist environments. 
The generic name originated in Latin and was applied by Pliny the Elder to the edible oraches. The name saltbush derives from the fact that the plants retain salt in their leaves; they are able to grow in areas affected by soil salination.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in harsh, arid conditions, requiring full sun and very little water once established. Its native habitat of poor, often saline soils means it needs minimal to no fertilization. Emulate these conditions for successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile, often alkaline or saline soils. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all.
