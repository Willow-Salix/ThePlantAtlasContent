## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (ranging from Texas east to Florida, and north to parts of New England) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Wetland and Bog (aquatic environments) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in bright, direct light for several hours daily. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant submersion in pure, low-mineral water (distilled, reverse osmosis, or rainwater). Water levels must be consistently maintained. |

## Introduction
Utricularia, commonly and collectively called the bladderworts, is a genus of carnivorous plants consisting of approximately 233 species (precise counts differ based on classification opinions; a 2001 publication lists 215 species). They occur in freshwater and wet soil as terrestrial or aquatic species across every continent except Antarctica. Utricularia are cultivated for their flowers, which are often compared with those of snapdragons and orchids, especially amongst carnivorous plant enthusiasts.
All Utricularia are carnivorous and capture small organisms by means of bladder-like traps. Terrestrial species tend to have tiny traps that feed on minute prey such as protozoa and rotifers swimming in water-saturated soil. The traps can range in size from 0.02 to 1.2 cm (0.008 to 0.5 in). Aquatic species, such as U. vulgaris (common bladderwort), possess bladders that are usually larger and can feed on more substantial prey such as water fleas (Daphnia), nematodes and even fish fry, mosquito larvae and young tadpoles. Despite their small size, the traps are extremely sophisticated. In the active traps of the aquatic species, prey brush against trigger hairs connected to the trapdoor. The bladder, when "set", is under negative pressure in relation to its environment so that when the trapdoor is mechanically triggered, the prey, along with the water surrounding it, is sucked into the bladder. Once the bladder is full of water, the door closes again, the whole process taking only ten to fifteen milliseconds.
Bladderworts are unusual and highly specialized plants, and the vegetative organs are not clearly separated into roots, leaves, and stems as in most other angiosperms.  Utricularia lack a root system.
Bladder traps  are recognized as one of the most sophisticated structures in the plant kingdom.

## Care Guide
The Swollen Bladderwort is an aquatic carnivorous plant that needs full to partial sun exposure and continuous submersion in pure, nutrient-free water. Traditional fertilizers should be avoided, as it relies on catching small aquatic organisms for its nutritional needs.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization is needed. As a carnivorous plant, it captures its own prey; adding nutrients to the water can be detrimental.
