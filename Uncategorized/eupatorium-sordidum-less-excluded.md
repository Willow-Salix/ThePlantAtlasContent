## 🌱 Overview
Eupatorium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, containing from 36 to 60 species depending on the classification system. Most are herbaceous perennials growing to 0.5–3 m (1.6–9.8 ft) tall. A few are shrubs. The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The type species of the genus Eupatorium cannabinum, which is also the sole European species, is known as hemp-agrimony. Most in North America are commonly called boneset, thoroughwort or snakeroot. The genus is named after Mithridates VI Eupator, king of Pontus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mexican cloud forest environment. Provide bright, indirect light or partial shade, and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil. Fertilize moderately during its active growth period to support lush growth and flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding during the growing season (spring to late summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, as native soils are often rich in organic matter from leaf litter.
