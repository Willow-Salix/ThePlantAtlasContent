## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spiny Goldenweed is a resilient, drought-tolerant plant best suited for full sun and well-draining, lean soils, mimicking its native arid grassland habitat. Provide infrequent watering, allowing soil to dry completely, and avoid excessive fertilization for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to average, lean soils. Fertilizer is generally not required; excessive fertilization can be detrimental. If growth appears very weak, a single light application of a balanced fertilizer in early spring may be considered.
