## Introduction
Xanthisma, common name sleepy-daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.
The generic name comes from the Greek "xanthos," "yellow", and "-ismos," "condition." It was first described in 1836 from material collected in "The Mexican Province of Texas."

## Care Guide
Spiny Goldenweed is a resilient, drought-tolerant plant best suited for full sun and well-draining, lean soils, mimicking its native arid grassland habitat. Provide infrequent watering, allowing soil to dry completely, and avoid excessive fertilization for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to average, lean soils. Fertilizer is generally not required; excessive fertilization can be detrimental. If growth appears very weak, a single light application of a balanced fertilizer in early spring may be considered.
