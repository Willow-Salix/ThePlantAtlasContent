| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, bright conditions typical of its native wetland habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Constantly wet to moist soil. Requires high humidity and can tolerate standing water; mimicking bog or marsh conditions is ideal. |

## 🌱 Overview
Fuirena, called umbrella sedges or umbrella grasses, are a genus of flowering plants in the sedge family (Cyperaceae), with a worldwide distribution, chiefly in the tropics and temperate zones. They are named for Danish physician and early botanist Georg Fuiren (Jorgen Furenius), 1581–1628.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wetland sedge thrives in consistently wet to moist soil, ideally with high humidity and the ability to tolerate standing water, much like its native bog and marsh habitats. It prefers full to partial sun exposure and has low to moderate fertilizer needs, adapting well to nutrient conditions typical of its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a wetland plant, it is adapted to often nutrient-poor or moderately rich boggy soils. A light, balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season might be beneficial, but over-fertilization should be avoided.
