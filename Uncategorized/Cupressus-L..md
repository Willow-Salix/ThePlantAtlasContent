*Cupressus L.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, parts of Western North America (e.g., California, Arizona), and parts of Asia (e.g., Himalayas, China) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean, temperate semi-arid, and mountainous regions |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, ideally receiving at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflecting their open native environments. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, typical of their native drier summers. |

## Introduction
Cypress is a common name for species in several genera in the family Cupressaceae. They grow in temperate climates and subtropical regions of Asia, Europe, and North America.
The word cypress is derived from Old French cipres, which was imported from Latin cypressus, the latinisation of the Greek κυπάρισσος (kyparissos). The name derives from Cyparissus, a mythological figure who was turned into a cypress tree after killing a stag.

## Care Guide
Cypress trees thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring their native Mediterranean and semi-arid habitats. Once established, they are drought-tolerant and require deep, infrequent watering. Fertilize sparingly to maintain health without over-enrichment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once a year in spring, or only when growth appears stunted, as native soils are not overly rich.
