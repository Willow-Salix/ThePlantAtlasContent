## Introduction
Spiranthes is a genus of orchids in the subfamily Orchidoideae. They are known commonly as ladies tresses, ladies'-tresses, or lady's tresses. The genus is distributed in the Americas, Eurasia, and Australia. The genus name Spiranthes is derived from the Greek speira ("coil") and anthos ("flower"), and was inspired by the spirally arranged inflorescence.

## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical forest floor origins: consistent moisture, high humidity, and dappled sunlight. Provide bright, indirect light and keep the soil evenly moist but well-drained, fertilizing lightly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Apply a diluted balanced orchid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/2 strength) every 2-4 weeks during the growing season.
