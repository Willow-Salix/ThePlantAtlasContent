## Introduction
Acacia lineata A.Cunn. ex G.Don, commonly known as streaked wattle or narrow lined-leaved wattle, occurs naturally inland eastern Australia. The genus Acacia is the largest genus of flowering plants in Australia, containing around 1000 species throughout a diverse range of environments from coast to desert.
The word Acacia is thought to have been derived from a Greek word for sharpen, and lineata from a Latin word meaning marked by fine parallel lines.
Currently A. lineata is not considered rare or endangered. It occurs in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria where it is considered as uncommon.

## Care Guide
This Australian native wattle thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, adapted to temperate to semi-arid conditions. It requires infrequent watering once established and generally needs minimal or no fertilizer, especially avoiding high phosphorus types. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Avoid high phosphorus fertilizers.
