## Care Guide
This tropical plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect to partial sun exposure. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from regular fertilization during its active growth period to support its vigorous nature.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength, due to its growth in naturally rich forest soils.
