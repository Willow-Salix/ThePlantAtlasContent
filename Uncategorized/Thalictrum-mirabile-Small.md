## Introduction
Thalictrum ( ) is a genus of 120-200 species of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae, native mostly to temperate regions. Meadow-rue is a common name for plants in this genus.
Thalictrum is a taxonomically difficult genus with poorly understood species boundaries; it is in need of further taxonomic and field research for clarification.
Despite their common name of "meadow-rue", Thalictrum species are not closely related to the true rue (family Rutaceae), but resemble its members in having compound leaves twice or thrice divided.

## Care Guide
This plant flourishes in conditions similar to its native Appalachian habitat, preferring cool, consistently moist, well-drained soil in partial to dappled shade. Protect it from harsh afternoon sun and maintain adequate soil moisture to ensure optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from soil enriched with organic matter and a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring.
