## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western Europe (including the Iberian Peninsula, France, Italy, and parts of the UK) and North Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean and Temperate Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native open scrubland and hedgerow habitats, it is exposed to significant sunlight, indicating a preference for full sun for best growth and fruit production, though it can tolerate some afternoon shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Native to regions with dry summers, it can tolerate some drought once established. However, consistent moisture, especially during dry periods and fruit development, will promote healthier growth and better yields. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rubus is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, subfamily Rosoideae, most commonly known as brambles. Fruits of various species are known as raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, and bristleberries. It is a diverse genus, with the estimated number of Rubus species varying from 250 to over 1000, found across all continents except Antarctica.
Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles like roses; spines, bristles, and gland-tipped hairs are also common in the genus. The Rubus fruit, sometimes called a bramble fruit, is an aggregate of drupelets. The term cane fruit or cane berry applies to any Rubus species or hybrid which is commonly grown with supports such as wires or canes, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry. The stems of such plants are also referred to as canes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Elmleaf Blackberry is a resilient plant, thriving in full sun to partial shade, reflecting its origins in open Mediterranean and temperate scrublands. It requires moderate watering, particularly during extended dry spells and fruit production, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization, ideally through organic matter, to support its vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a vigorous shrub found in diverse soils in its native range, it isn't exceptionally demanding. It benefits from organic matter enrichment (compost) in spring or a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer if soil nutrients are poor.
