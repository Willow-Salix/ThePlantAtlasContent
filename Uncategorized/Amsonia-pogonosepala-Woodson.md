## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient perennial thrives in humid subtropical climates, preferring locations with full sun to partial shade. It requires regular watering for optimal growth, particularly in dry conditions, but is quite self-sufficient once established, needing minimal fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient if soil is poor, otherwise generally not needed.
