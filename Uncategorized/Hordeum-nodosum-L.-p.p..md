## Care Guide
Meadow Barley thrives in full sun with moderate, consistent watering, and tolerates some drought once established. It requires low to moderate fertilization, mimicking its natural temperate grassland environment for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A general-purpose balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly, as native meadow soils provide adequate but not excessively rich nutrients.
