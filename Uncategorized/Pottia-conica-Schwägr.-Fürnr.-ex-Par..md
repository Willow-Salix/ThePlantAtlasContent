## Care Guide
Conical Pottia is a temperate moss that prefers bright indirect light to partial sun on consistently moist, well-draining, and often calcareous substrates. It requires minimal fertilization and can tolerate short periods of dryness, making it relatively hardy for a moss.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. If desired, a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied infrequently during active growth.
