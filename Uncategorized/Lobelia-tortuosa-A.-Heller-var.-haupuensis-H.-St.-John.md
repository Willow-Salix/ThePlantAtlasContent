## Care Guide
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in conditions replicating its native tropical wet forest habitat: consistent moisture, high humidity, and bright indirect light. Ensure well-draining soil and provide light, balanced fertilization during active growth to support its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Light, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season, mimicking nutrient-rich forest floor decomposition.
