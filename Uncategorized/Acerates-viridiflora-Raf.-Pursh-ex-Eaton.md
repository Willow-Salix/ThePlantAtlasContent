## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern North America (United States and Canada), ranging from Ontario south to Florida and west to Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie and Temperate Forest Edge, specifically dry-mesic prairies, open woodlands, glades, and savannas. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its natural habitat in open fields and woodland edges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, mimicking its native dry-mesic conditions. |

## Introduction
Asclepias is a genus of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants known as milkweeds, named for their latex, a milky substance containing cardiac glycosides termed cardenolides, exuded where cells are damaged. Most species are toxic to humans and many other species, primarily due to the presence of cardenolides. However, as with many such plants, some species feed upon milkweed leaves or the nectar from their flowers. A noteworthy feeder on milkweeds is the monarch butterfly, which uses and requires certain milkweeds as host plants for its larvae.
The Asclepias genus contains over 200 species distributed broadly across Africa, North America, and South America. It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.

## Care Guide
Green Milkweed thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil, characteristic of its native prairie habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overly rich or consistently wet soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
