## Introduction
Platanthera stricta is a species of orchid known by the common name slender bog orchid. It is native to western North America from Alaska and Yukon south to Utah and northern California.
Platanthera stricta grows in wet areas, such as shady forest meadows. It produces a slender, erect flowering stem up to about 80 centimetres (31 in) tall. The longest leaves near the base of the stem are up to 11 centimetres (4+1⁄3 in) long by 2.5 centimetres (1 in) wide. The inflorescence has widely spaced green flowers, sometimes tinged red or purple. The sepals and petals are around one-half centimetre (1⁄4 in) long and each flower has a club-shaped spur.

## Care Guide
The Slender Bog Orchid thrives in consistently wet, acidic conditions, typical of its native bog and wetland environments. It requires bright indirect light to partial sun and benefits from high humidity. Fertilize sparingly with a highly diluted solution to avoid nutrient burn.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization. Use a very dilute orchid-specific fertilizer (1/4 to 1/8 strength) once a month during active growth.
