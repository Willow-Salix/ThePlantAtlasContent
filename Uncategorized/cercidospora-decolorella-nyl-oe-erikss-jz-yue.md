# Cercidospora decolorella (Nyl.) O.E. Erikss. & J.Z. Yue
### *Cercidospora decolorella (Nyl.) O.E. Erikss. & J.Z. Yue*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate, typically found in moist and somewhat shaded microclimates within broader biomes like forests or rocky outcrops, where its host lichens thrive. |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect; as a lichenicolous fungus, its 'light needs' are those of its host lichens, which generally prefer partial shade to moderate, indirect light to maintain moisture and prevent desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Indirect; relies on consistently moist conditions in its microhabitat, sustained by high ambient humidity, regular rainfall, or dew, essential for the health and growth of its host lichens. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cercidospora is a genus of fungi in the class Dothideomycetes. The relationship of this taxon to other taxa within the class is unknown (incertae sedis). The genus was first described by Gustav Wilhelm Körber in 1865; it is synonymous with the name Prolisea described by Frederick Edward Clements in 1931.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cercidospora decolorella is a parasitic fungus that grows on specific lichens in temperate zones. Its 'care' hinges entirely on providing optimal conditions for its host, requiring consistently high humidity, moist surfaces, and protection from intense direct sunlight. Traditional plant care strategies, such as soil watering or fertilization, do not apply and could be detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; as a parasitic lichenicolous fungus, it obtains all necessary nutrients directly from its host lichen. External fertilization or soil nutrient richness is irrelevant.
