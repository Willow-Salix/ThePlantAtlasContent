## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Montane Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is preferred, tolerating light afternoon shade in the hottest climates. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant perennial thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its arid montane origins. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization to ensure robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required. Thrives in lean to poor soils; excessive fertilization can harm the plant.
