## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western and Central North America, from Alaska and Yukon south through western Canada and the western and central United States. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Wetland |
| **☀️ Light** | Thrives in full sun, tolerating partial shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil and does not tolerate drought. Water frequently to keep the soil saturated, mimicking its native streambank and wetland habitats. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Yellow Willow, ensure it receives full sun exposure and consistently moist to wet soil conditions, as it is accustomed to riparian environments. Regular, ample watering is crucial, as it will not tolerate dry soil. Fertilization is generally moderate, with supplemental feeding only necessary in nutrient-deficient soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilizer needs. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil is poor, but it often thrives without heavy feeding in naturally rich, moist soils.
