## Care Guide
To care for Meyen's Flatsedge, emulate its tropical wetland origin by providing consistently moist to wet soil and plenty of bright light to partial shade. Occasional light fertilization during its active growth period will support healthy development. Ensure it never dries out completely, as it is adapted to waterlogged conditions.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season; wetland soils can be rich in organic matter but benefit from occasional nutrient boosts.
