## Care Guide
This montane variety thrives in full sun and well-drained, rocky soil, mimicking its native dry slopes. It requires moderate to infrequent watering, tolerating drought once established, and benefits from minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal; native to lean, rocky soils, it does not require heavy fertilization.
