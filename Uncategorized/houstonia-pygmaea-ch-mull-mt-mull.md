## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pygmy Bluet flourishes in the bright, open conditions of its native southern Texas. It demands well-draining soil and is exceptionally drought-tolerant, meaning it prefers infrequent watering once established. Fertilization needs are very low, reflecting its adaptation to less nutrient-rich environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically needs minimal fertilization. A light application of a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally fertile soil.
