## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of South America (e.g., Brazil, Colombia), Central America, and the Caribbean. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Humid Forest / Subtropical Humid Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to partial shade. As an epiphytic lichen, it thrives under a canopy with dappled light, protected from intense direct sun. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is essential. Requires frequent exposure to moisture, either through regular misting, high ambient humidity, or natural rainfall; does not tolerate prolonged dry periods. |

## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen needs a consistently humid environment and indirect light, mirroring its native tropical forest habitat. Ensure frequent moisture exposure through misting and protect it from any direct, harsh sunlight. Avoid traditional fertilizers, as they can be harmful to lichens.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients directly from the air, rainwater, and their substrate; chemical fertilizers can be detrimental.
