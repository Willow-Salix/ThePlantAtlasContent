## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (primarily Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada regions, including states like California, Oregon, Wyoming, Idaho, Arizona, and New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, as it naturally occurs in open meadows and along streambanks at high elevations. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist to wet, never allowing it to dry out. It thrives in boggy or marshy conditions, mimicking its native wetland habitat sustained by snowmelt and rainfall. |

## Introduction
Swertia is a genus in the gentian family containing plants sometimes referred to as the felworts. Some species bear very showy purple and blue flowers. Many members of this genus have medicinal and cultural purposes.
Plants of genus Frasera are sometimes considered part of this genus, sometimes as a separate genus, and sometimes as synonymous.

## Care Guide
Alpine Swertia requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, replicating its natural subalpine wetland habitat. It thrives in full to partial sun and benefits from a light, balanced fertilizer application in spring to support its growth cycle.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, but over-fertilization should be avoided as native wetland soils can vary in nutrient richness.
