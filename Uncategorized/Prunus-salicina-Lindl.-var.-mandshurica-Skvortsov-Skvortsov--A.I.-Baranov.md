## Introduction
Prunus is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs from the family Rosaceae. The genus includes plums, cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots and almonds (collectively stonefruit). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, being native to the temperate regions of North America, the neotropics of South America, and temperate and tropical regions of Eurasia and Africa, There are about 340 accepted species as of March 2024.
Many members of the genus are widely cultivated for their sweet, fleshy fruit and for decorative purposes of their flowers. Prunus fruit are drupes, or stone fruits. The fleshy mesocarp surrounding the endocarp is edible while the endocarp itself forms a hard, inedible shell called the pyrena ("stone" or "pit"). This shell encloses the seed (or "kernel"), which is edible in some species (such as sweet almonds), but poisonous in many others (such as apricot kernels). Besides being eaten off the hand, most Prunus fruit  are also commonly used in processing, such as jam production, canning, drying, and the seeds for roasting.

## Care Guide
The Manchurian Plum thrives in full sun with fertile, well-draining soil, reflecting its native temperate humid continental climate. Ensure consistent moisture, especially during the growing and fruiting seasons, and provide regular fertilization to support vigorous growth and a bountiful harvest.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Fertilize annually in early spring with a balanced fruit tree fertilizer, supplementing with additional nutrients during fruit set if needed.
