## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Florida native thrives in full sun and well-drained sandy soils, adapting to the humid subtropical climate with its wet summers and drier winters. It requires moderate to high watering during dry periods and establishment, but due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it has low fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. As a native plant and a legume, it's adapted to relatively lean, sandy soils and can fix its own nitrogen. Over-fertilization is typically not necessary and can be detrimental.
