## Care Guide
This hardy plant thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, adapting well to arid and semi-arid conditions. It requires minimal watering once established and generally does not need frequent fertilization, preferring well-drained, average to poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization. Excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
