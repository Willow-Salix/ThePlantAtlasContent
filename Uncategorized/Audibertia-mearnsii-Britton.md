## Introduction
Mentha, also known as mint (from Greek μίνθα míntha, Linear B mi-ta), is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is estimated that 13 to 24 species exist, but the exact distinction between species is unclear. Hybridization occurs naturally where some species' ranges overlap. Many hybrids and cultivars are known.
The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution, growing best in wet environments and moist soils.

## Care Guide
Mearns' Sage thrives in sunny, arid conditions with excellent drainage, mimicking its native montane scrubland habitat. Provide full sun and water infrequently once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and minimize fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; thrives in lean soils. An optional light feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring if growth is poor.
