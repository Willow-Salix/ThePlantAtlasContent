## Introduction
Trifolium occidentale, the western clover, is a clover plant belonging to the genus Trifolium in the legume family, Fabaceae. Its flowers are white, similar to white clover (Trifolium repens), with which it has long been confused. This species lives almost exclusively in sand dunes and sea cliffs on the Atlantic coast of Europe, especially Cornwall and the Channel Islands. The species was first described in 1961 by Dr David E Coombe of Cambridge University.

## Care Guide
Western Clover thrives in full sun within a temperate oceanic climate, preferring consistently moist, well-drained soil. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires minimal fertilization. Mimic its native coastal grassland habitat for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
