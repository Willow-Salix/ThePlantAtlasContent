## Introduction
Caltha palustris, known as marsh-marigold and kingcup, is a small to medium sized perennial herbaceous plant of the buttercup family, native to marshes, fens, ditches and wet woodland in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It flowers between April and August, dependent on altitude and latitude, but occasional flowers may occur at other times.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in perpetually wet conditions, ideally in standing water or boggy areas, mimicking its native temperate wetland habitat. Provide partial to full sun for best flowering and ensure the soil never dries out. Fertilize lightly in spring if not in rich organic soil.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced slow-release fertilizer or organic matter can be incorporated in spring, especially if not in naturally rich wetland soil.
