## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions of North America (Alaska, Canada, Greenland) and Eurasia (Siberia) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. It is accustomed to long daylight hours but cool temperatures during the growing season. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is preferred, but excellent drainage is critical to prevent root rot, especially in cold conditions. Water regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Polemonium, commonly called Jacob's ladders or Jacob's-ladders (the name derived from the Biblical story), is a genus of between 25 and 40 species of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae, native to cool temperate to arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. One species, Polemonium micranthum, also occurs in the southern Andes in South America. Many of the species grow at high altitudes, in mountainous areas. Most of the uncertainty in the number of species relates to those in Eurasia, many of which have been synonymized with Polemonium caeruleum.
Polemonium are perennial plants (rarely annual plants) growing 10–120 cm tall with bright green leaves divided into lance-shaped leaflets. They produce blue (rarely white or pink) flowers in the spring and summer.
Some species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora polemoniella.

## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine plant requires cool temperatures and well-drained, gritty soil. Provide full to partial sun and consistent moisture, ensuring excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Fertilizer needs are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to lean tundra soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial, but avoid over-fertilizing.
