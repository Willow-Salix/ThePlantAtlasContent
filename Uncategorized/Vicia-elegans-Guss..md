## Care Guide
Elegant Vetch, native to the Mediterranean climate of Southern Italy, requires full sun to partial shade and moderate watering during its active growth phase in spring and early summer. Being a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has low fertilizer needs and is tolerant of drier conditions once established, adapting to the region's dry summers.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, Vicia elegans Guss. fixes its own nitrogen from the atmosphere. Therefore, avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced, low-strength fertilizer may be applied sparingly if soil nutrients are very poor, otherwise, it generally requires little to no supplemental feeding.
