## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Kellogg's spurred lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native habitat on dry, open mountain slopes of Western North America. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it a low-maintenance plant suited for arid or semi-arid garden conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally no fertilizer needed due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. If growth is exceptionally poor, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
