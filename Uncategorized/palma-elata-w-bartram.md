## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Cabbage Palmetto thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for outdoor environments in subtropical to warm temperate regions. While drought-tolerant once established, young plants benefit from regular watering, and occasional feeding with a palm-specific fertilizer can support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; an application of a slow-release palm fertilizer in spring and summer is beneficial, especially for young palms or those in nutrient-poor soils.
