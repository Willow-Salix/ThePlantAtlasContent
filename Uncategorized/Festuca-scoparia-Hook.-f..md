## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pyrenees mountains (France, Spain, Andorra) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright, direct light for best growth, mimicking its open mountain environment. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil, especially during growing season. Tolerates some drought once established, but avoid waterlogging. Mimics natural mountain precipitation and good drainage. |

## Introduction
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## Care Guide
Bearskin Fescue is an alpine grass that thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils. It requires moderate, consistent watering, especially during its active growth period, but is intolerant of waterlogging. Minimal fertilization is needed to mimic its native mountain habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils. Apply a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer sparingly in spring, or skip if planted in rich soil.
