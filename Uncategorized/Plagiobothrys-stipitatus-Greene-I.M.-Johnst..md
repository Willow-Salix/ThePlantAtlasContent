## Introduction
Plagiobothrys is a genus of flowering plants known commonly as popcorn flowers. These are small herbaceous plants which bear tiny white or yellow flowers. Their fruits are nutlets. Although these plants are found predominantly in North America and South America, five species are known from Australia. Of the approximately 65 species described, more than 15 are endemic to California.

## Care Guide
This annual thrives in full sun and demands abundant moisture during its winter-to-spring growth cycle, emulating its native vernal pool environment. It then requires a completely dry period through the summer months for dormancy. Minimal fertilization is recommended.

### Fertilizer
Low; this plant is adapted to the nutrient-poor, seasonal soils of vernal pools. Excessive fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
