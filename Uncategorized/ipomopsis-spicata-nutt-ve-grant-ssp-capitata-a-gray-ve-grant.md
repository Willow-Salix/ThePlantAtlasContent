## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spiked Ipomopsis thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, typical of its arid native climate. It requires minimal watering, being highly drought-tolerant, and does not need regular fertilization. The overall care strategy is to replicate its dry, open, and nutrient-poor natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Adapted to lean, often rocky or sandy soils with minimal nutrient content.
