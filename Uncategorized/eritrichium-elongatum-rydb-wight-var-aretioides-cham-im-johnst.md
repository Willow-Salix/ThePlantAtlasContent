## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and very cool temperatures with extremely well-draining, lean soil. Replicate its harsh native environment by ensuring minimal water retention, good air circulation, and avoiding excessive heat and humidity. Provide minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils. Fertilize sparingly with a highly diluted, balanced fertilizer, if at all.
