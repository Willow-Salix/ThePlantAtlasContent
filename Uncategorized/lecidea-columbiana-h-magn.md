## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Rocky Outcrops |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating high light intensity as it grows on exposed rocks. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent; relies on natural precipitation (rain, fog, dew) and is highly drought tolerant, rehydrating quickly when moisture is available. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a crustose lichen found on exposed siliceous rocks across temperate Western North America, Lecidea columbiana thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly drought tolerant, absorbing moisture from rain and fog. It requires no soil or external fertilization, deriving all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere and its rock substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens are non-vascular and derive all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and minerals leached from the rock substrate.
