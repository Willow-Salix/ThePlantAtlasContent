## Introduction
Rorippa is a globally distributed genus in the family Brassicaceae, with species occurring on all continents except for Antarctica. Rorippa species are natively distributed in the Northern Hemisphere through Eurasia and North America, and dispersed into the Southern Hemisphere through long-distance dispersal. Rorippa species are annual to perennial herbs, usually with yellow flowers and a peppery flavour. They are known commonly as yellowcresses.

## Care Guide
This wetland native thrives in consistently wet soil and enjoys full sun to partial shade, mimicking its natural riparian habitat. Ensure high moisture levels and do not let the soil dry out. It requires moderate fertility to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. While adaptable to various soil conditions, it benefits from a general-purpose, balanced fertilizer, especially in nutrient-poor soils. It's naturally found in moderately fertile, often disturbed areas.
