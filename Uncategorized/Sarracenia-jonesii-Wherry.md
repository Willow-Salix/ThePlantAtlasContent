## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily North and South Carolina, historically also Georgia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Bog/Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily is ideal to promote vigorous growth and coloration). |
| **Watering** | Keep the soil consistently wet at all times, mimicking its bog habitat. Use only distilled water, rainwater, or reverse osmosis water, as tap water minerals can be harmful. |

## Introduction
Sarracenia ( or ) is a genus comprising 8 to 11 species of North American pitcher plants, commonly called trumpet pitchers. The genus belongs to the family Sarraceniaceae, which also contain the closely allied genera Darlingtonia and Heliamphora.
Sarracenia is a genus of carnivorous plants indigenous to the eastern seaboard of the United States, Texas, the Great Lakes area and southeastern Canada, with most species occurring only in the south-east United States (only S. purpurea occurs in cold-temperate regions). The plant's leaves have evolved into a funnel or pitcher shape in order to trap insects.
The plant attracts its insect prey with secretions from extrafloral nectaries on the lip of the pitcher leaves, as well as a combination of the leaves' color and scent. Slippery footing at the pitcher's rim causes insects to fall inside, where they die and are digested by the plant with proteases and other enzymes.

## Care Guide
Sarracenia jonesii thrives in perpetually wet, nutrient-poor, acidic conditions under full sun. Provide ample pure water (distilled, RO, or rain) and avoid fertilizing, as it captures its own nutrients from insects.

### Fertilizer
No soil fertilization is needed. These carnivorous plants obtain all necessary nutrients from the insects they catch in their pitchers, and soil fertilizers can harm their sensitive root systems.
