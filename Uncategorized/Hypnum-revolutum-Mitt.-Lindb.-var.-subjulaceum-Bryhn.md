## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and alpine regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America (e.g., Canada), Europe (e.g., Scandinavia), and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Filtered light to partial shade. In its native habitat, it can experience intense sun but often thrives in microclimates or under snowmelt, so protect from harsh direct sunlight, especially in warmer climates. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist conditions, mimicking the melting snow and high humidity of its native environment. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, and regular misting can help maintain ambient humidity. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, consistently moist environments with filtered light. Ensure the substrate remains damp but not waterlogged, mimicking its alpine tundra origins, and avoid direct harsh sunlight. Minimal to no fertilization is required due to its low nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Mosses have extremely low nutrient requirements. Fertilizer is generally not needed; if used, apply a very weak, highly diluted solution infrequently.
