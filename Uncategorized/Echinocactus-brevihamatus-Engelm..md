## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in extremely bright, direct sunlight, mimicking its native arid environment. It requires excellent drainage and minimal, infrequent watering to prevent root rot. Fertilize very sparingly only during its active growth period for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal nutrient needs. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
