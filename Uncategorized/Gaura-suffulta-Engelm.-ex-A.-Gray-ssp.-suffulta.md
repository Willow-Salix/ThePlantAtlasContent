## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South-central United States (Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico) and northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Prairie |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun is essential, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open prairie habitat. |
| **Watering** | Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant; water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in hot, dry periods. |

## Introduction
Gaura was a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae, native to North America.  The name was derived from Greek γαῦρος (gaûros) meaning "superb" and named in reference to the stature and floral display of some species in this genus.  The genus included many species known commonly as beeblossoms. Genetic research showed that the genus was paraphyletic unless the monotypic genus Stenosiphon is included within Gaura, increasing the number of species in the genus to 22.  Gaura is now a synonym of Oenothera, with the bulk of the Gaura taxa in genus Oenothera sect. Gaura (L.) W.L.Wagner &Hoch.
Gauras are annual, biennial or perennial herbaceous plants; most are perennials with sturdy rhizomes, often forming dense thickets, crowding or shading out other plant species. They have a basal rosette of leaves, with erect or spreading flowering stems up to 2 m (rarely more) tall, leafy on the lower stem, branched and leafless on the upper stem. The flowers have four (rarely three) petals; they are zygomorphic, with all the petals directed somewhat upwards. The fruit is an indehiscent nut-like body containing reddish-brown seeds. It reproduces via seeds and also by rhizome growth.

Species formerly in Gaura

Several species of the former Gaura are regarded as noxious weeds, especially in disturbed or overgrazed areas where it easily takes hold. They can become a nuisance in situations involving disturbed habitat, such as trampled rangeland and clearings. Efforts to control Gaura focus mainly on prevention of misuse of land. There is no biological control method for plants of genus Gaura, and removing existing infestations is difficult, due in large part to the plants' ability to reproduce from bits of rhizome left in the ground.
Despite the poor reputation of these plants, some species are cultivated as garden plants, such as G. lindheimeri (white gaura).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native prairie environment. It is remarkably drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering. Minimal fertilization is needed for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Generally low fertilizer needs; it thrives in average to poor soils and typically does not require much supplemental feeding.
