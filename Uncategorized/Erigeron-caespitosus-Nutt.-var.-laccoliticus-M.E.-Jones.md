## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland or Semi-Arid Montane Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; drought-tolerant once established. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, typical of arid environments. Requires excellent drainage to prevent rot. |

## Introduction
Erigeron () is a large genus of plants in the composite family (Asteraceae). It is placed in the tribe Astereae and is closely related to the Old World asters (Aster) and the true daisies (Bellis). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and the highest diversity occurs in North America.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright, full sun conditions, mimicking its native arid western North American habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established, needing well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum as it's adapted to poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, or with a very weak solution once a year in spring if growth appears sluggish.
