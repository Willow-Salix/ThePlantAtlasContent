## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern Oregon, United States (specifically Josephine and Jackson counties) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (specifically vernal pool and seasonally wet meadow habitats) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, as it grows in open, unshaded vernal pools and meadows. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture and often standing water during its active growing season (late winter through spring), followed by a complete dry period through summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Limnanthes, the type genus of the family Limnanthaceae, consists of annual herbaceous plants commonly known as the meadowfoams. The seven species are all native to coastal and adjoining regions (inland valleys, foothills and mountains) of western North America, where they typically grow in marshy habitats, such as the margins of vernal pools. Some are endemic to California.
General form ranges from decumbent to erect, with leaves either pinnately lobed or compound; the lobes or leaflets may themselves range from entire to deeply lobed. Both 4- and 5-sepaled and petaled members are known.
The white meadowfoam Limnanthes alba is of commercial interest for its oil, while several other species are rare or endangered. Honey produced by bees that pollinate Limnanthes alba has the distinct flavor of toasted marshmallows.
L. douglasii is widely cultivated as a hardy annual, its white and yellow flower colour giving it the common name of poached egg plant.

## Care Guide
This annual thrives in full sun conditions, replicating its native open habitats. It needs a distinct wet period, with consistent moisture or standing water from late winter to spring, followed by a complete dry spell during summer dormancy. It is adapted to lean soils and generally requires minimal to no supplemental fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. These plants are adapted to naturally lean or moderately fertile soils found in their native vernal pool environments.
