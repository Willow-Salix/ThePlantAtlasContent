| **Native Origin** | Caucasus Mountains (Turkey, Georgia, Russia) and parts of Siberia |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Forests / Woodland understory |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade, especially in warmer climates, mimicking its native dappled woodland light. |

## Introduction
Brunnera is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. They are rhizomatous perennials, native to the woodlands of Eastern Europe and North West Asia. They have hairy leaves and sprays of blue flowers in spring. Numerous cultivars are available, which are valued as groundcover in dappled shade. Some possess variegated foliage. The best known species is B. macrophylla, known as Siberian bugloss.
The genus name honors the Swiss botanist Samuel Brunner. The common name "bugloss", meaning ox tongue, originates from Greek and probably refers to the texture and shape of the leaves.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments reminiscent of its native woodland floor. Provide consistent moisture and protect it from harsh afternoon sun to prevent leaf scorch. A spring application of compost or fertilizer supports robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with organic matter or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, as its native woodland soils are often rich in decaying plant material.
