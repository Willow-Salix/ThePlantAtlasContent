The Akoko are a large Yoruba cultural sub-group in the Northeastern part of Yorubaland. The area spans from Ondo State to Edo State in southwest Nigeria. The Akokos as a subgroup make up 20.3% of the population of Ondo State, and 5.7% of the population of Edo State. Out of the present 18 Local Government Councils it constitutes four; Akoko North-East, Akoko North-West, Akoko South-East and Akoko South-West, as well as the Akoko Edo LGA of Edo State. The Adekunle Ajasin University, a state owned university with a capacity for about 20,000 tertiary education students and more than 50 departments in seven faculties is located in Akungba-Akoko. A state specialist hospital is situated at Ikare Akoko, while community general hospitals are located in Oka-Akoko, Irun-Akoko and Ipe-Akoko.

## Care Guide
This rare Hawaiian spurge thrives in bright light and prefers well-draining soil, characteristic of its native dry to mesic shrubland habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings, and fertilize lightly during the active growing season to mimic its natural nutrient availability.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, diluted fertilizer during the growing season
