| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (including California, Pacific Northwest, and intermountain West), parts of South America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grasslands, Mediterranean Climate (wet winters/springs, dry summers) |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure, prefers full sun for optimal growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth (cooler, wetter seasons), becomes drought-tolerant as it matures and can withstand dry summer conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Foxtail Fescue is an annual grass native to western North America, thriving in full sun exposures typical of grasslands and open woodlands. It requires moderate watering during its active growth in cooler, wetter seasons and is highly drought-tolerant in dry summers. This plant has low fertilizer requirements, adapting well to average soil nutrient levels.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; it typically thrives in average to poor soil nutrient conditions.
