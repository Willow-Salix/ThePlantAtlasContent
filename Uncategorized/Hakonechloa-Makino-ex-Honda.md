## Care Guide
Hakone grass thrives in partial to full shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native Japanese forest understory habitat. Protect it from intense afternoon sun and provide regular watering to prevent drying out. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring supports healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced slow-release granular fertilizer or a diluted liquid feed applied in spring.
