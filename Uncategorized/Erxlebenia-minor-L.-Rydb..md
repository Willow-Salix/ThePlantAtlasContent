*Erxlebenia minor (L.) Rydb.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Oregon, California, Utah), based on historical records for its synonym Vicia minor. |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid to Mediterranean, characterized by dry ground conditions, especially during summers. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as typically found in dry, open habitats in its native range. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate watering; tolerant of dry conditions. Water sparingly once established, especially during warm, dry periods, mimicking its native adaptation to seasonal rainfall and dry ground. |

## Care Guide
This plant, historically known from dry grounds of Western North America, prefers full sun and low to moderate watering, tolerating drought. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its adaptation to less rich native soils. Provide well-draining soil to mimic its natural habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native dry ground soils are often not exceptionally rich; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied sparingly once a year or during active growth is sufficient.
