# Bartramia Moss

*Bartramia ithyphylla Brid.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in Temperate and Cold Regions of the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, Asia, North America) and parts of the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., New Zealand, Australia, Southern South America) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest, Subalpine/Montane regions |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Shade to Full Shade. Prefers indirect light or dappled shade; direct, intense sun will scorch and dry it out. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, but not waterlogged, substrate. Requires high humidity and frequent misting or watering to prevent drying out. |

## Introduction
Bartramia may refer to either of two genera:

## Care Guide
Bartramia moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded environments, mimicking its native temperate and subalpine habitats. Ensure the substrate remains damp and provide high humidity, while avoiding direct sunlight and heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Mosses are low-nutrient plants; if used, a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly once or twice a year.
