## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rocky Mountain Columbine flourishes in cool, moist, and well-drained environments, typical of its high-altitude native habitat. Provide full sun to partial shade, ensuring soil moisture is consistent without being waterlogged. A light application of fertilizer in spring promotes robust growth and prolific flowering.
