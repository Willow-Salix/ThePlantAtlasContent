## Care Guide
Gomphillus lichens thrive in high humidity and consistently moist conditions, mimicking their native tropical rainforest habitat. They require low to moderate, indirect light and generally do not need fertilization, as they absorb nutrients from the air and environment.

### Fertilizer
Generally none; lichens absorb trace nutrients from the air and environment and are sensitive to added fertilizers.
