## 🌱 Overview
Lycopodium (from Ancient Greek lykos, wolf and podion, diminutive of pous, foot) is a genus of clubmosses, also known as ground pines or creeping cedars, in the family Lycopodiaceae. Two very different circumscriptions of the genus are in use. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Lycopodium is one of nine genera in the subfamily Lycopodioideae, and has from nine to 15 species. In other classifications, the genus is equivalent to the whole of the subfamily, since it includes all of the other genera. More than 40 species are accepted.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Carolina Clubmoss thrives in bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native wetland and savanna habitats. It prefers high humidity and requires only infrequent, diluted fertilization to maintain its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder. Use a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season, or a slow-release granular fertilizer every few months. Avoid over-fertilizing.
