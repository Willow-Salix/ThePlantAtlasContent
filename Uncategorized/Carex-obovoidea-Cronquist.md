Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Obovoid Sedge thrives in consistently wet soil conditions, mirroring its native temperate wetland habitats in Western North America. It prefers partial sun to bright indirect light, though it can tolerate full sun if kept adequately watered. Fertilization needs are low to moderate, emphasizing the importance of consistent moisture over high nutrient input for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season (spring/early summer). Over-fertilization should be avoided.
