## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Sierra Nevada, Cascade Range) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | High light / Full sun exposure, mimicking its native habitat on exposed rocks in montane to alpine zones. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular ambient moisture from misting or high humidity, allowing for intermittent drying periods. Good air circulation is crucial to prevent fungal growth; avoid prolonged wetness or stagnant conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Fuscidea is a genus of crustose lichens in the family Fuscideaceae. It has about 40 species. The genus was circumscribed in 1972 by lichenologists Volkmar Wirth and Antonín Vězda, with Fuscidea aggregatilis assigned as the type species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Fuscidea lowensis, provide conditions that replicate its high-altitude, exposed rock habitat: abundant light and cool temperatures. Ensure frequent atmospheric moisture via misting or high humidity, but critically allow for periods of dryness with excellent air circulation. No fertilizers are needed, as lichens are highly sensitive to external nutrient sources.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None; lichens are highly self-sufficient, deriving nutrients from the atmosphere and rainwater, and are extremely sensitive to any added fertilizers.
