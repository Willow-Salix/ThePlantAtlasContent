## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for this lichen, replicate its temperate rainforest habitat by providing very low, indirect light and maintaining consistently high humidity. Ensure regular misting or a humid enclosure, and avoid traditional fertilization, as it absorbs nutrients directly from the environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed; lichens obtain essential nutrients from atmospheric particles, rain, and the substrate they grow on (bark, decaying wood).
