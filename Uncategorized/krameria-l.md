## 🌱 Overview
Krameria is the only genus in the family Krameriaceae, of which any of the approximately 17–18 species. The genus is named after the Austrian botanist Johann Georg Heinrich Kramer (1684-1744).
The species are commonly known as rhatany, ratany or rattany. Rhatany is also the name given to krameria root, a botanical remedy consisting of the dried root of para rhatany (Krameria argentea) or Peruvian rhatany (Krameria lappacea).
The biological action of rhatany is caused by the astringent rhataniatannic acid, which is similar to tannic acid. Infusions have been used as a gargle, a lozenge, especially when mixed with cocaine, as a local hemostatic and remedy for diarrhea. When finely powdered, the dried roots furnished a frequent constituent of tooth powders. The powdered roots have also served, especially in Portugal, to color wines ruby red. The root bark contains an almost insoluble free red substance called ratanhia red.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ratany plants thrive in conditions mimicking their native arid habitats, demanding full sun exposure and excellent drainage. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing as they are adapted to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. If necessary, a very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once a year during the growing season.
