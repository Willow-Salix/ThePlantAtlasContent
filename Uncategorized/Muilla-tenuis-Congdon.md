## Care Guide
The Slender Muilla thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. It requires regular watering during its winter and spring growing season but must experience a dry summer dormancy to prevent bulb rot. Fertilization should be light and infrequent.

### Fertilizer
Prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soil. Minimal fertilization is needed; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once during its active growth phase is sufficient, or none at all in nutrient-rich soils.
