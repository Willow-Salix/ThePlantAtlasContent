## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Utah, United States (endemic to San Juan County) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert (Pinyon-Juniper Woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in exposed canyonlands and open woodlands. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; requires infrequent, deep watering. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic its native arid climate. Avoid overwatering and waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
The Red Canyon Beardtongue thrives in full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its native arid canyonlands environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering only when the soil is dry. Fertilization is rarely needed for this plant.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertility needs. Thrives in lean, rocky, well-draining soils. Fertilizer is generally not necessary, or a very light, balanced application once in spring if growth is lacking.
