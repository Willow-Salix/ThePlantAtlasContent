## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hall's Arthothelium Lichen thrives in cool, humid, and shaded environments, mirroring its temperate rainforest origin. Provide low to moderate indirect light and maintain high atmospheric moisture through regular misting or a terrarium-like setup. As a lichen, it obtains nutrients from the air and rain, so traditional fertilization is unnecessary and clean environmental conditions are paramount.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization required. Lichens obtain nutrients from atmospheric deposition (rain and air). Ensure clean air and water sources.
