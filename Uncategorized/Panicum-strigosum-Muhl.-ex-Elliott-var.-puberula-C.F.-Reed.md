## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (found in open pinelands, savannas, and sandy woods) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, reflecting its native open habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil, allowing the top inch or two to dry out between waterings. Tolerates some drought once established due to its adaptable nature in sandy soils. |

## Care Guide
This southeastern US native thrives in full to partial sun and well-drained, sandy soils, characteristic of its humid subtropical origin. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and has low fertilizer needs. It is a resilient grass well-suited to conditions mimicking its open, often disturbed, natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils typical of its native pineland habitats. A light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring, if any, is sufficient.
