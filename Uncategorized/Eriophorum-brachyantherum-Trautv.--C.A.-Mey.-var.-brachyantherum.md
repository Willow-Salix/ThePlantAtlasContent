## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions across Eurasia and North America, including Siberia, northern China, Alaska, and Canada. |
| **Climate** | Arctic/Subarctic Tundra and Boreal Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial sun, typical of open tundra and bog environments with extended daylight during growing seasons. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist to saturated soil, mimicking its native boggy habitat. Should never be allowed to dry out and can tolerate standing water. |

## Introduction
Eriophorum (cottongrass, cotton-grass or cottonsedge) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae, the sedge family. They are found in the cool temperate, alpine, and Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, primarily in the middle latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in consistently wet to saturated soil, characteristic of its native arctic and subarctic bog habitats. Provide full to partial sun exposure and avoid rich fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Native bog and tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor. Minimal or no fertilization is generally needed.
