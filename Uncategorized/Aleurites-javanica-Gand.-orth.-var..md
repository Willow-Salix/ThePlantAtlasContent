| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia (e.g., Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines), extending into parts of Oceania. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest / Humid Subtropical |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth, especially as a mature tree, but can tolerate partial shade, particularly when young or in very hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular and consistent watering to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. It thrives in conditions of high humidity and abundant rainfall, characteristic of its native tropical environment. |

## Introduction
Aleurites moluccanus, commonly known as candlenut, Indian walnut or, in Hawaii, kukui, is a tree in the spurge family Euphorbiaceae. It grows to about 30 m (98 ft) tall and produces drupe fruit.
First described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, the species' origin is unclear due to its spread by humans, but it can be found in many tropical rainforests and gallery forests. Various parts of the plant have regional or cultural uses.

## Care Guide
This tropical tree thrives in warm, humid conditions with abundant sunlight and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide regular watering and moderate feeding during its active growth phases to support its robust development, mimicking its native rainforest habitat.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growing season (spring and summer). A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or organic compost can support its vigorous growth.
