## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar, particularly in mountainous and high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., Alps, Rocky Mountains, Scandinavia, Arctic). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Boreal/Subarctic rocky outcrops, characterized by cool temperatures, exposed conditions, and often periods of snow cover. |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure, often full sun on exposed rock surfaces; tolerant of some partial shade found in its natural habitat. |
| **Watering** | Relies on atmospheric moisture (rain, snowmelt, dew, fog). Requires regular wetting and drying cycles, not constant saturation. Good air circulation is crucial, and it is highly tolerant of prolonged dry periods. |

## Introduction
Rhizocarpon is a genus of crustose, saxicolous (or sometimes lichenicolous), lecideoid lichens in the family Rhizocarpaceae. The genus is common in arctic-alpine environments, but also occurs throughout temperate, subtropical, and even tropical regions. They are commonly known as map lichens because of the prothallus forming border-like bands between colonies in some species, like the common map lichen (Rhizocarpon geographicum).

## Care Guide
Mimic its natural environment of cool, exposed rocky areas with ample light and good air circulation. Provide intermittent moisture through high humidity, regular wetting, and allowing it to dry out between periods of hydration, avoiding constant saturation. Fertilization is not required as it sources nutrients from the air and its substrate.

### Fertilizer
No fertilization needed. Obtains essential nutrients from airborne particles, dissolved minerals in precipitation, and the rock substrate itself.
