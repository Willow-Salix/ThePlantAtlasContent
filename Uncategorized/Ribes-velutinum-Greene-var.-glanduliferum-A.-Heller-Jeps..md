## Care Guide
Sticky Currant is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub suited for full sun to partial shade in well-drained, lean soils. Once established, it requires minimal watering and fertilization, thriving with infrequent attention. This makes it ideal for xeriscaping or native plant gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean, well-drained soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, especially with a slow-release formula in spring if growth is weak.
