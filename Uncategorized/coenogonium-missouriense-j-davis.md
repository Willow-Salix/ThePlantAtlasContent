## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Appalachian regions) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (specifically, consistently high humidity microclimates within deeply shaded forests, ravines, and bluffs) |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low light; requires deep shade and protection from any direct sunlight, which can cause desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity is paramount; requires consistent moisture from the air or misting, not tolerant of drying out. Needs a constantly moist environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Coenogonium is a genus of filamentous lichens in the monotypic family Coenogoniaceae. It has about 90 species. Most species are leaf-dwelling or grow on bark, although a few are known to grow on rocks under certain conditions, and some are restricted to growth on termite nests. The genus was circumscribed in 1820 by German naturalist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg.
Coenogonium has a worldwide distribution, with most species known from tropical areas. Most species grow in tropical rainforests in the shaded understorey. They typically grow on tree trunks, branches, lianas, and leaves.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This delicate lichen thrives in stable, deeply shaded, and consistently humid environments, mimicking its native habitat on forest floors or rock overhangs. Protect it from direct light and ensure high atmospheric moisture through misting or a humid enclosure, as it is intolerant to drying out. Avoid conventional fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required; obtains nutrients from atmospheric deposition and its substrate. Fertilization is generally detrimental.
