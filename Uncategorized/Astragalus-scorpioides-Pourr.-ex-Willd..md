| **Climate** | Mediterranean climate (hot, dry summers; mild, wet winters) in rocky areas, grasslands, and scrublands. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) to replicate its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during the hot, dry summer months. Requires more moisture during its cooler growing season but dislikes waterlogged conditions. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean habitat. It is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, particularly during hot summers. Fertilizer needs are minimal due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Apply a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring only if soil is very poor, otherwise not typically required.
