## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, particularly the Appalachian Mountains region |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch fronds. Mimics the dappled light of a forest understory or shaded rock face. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry. Good drainage is crucial, and high humidity is beneficial. |

## Introduction
Asplenium is a genus of about 700 species of ferns, often treated as the only genus in the family Aspleniaceae, though other authors consider Hymenasplenium separate, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, a different chromosome count, and structural differences in the rhizomes. The type species for the genus is Asplenium marinum.
The most common vernacular name is spleenworts, applied to the more "typical" species. A. nidus and several similar species are called bird's-nest ferns, the Camptosorus group is known as walking ferns, and distinct names are applied to some other particularly well-known species.

## Care Guide
Asplenium Ã—trudellii thrives in environments mimicking its native temperate forest habitat in Eastern North America. Provide consistent moisture, high humidity, and low to medium indirect light, ensuring good drainage. Fertilize sparingly to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Fertilize sparingly, perhaps once a month during the growing season (spring/summer) with a half-strength balanced liquid fertilizer. Over-fertilization can harm roots.
