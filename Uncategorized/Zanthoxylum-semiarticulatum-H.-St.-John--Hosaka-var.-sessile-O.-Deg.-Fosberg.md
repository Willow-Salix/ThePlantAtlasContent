## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry to Mesic Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to full sun, typical of a forest edge or open canopy where it receives substantial sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Allow the top soil to dry out completely between waterings, then water thoroughly. Reduce watering frequency significantly during cooler or dormant periods to mimic natural dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Zanthoxylum is a genus of about 250 species of deciduous and evergreen trees, shrubs and climbers in the family Rutaceae that are native to warm temperate and subtropical areas worldwide. It is the type genus of the tribe Zanthoxyleae in the subfamily Rutoideae. Several of the species have yellow heartwood, to which their generic name alludes. Several species are cultivated for their use as spices, notably including Sichuan pepper.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical dry to mesic forest habitat, preferring bright light exposure. It requires consistent watering during its active growing season, with the soil allowed to dry between applications, and significantly reduced watering during dormancy. Provide moderate fertilization for optimal growth and health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied during its active growing season (spring and summer).
