## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (Temperate Grassland/Oak Woodland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, typically in open, exposed grasslands or sparse woodland edges. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during the cool, wet growing season (winter and spring) to mimic native rainfall. Reduce or cease watering during the hot, dry summer months as the plant may go dormant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Columbia Clover thrives in a Mediterranean climate, requiring full sun and consistent moisture during its active growth in the cooler, wetter months. It tolerates the dry summer by potentially going dormant, needing significantly reduced water. As a nitrogen-fixer, its fertilizer needs are low, especially for nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil and does not require high nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced, low-dose fertilizer can be applied if soil is exceptionally poor, but it is generally not essential.
