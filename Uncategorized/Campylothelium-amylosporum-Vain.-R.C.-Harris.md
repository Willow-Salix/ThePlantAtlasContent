## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical regions worldwide, including parts of South America (e.g., Amazon Basin), Southeast Asia, and Oceania |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Filtered light to partial shade, avoiding direct intense sun, as it typically grows on tree bark or leaves in the understory. |
| **Watering** | Consistently high humidity is crucial, absorbing moisture directly from the air and rainfall; no traditional 'watering' is applied. |

## Introduction
Astrothelium is a large genus of corticolous (bark-dwelling) lichens in the family Trypetheliaceae. The genus is characterized by a corticate thallus and diverse ascomata structures, which can be simple, aggregated, or forming pseudostromata. Astrothelium is also notable for the carbonized walls of its ascomata, the so-called textura intricata (i.e., tightly interwoven) arrangement of cells in these walls, and various forms of distoseptate, transparent spores.

## Care Guide
To care for this lichen, recreate a high-humidity, warm environment with filtered light, typical of a tropical rainforest understory. Ensure constant atmospheric moisture and avoid direct sunlight. No traditional watering or fertilization is required, as it gathers nutrients from its surroundings.

### Fertilizer
Minimal nutrient requirements, deriving sustenance from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust) and its substrate; no conventional fertilization is needed.
