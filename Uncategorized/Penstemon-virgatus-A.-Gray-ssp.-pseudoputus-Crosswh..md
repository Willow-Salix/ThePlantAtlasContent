## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This Penstemon thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native semi-arid montane habitat. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant for appropriate conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization can reduce flowering and plant vigor.
