## Introduction
Rubus is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, subfamily Rosoideae, most commonly known as brambles. Fruits of various species are known as raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, and bristleberries. It is a diverse genus, with the estimated number of Rubus species varying from 250 to over 1000, found across all continents except Antarctica.
Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles like roses; spines, bristles, and gland-tipped hairs are also common in the genus. The Rubus fruit, sometimes called a bramble fruit, is an aggregate of drupelets. The term cane fruit or cane berry applies to any Rubus species or hybrid which is commonly grown with supports such as wires or canes, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry. The stems of such plants are also referred to as canes.

## Care Guide
Rubus univocus, or Allegheny Blackberry, is an adaptable plant from temperate Eastern North America, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It requires consistent moisture, particularly during the growing and fruiting seasons, but can tolerate some drought. Its low to moderate fertilizer needs are best met with well-drained, average soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average soil and may benefit from an annual application of balanced fertilizer or compost in early spring, particularly in nutrient-poor soils. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
