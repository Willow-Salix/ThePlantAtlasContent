### *Pertusaria dactylina (Ach.) Nyl.*

![Pore Lichen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Pertusaria_paratuberculifera_124712.jpg)

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions; high-altitude alpine zones across North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | High light conditions, including direct sun for several hours, but adaptable to partial shade. Prefers cooler temperatures and can be sensitive to prolonged intense heat and dryness. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and periodic direct wetting from rainfall, snowmelt, or fog. Should be allowed to dry out completely between wetting cycles, as constant dampness can lead to issues. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pertusaria is a large genus of warty crustose lichens in the Pertusariaceae family. The fruiting bodies are usually modified apothecia that immersed in warts on the main body (thallus) with small holes for the spores to emerge, similar to ostioles, or are fully above and lecanorine (spore bearing discs surrounded by a ring of tissue similar to the tissue of the thallus.  Members of the genus are commonly called wart lichens.
The widespread genus contains over 500 species.
Classification in the large genus relies heavily on thallus chemistry to distinguish and classify species, some of which differ only in the presence or absence of a single secondary chemical. Lichexanthone, norlichexanthone, and their chlorinated derivatives are common in this genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pertusaria dactylina thrives in cool, high-light environments mimicking its native alpine and arctic tundra. It requires high atmospheric humidity and periodic direct wetting, followed by complete drying. Avoid any fertilization, as this lichen is highly sensitive to external nutrients and prefers pristine air quality.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed. Lichens are extremely sensitive to nutrient pollution and rely on atmospheric deposition for minimal requirements.
