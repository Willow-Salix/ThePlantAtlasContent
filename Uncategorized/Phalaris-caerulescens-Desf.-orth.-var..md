## Care Guide
Blue Canary Grass thrives in full sun and prefers consistently moist soil conditions. While it can tolerate short periods of drought once established, regular watering is key for lush growth. Fertilize sparingly to support its natural vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; typically grows in naturally fertile soils but may benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season in poor soils.
