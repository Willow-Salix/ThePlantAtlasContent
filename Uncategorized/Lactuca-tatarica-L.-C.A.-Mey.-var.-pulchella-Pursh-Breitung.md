## Care Guide
Blue Lettuce thrives in full sun exposure, mimicking its native prairie and open woodland habitats. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization. This adaptable plant is relatively low-maintenance, flourishing in average soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. It is not a heavy feeder and often thrives in average to moderately fertile soils. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring if desired.
