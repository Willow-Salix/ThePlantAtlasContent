## Introduction
Begonia  is a genus of perennial flowering plants in the family Begoniaceae. The genus contains more than 2,000 different plant species.

In cooler climates some species are cultivated outside in summertime for their bright colorful flowers, which have petals but no sepals.

## Care Guide
Wax Begonias thrive in bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting their humid subtropical origins. Provide regular fertilization during active growth to support their prolific blooming. Ensure good air circulation and protect from direct, harsh sunlight and excessive watering.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize regularly during the growing season (spring through fall) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, typically every 2-4 weeks.
