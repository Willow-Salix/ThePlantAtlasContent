## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (e.g., Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, Wyoming) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open, arid native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Low; drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot, mimicking natural infrequent heavy rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sheldon's Cryptantha is a drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and dry conditions, reflecting its native arid scrubland environment. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions, and has very low fertilizer needs, preferring lean soil. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent any issues with excess moisture.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in lean, well-draining soils. Light fertilization once a year in spring with a diluted all-purpose fertilizer, or none at all, is generally sufficient.
