## Care Guide
This Coreopsis thrives in full sun, reflecting its native open, sunny habitats in Southern Mexico's dry forests and grasslands. It requires moderate to low watering, tolerating dry spells after establishment due to its adaptation to seasonal rainfall. Fertilization needs are low to moderate, as it's accustomed to less nutrient-rich soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate fertilizer. These plants thrive in average to somewhat poor soils and do not require heavy feeding; excessive fertilizer can lead to leggy growth.
