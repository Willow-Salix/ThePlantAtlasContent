## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires infrequent, deep watering, tolerating drought conditions. Fertilization is generally unnecessary due to its adaptation to lean desert soils. Ensure excellent drainage for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; if necessary, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once during the spring growing season.
