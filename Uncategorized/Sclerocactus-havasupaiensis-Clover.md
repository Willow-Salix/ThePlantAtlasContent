## Introduction

## Care Guide
The Havasupai Cactus thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid desert habitat. Provide abundant full sun and infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions. Fertilizer needs are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor desert soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. If fertilized, use a low-nitrogen, diluted cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season.
