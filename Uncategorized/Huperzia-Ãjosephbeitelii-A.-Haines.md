## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern North America (specifically regions like New England, Great Lakes, and Appalachians where parent species like Huperzia lucidula and Huperzia selago co-occur) |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest (often in montane to subalpine zones) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium light; partial to full shade. Direct, intense sunlight should be avoided. |
| **Watering** | Keep the substrate consistently moist but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. High ambient humidity is crucial, potentially requiring frequent watering or misting. |

## Introduction
Lycopodiopsida is a class of vascular plants also known as lycopsids, lycopods, or lycophytes. Members of the class are also called clubmosses, firmosses, spikemosses and quillworts. They have dichotomously branching stems bearing simple leaves called microphylls and reproduce by means of spores borne in sporangia on the sides of the stems at the bases of the leaves. Although living species are small, during the Carboniferous, extinct tree-like forms (Lepidodendrales) formed huge forests that dominated the landscape and contributed to coal deposits.
The nomenclature and classification of plants with microphylls varies substantially among authors. A consensus classification for extant (living) species was produced in 2016 by the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group (PPG I), which places them all in the class Lycopodiopsida, which includes the classes Isoetopsida and Selaginellopsida used in other systems. (See Table 2.) Alternative classification systems have used ranks from division (phylum) to subclass. In the PPG I system, the class is divided into three orders, Lycopodiales, Isoetales and Selaginellales.

## Care Guide
This clubmoss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded environments, mimicking its native forest floor habitat. Ensure high humidity, well-drained acidic substrate, and very minimal fertilization to prevent nutrient burn.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Fertilize sparingly, perhaps once or twice a year, using a highly diluted (1/4 strength or less) balanced liquid fertilizer.
