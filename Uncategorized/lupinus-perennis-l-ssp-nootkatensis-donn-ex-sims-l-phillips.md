## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Nootka Lupine flourishes in cool, moist temperate climates with ample sunlight to partial shade. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native habitat's rainfall. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it needs minimal to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to None (as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in poor soils and can be harmed by high nitrogen fertilizer)
