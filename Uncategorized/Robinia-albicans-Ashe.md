## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Appalachia, Ozarks) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily). This plant is shade intolerant and thrives in open, brightly lit conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering when young to establish. Once mature, it is drought-tolerant, preferring consistent moisture but not waterlogging, aligning with typical temperate rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Robinia pseudoacacia, commonly known as black locust, is a medium-sized hardwood deciduous tree, belonging to the tribe Robinieae of the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to a few small areas of the United States, but it has been widely planted and naturalized elsewhere in temperate North America, southern Europe, Southern Africa and Southern Asia and is considered an invasive species in some areas, such as the temperate east coast of Australia where the cultivar "Frisia" (Golden Robinia) was widely planted as a street tree before being classed as a weed. Another common name is false acacia, a literal translation of the specific name (pseudo [Greek ψευδο-] meaning fake or false and acacia referring to the genus of plants with the same name).
It is a native North American genus, but traces of it are found in the Eocene and Miocene rocks of Europe.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Black Locust is a robust tree that demands full sun exposure to thrive, reflecting its pioneer nature in native deciduous forests. It requires well-draining soil and, once established, is quite drought-tolerant, making it low-maintenance regarding water. Being a nitrogen-fixer, it needs little to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer typically needed. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil and generally does not require supplementary feeding; excessive nitrogen can be detrimental.
