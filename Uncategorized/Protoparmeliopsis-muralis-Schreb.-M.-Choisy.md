| **Native Origin** | Cosmopolitan; widespread across temperate regions globally, including Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia, often thriving in urban environments. |
| **Climate** | Temperate zones, adaptable to a range of conditions from open, exposed habitats to moderately shaded areas. Experiences seasonal changes with moderate rainfall. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade, typically found in exposed locations on rocks, walls, and other hard, well-lit surfaces. Requires good air circulation. |
| **Watering** | Relies entirely on natural rainfall, dew, and atmospheric humidity for moisture. It does not require artificial watering and can tolerate prolonged periods of desiccation, rehydrating when moisture is available. |

## Care Guide
As a lichen, Protoparmeliopsis muralis thrives outdoors on hard surfaces like rocks or walls in temperate climates. It requires full to partial sun, good air circulation, and natural rainfall/humidity cycles for moisture absorption. It cannot be cultivated as a typical potted plant and does not need soil, watering, or fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Does not require fertilization. Obtains all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition, dust, and rainwater. Sensitive to air pollution but not nutrient deficiency.
