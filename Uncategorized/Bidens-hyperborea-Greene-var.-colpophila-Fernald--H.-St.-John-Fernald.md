## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Atlantic coast of Eastern Canada (e.g., Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia) and Northeastern United States (e.g., Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont, New Jersey), specifically in brackish tidal estuaries. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Estuarine Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Shade (prefers open, well-lit estuarine environments) |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil, tolerant of periodic inundation and brackish water conditions. Mimic tidal fluctuations if possible. |

## Introduction
Bidens is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. The genus include roughly 230 species which are distributed worldwide. Despite their global distribution, the systematics and taxonomy of the genus has been described as complicated and unorganized. The common names beggarticks, black jack, burr marigolds, cobbler's pegs, Spanish needles, stickseeds, tickseeds and tickseed sunflowers refer to the fruits of the plants, most of which are bristly and barbed. The generic name refers to the same character; Bidens comes from the Latin bi ("two") and dens ("tooth").

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring perpetually moist to wet conditions, ideally mimicking its native brackish tidal estuary environment. It benefits from nutrient-rich soil typical of riverbanks and tidal flats.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Estuarine soils are often rich in organic matter due to tidal deposition and nutrient accumulation from runoff.
