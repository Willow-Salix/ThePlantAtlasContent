## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, mimicking its open desert habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant, more frequent in active growth (spring/summer), very little to none in dormancy (winter). |

## Introduction
Pelecyphora, pincushion cactus or foxtail cactus is a genus of cacti, comprising 20 species. They originate from Mexico and the United States.
Common species include the Missouri foxtail cactus P. missouriensis, widespread in grassland and forest west of the Mississippi, and the spinystar P. vivipara, distributed across the US and into Canada, first described by Nuttall in 1813.

## Care Guide
Lee's Pincushion Cactus thrives in conditions mimicking its native high desert. Provide abundant direct sunlight and ensure excellent drainage. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and fertilize minimally during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilization, only during the active growing season (spring/summer). Use a diluted, balanced cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice a year.
