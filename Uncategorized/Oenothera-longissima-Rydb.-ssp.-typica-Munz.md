## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (specifically Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland, High Desert, Montane Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. Thrives in direct, unfiltered sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily, typical of its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low. Extremely drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking sporadic rainfall in arid environments. |

## Introduction
Oenothera is a genus of about 145 species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas. It is the type genus of the family Onagraceae.  Common names include evening primrose, suncups, and sundrops. They are not closely related to the true primroses (genus Primula).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and dry conditions, indicative of its arid and high-desert native climate. Provide well-draining soil and water sparingly once established, allowing for drought periods. Minimal fertilization is needed.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adaptable to lean soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer once in spring, or none at all if soil is moderately fertile, is sufficient.
