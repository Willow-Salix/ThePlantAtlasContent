## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, including Central and South America, Southeast Asia, and Pacific Islands. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Rainforests, particularly montane cloud forests and wet lowland forests. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade or bright, indirect light; avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch delicate fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist, as the plant thrives in its naturally high-rainfall native environment. High ambient humidity is crucial, and the growing medium should never dry out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Grammitis (dwarf polypody) is a genus of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae, subfamily Grammitidoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). It had formerly been placed in the family Grammitidaceae, but this family is no longer recognized by most authors because phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences have shown that it is embedded in Polypodiaceae.
The delimitation of Grammitis was drastically narrowed in the first decade of the 21st century. It now contains about 25 species. In 2003, a study of the distribution of grammitid ferns placed 11 species in the New World, 7 in Africa, and 4 in the Pacific.
The genus Grammitis was established by Olof Swartz around 1801. (sources vary on the exact date). The name is derived from Greek, gramma, grammatos meaning "a line or thread" and refers to the arrangement of the sori in some species. The  type species for Grammitis is Grammitis marginella.
The only known fossil of a grammitid fern has been named Grammitis succinea, but it is not clear that it belongs to Grammitis as more recently defined. It was found in Oligocene amber from the Dominican Republic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Dwarf Polypody, provide high humidity and consistently moist growing conditions, mimicking its native rainforest habitat. Position it in a location with bright, indirect light or partial to full shade, avoiding direct sun, and fertilize sparingly during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a diluted liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer) is sufficient; many epiphytic species obtain nutrients from decaying organic matter and require less.
