## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions, including Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically, the microclimate within such forests conducive to its host lichens) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light, mimicking the dappled shade of a forest canopy or shaded rock surfaces. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and regular moisture, avoiding periods of complete desiccation or waterlogging. Mimic natural rainfall and dew cycles typical of a temperate forest floor or bark. |

## Introduction
Sphaerellothecium is a genus of fungi in the family Phyllachoraceae. All of the species in the genus are lichenicolous, meaning they grow parasitically on lichens.

## Care Guide
This lichenicolous fungus thrives in conditions mimicking its temperate forest habitat, requiring consistent high humidity and indirect light. Nutrient provision comes directly from its host lichen, making traditional fertilization irrelevant. Ensure stable, moist conditions without waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable, as this is a lichenicolous fungus (grows on lichens) and derives nutrients from its host, not from soil. Standard fertilizers are not suitable and may be harmful.
