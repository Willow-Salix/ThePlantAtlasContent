## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal areas of Western Europe, particularly the British Isles (e.g., Isle of Wight, Channel Islands), France, Belgium, and Netherlands. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Maritime (typically found on calcareous coastal cliffs, banks, or dunes) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate some direct morning or late afternoon sun, especially if humidity is high, but avoid intense midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged. High atmospheric humidity is crucial; regular misting or placement in a humid environment (e.g., terrarium) is beneficial. Do not allow to dry out completely. |

## Care Guide
This rare moss thrives in cool, humid conditions with consistent moisture and good air circulation. It prefers bright indirect to partial sun and a well-draining, calcareous substrate. Fertilization is generally not required, mimicking its natural, nutrient-poor coastal habitat.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs; if fertilizing, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly, perhaps once a year.
