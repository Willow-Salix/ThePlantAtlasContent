## Introduction
Acalypha is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is the sole genus of the subtribe Acalyphinae. It is one of the largest euphorb genera, with approximately 450 to 462 species. The genus name Acalypha is from the Ancient Greek ἀκαλύφη (akalúphē) ("nettle"), an alternative form of ἀκαλήφη (akalḗphē), and was inspired by the nettle-like leaves. General common names include copperleaf and three-seeded mercury. Native North American species are generally inconspicuous most of the year until the fall when their stems and foliage turn a distinctive coppery-red.
The genus is distributed mainly in the tropics and subtropics, with about 60% of species native to the Americas and about 30% in Africa.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native habitat of temperate grasslands and open woodlands. It is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it prefers leaner soils.

### Fertilizer
Light to no fertilization. Prefers lean to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization can harm the plant, so use sparingly if at all.
