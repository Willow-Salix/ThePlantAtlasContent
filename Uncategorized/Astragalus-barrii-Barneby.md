## Care Guide
Barr's milkvetch is a drought-tolerant plant native to arid regions of western North America. It thrives in full sun and requires infrequent watering, with soil drying completely between applications. Fertilizer is generally not needed due to its ability to fix nitrogen and adaptation to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required; thrives in poor, well-drained soils. Nitrogen fixation helps nutrient acquisition.
