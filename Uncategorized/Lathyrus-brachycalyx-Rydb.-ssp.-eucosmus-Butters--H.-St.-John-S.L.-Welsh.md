## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Utah, Southern Idaho, Western Wyoming (USA) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Shrubland/Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, needing at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, consistent with its open grassland and woodland understory habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings. It is accustomed to well-drained soils and can tolerate some drought once established, but avoids consistently wet conditions. |

## Introduction
Lathyrus  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae, and contains approximately 160 species. Commonly known as peavines or vetchlings, they are native to temperate areas, with a breakdown of 52 species in Europe, 30 species in North America, 78 in Asia, 24 in tropical East Africa, and 24 in temperate South America. There are annual and perennial species which may be climbing or bushy.  This genus has numerous sections, including Orobus, which was once a separate genus. The genus has numerous synonyms, including Pisum, the ancient Latin name for the pea.

## Care Guide
This montane peavine thrives in sunny, well-drained locations with moderate watering, mimicking its native temperate shrubland and grassland environment. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires low to moderate fertilization. Ensure good air circulation and avoid waterlogged conditions for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, especially given its legume nature (nitrogen-fixing). A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in poor soils, but heavy feeding is generally not required.
