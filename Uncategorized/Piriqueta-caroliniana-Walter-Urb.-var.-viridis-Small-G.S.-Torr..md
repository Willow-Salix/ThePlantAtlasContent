## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its humid subtropical native habitat, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular watering is key, especially during dry spells. Fertilizer needs are moderate, with a balanced feed supporting growth during its active season.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied periodically during the growing season, particularly if the native soil is poor, but it generally thrives without heavy feeding.
