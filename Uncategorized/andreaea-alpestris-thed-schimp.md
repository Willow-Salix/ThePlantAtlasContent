## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | High-altitude montane and alpine regions across Europe, North America, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra or high Montane zones |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate some direct morning sun, especially in cooler environments, but should be protected from intense afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Water frequently, allowing only the very surface to dry slightly between waterings, mimicking snowmelt and rain. |

## 🌱 Overview
Andreaea is a genus of rock mosses described by Johann Hedwig in 1801.
They are small, delicate acrocarpous mosses (meaning that the capsules are formed at the tips of vertical branches) that form dark brown or reddish cushions on wet siliceous rocks in mountainous areas. The capsule lacks the peristome teeth and operculum of other mosses, and opens by splitting along 4 vertical slits, the four valves remaining joined at the base and apex. The capsule of Andreaea has no seta, but the sporophyte (Spf in the diagram below) instead is supported by a pseudopodium (ps) derived from gametophyte tissue, as in Sphagnum and the columella is enclosed within the sporangium. The spores germinate to give thalloid protonemata.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Andreaea alpestris thrives in cool, consistently moist, and well-drained conditions, mimicking its high-altitude rocky native habitat. Provide bright, indirect light and protect from intense afternoon sun. It has very low nutrient needs and requires excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low nutrient requirements. Fertilization is generally not needed; if used, apply a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly once or twice a year.
