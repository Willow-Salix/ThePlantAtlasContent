# Groutiella Moss

*Groutiella Steere* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America, and the Caribbean (Neotropics) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Humid Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to partial indirect light; avoid direct sunlight. Prefers filtered or dappled light conditions. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is crucial. Keep the substrate consistently moist but never waterlogged. Frequent misting is highly beneficial to maintain humidity. |

## Care Guide
Groutiella moss thrives in high humidity and low to partial indirect light, mimicking its native tropical forest understory habitat. Ensure the growing medium remains consistently moist but not waterlogged, and provide very little to no fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses require minimal nutrients; excessive fertilization can be harmful. If used, apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once or twice a year).
