### *Groutiella Steere*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and South America, and the Caribbean (Neotropics) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Humid Forest |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Groutiella moss thrives in high humidity and low to partial indirect light, mimicking its native tropical forest understory habitat. Ensure the growing medium remains consistently moist but not waterlogged, and provide very little to no fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses require minimal nutrients; excessive fertilization can be harmful. If used, apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once or twice a year).
