## Introduction
Portulaca ( POR-chə-LAK-ə, UK also  POR-tyuul-AK-ə, US also  POR-chə-LAH-kə) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Portulacaceae, and is the type genus of the family. With over 100 species, it is found in the tropics and warm temperate regions. Portulacas are also known as the purslanes.
Common purslane (Portulaca oleracea) is widely consumed as an edible plant, and in some areas it is invasive. Portulaca grandiflora is a well-known ornamental garden plant. Purslanes are relished by chickens. Some Portulaca species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the nutmeg moth (Hadula trifolii).
Some Portulaca species can undergo photosynthesis using the C4 or the CAM light-independent pathway as required depending on environmental conditions.
