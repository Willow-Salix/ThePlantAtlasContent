## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure; thrives in full direct sunlight, reflecting its natural habitat in open, exposed desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Low watering needs; highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Infrequent, deep watering is preferred over frequent, shallow applications, mimicking desert rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Machaeranthera is a genus of North American flowering plants in the family Asteraceae which are known by the common name tansyaster.
Tansyasters are variable in appearance. Some are small, singular wildflowers, while others are sprawling shrubs. Several species easily hybridize with each other, as well, making identification difficult. In general, members of the genus may be identified by the sharp-pointed, dagger-shaped anthers in the disc florets at the center of the flower. The flower heads are usually daisylike, and are usually a shade of purple or blue, but may be pink, yellow, or white. Tansyasters are native to western North America.
The genus Machaeranthera is distinguished from the genus Dieteria by having once- or twice-pinnate leaves, whereas Dieteria has entire to toothed leaves.
Machaeranthera means "swordlike anthers".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Golden Spiny Aster, a true desert survivor, demands abundant direct sunlight and infrequent watering, preferring its soil to dry out completely between sessions. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal to no fertilization, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or low-maintenance gardening.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements. Native desert soils are often nutrient-poor, so this plant is adapted to minimal nutrients. If desired, a very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year in spring.
