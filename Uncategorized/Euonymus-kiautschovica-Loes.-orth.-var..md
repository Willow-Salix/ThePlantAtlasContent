## Care Guide
The Spreading Euonymus is a versatile plant that prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil, though it tolerates some drought once mature. Fertilize lightly in spring for optimal growth. Its adaptability to varying conditions makes it relatively low-maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Native to regions with generally fertile forest soils, it benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer application in spring, especially to encourage robust growth.
