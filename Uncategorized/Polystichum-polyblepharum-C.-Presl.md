## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate Forest Understory |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch fronds. It thrives in dappled light conditions similar to a forest floor. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is key. Water regularly to keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged, allowing the top inch to dry slightly between waterings. High humidity is also beneficial. |

## Introduction
Polystichum is a genus of ferns in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). The genus has about 500 species and has a cosmopolitan distribution. The highest diversity is in eastern Asia, with about 208 species in China alone; the region from Mexico to Brazil has at least 100 additional species; Africa (at least 17 species), North America (at least 18 species), and Europe (at least 5 species) have much lower diversity. Polystichum species are terrestrial or rock-dwelling ferns of warm-temperate and montane-tropical regions (a few species grow in alpine regions). They are often found in disturbed habitats such as road cuts, talus slopes, and stream banks.

## Care Guide
The Korean Tasselfern thrives in conditions that mimic its native East Asian forest floor, requiring consistent moisture, high humidity, and protection from direct sunlight. Provide dappled to full shade and keep the soil evenly moist, offering moderate fertilization during active growth to support its lush foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a diluted liquid fertilizer (half strength) every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
