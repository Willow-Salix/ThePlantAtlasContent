## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Valley and coastal ranges of California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Seasonally Wet Grasslands/Vernal Pools) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure (6+ hours direct sun daily), as it grows in open, unshaded areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently wet to submerged conditions during its active growing season (late winter to spring), followed by a dry period where the soil completely dries out during summer dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eryngium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. There are about 250 species. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, with centres of diversity in the western Mediterranean, South America and Mexico. Common names include eryngo and sea holly (though not to be confused with true hollies, of the genus Ilex).
These are annual and perennial herbs with hairless and usually spiny leaves. The dome-shaped umbels of steely blue or white flowers have whorls of spiny basal bracts. European and Asian species tend to be native to dry, rocky and coastal areas, and the American species are native to often damp grasslands.
In the language of flowers, they represent admiration.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and necessitates a strict wet-dry cycle, mirroring its native vernal pool environment. Ensure abundant water during its growth phase in late winter to spring, transitioning to a completely dry dormancy throughout summer. Plant in heavy, well-draining soil that can retain moisture seasonally but also dry out completely.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in early spring if soil is particularly poor, but generally, it is not a heavy feeder.
