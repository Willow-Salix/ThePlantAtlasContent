| **Native Origin** | Central and Southern California, USA |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Meadow (within a Mediterranean climate zone) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open grassland native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist soil; regular and consistent watering is crucial, especially during dry periods and active growth, mirroring its native presence in moist areas and near streams. |

## Introduction
Helenium is a genus of annuals and herbaceous perennial plants in the family Asteraceae, native to the Americas.
They bear yellow or orange daisy-like composite flowers. A number of these species (particularly Helenium autumnale) have the common name sneezeweed, based on the former use of their dried leaves in making snuff. It was inhaled to cause sneezing that would supposedly rid the body of evil spirits. Larger species may grow up to 2 metres (6.6 ft) tall.
The genus is named for Helen of Troy, daughter of Zeus and Leda.
Helenium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Phymatopus behrensii.
Genus level properties: most conspicuously globe-like disk-shaped flowers, rays three-lobed at tip.

## Care Guide
Woolly Sneezeweed thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist soil, especially during its growing season, to emulate its native habitat in California's moist grasslands. Provide regular watering and ensure moderate soil fertility for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility; benefits from a light application of balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring if the soil is poor, typical for grassland species.
