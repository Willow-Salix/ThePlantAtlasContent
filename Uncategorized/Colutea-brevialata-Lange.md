## 🌱 Overview
Colutea is a genus of about 28 species of deciduous flowering shrubs in the legume family, Fabaceae, growing from 2–5 metres (6+1⁄2–16+1⁄2 ft) tall and native to the Old World. They are sometimes called bladder sennas, although they are not particularly closely related to the true sennas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Mediterranean native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, exhibiting excellent drought tolerance once established. Provide moderate watering during the active growth period, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, and reduce significantly in winter, with minimal need for fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly in spring with a balanced, slow-release formula, or avoid if the soil is reasonably fertile.
