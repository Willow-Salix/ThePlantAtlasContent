## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Endemic to Wawawai Canyon, Snake River, southeastern Washington State, USA |
| **Climate** | Temperate Shrub-Steppe/Open Woodland, semi-arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers some afternoon shade in hotter climates or regions to prevent scorching. |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent watering, especially during spring and early summer growth and bloom; tolerant of some dry spells once established but prefers well-drained, consistently moist soil. |

## Introduction
Aquilegia, commonly known as columbines, is a genus of perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae (buttercups). The genus includes between 80 and 400 taxa (described species and subspecies) with natural ranges across the Northern Hemisphere. Natural and introduced populations of Aquilegia exist on all continents but Antarctica. Known for their high physical variability and ease of hybridization, columbines are popular garden plants and have been used to create many cultivated varieties.
Aquilegia typically possess stiff stems and leaves that divide into multiple leaflets. Columbines often have colorful flowers with five sepals and five petals. The petals generally feature nectar spurs which differ in lengths between species. In North America, morphological variations in spurs evolved to suit different pollinators. Some species and varieties of columbines are naturally spurless. In cultivation, varieties bearing significantly altered physical traits such as double flowering are prevalent.
Associated with fertility goddesses in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, archeological evidence suggests Aquilegia were in cultivation by the 2nd century AD in Roman Britain. Despite often being toxic, columbines have been used by humans as herbal remedies, perfume, and food. Asian traditional medicine, Indigenous North Americans, and Medieval Europeans have considered portions of the plants to have medicinal uses. Selective breeding and hybridization of columbines has occurred for centuries, with exchanges between Old and New World species creating further diversity.

## Care Guide
The Wawawai Canyon Columbine thrives in full sun to partial shade, favoring well-drained soil that mimics its native rocky slopes. It requires moderate, consistent moisture during its active growing season but can tolerate short dry periods once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it prefers lean to moderately rich soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; these plants are adapted to lean soils. Over-fertilizing can be detrimental. A light application of compost can be beneficial.
