## Introduction
Carduus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, and the tribe Cardueae, one of two genera considered to be true thistles, the other being Cirsium. Plants of the genus are known commonly as plumeless thistles. They are native to temperate Eurasia and North Africa, and several are known elsewhere as introduced species. This genus is noted for its disproportionately high number of noxious weeds compared to other flowering plant genera.

## Care Guide
This thistle thrives in full sun to partial sun conditions with moderate watering, adapting well to the fluctuating moisture of its native humid subtropical environment. It is not demanding regarding soil fertility, making it a low-maintenance plant once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring if soil is very poor.
