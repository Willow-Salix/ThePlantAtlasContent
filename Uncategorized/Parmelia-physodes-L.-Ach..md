## Care Guide
The Inflated Tube Lichen thrives in cool, humid conditions with partial to filtered light, typical of temperate and boreal forests. Ensure constant moisture through high ambient humidity and regular misting, as it cannot tolerate prolonged dryness. Fertilizers are detrimental, as it acquires nutrients from the air and its substrate.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed; standard plant fertilizers are harmful as lichens absorb nutrients directly from air and water.
