## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in full sun, Moss Verbena requires moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry out between sessions, especially once established due to its native drought tolerance. Fertilize sparingly to support its growth. This hardy plant is well-suited for open, sunny locations.
