## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Africa, Asia, and Australia, widely naturalized in tropical and subtropical regions globally. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Aquatic |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. As a surface-dwelling aquatic plant, it thrives with ample light exposure, similar to open water bodies in its native range. |
| **💧 Water** | This is an aquatic plant that lives entirely in water. It requires a stable, still or slow-moving body of fresh water, ensuring continuous submersion or floating on the surface. |

## 🌱 Overview
Spirodela punctata (or Landoltia punctata, common name dotted duckmeat) is a species of duckweed (Lemnoideae).  The species is morphologically intermediate between Lemna and other species of Spirodela.  In 1999 D.H. Les and D.J. Crawford proposed segregating the species to a new genus Landoltia containing just the species L. punctata, on the basis of biochemical and DNA studies.
S. punctata originally was found in Australia and South Asia, but today it can also be found in the Southern and Eastern United States.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Duckmeat requires a consistently aquatic environment, thriving in full sun to partial shade on the surface of still or slow-moving water. Ensure the water is moderately rich in nutrients to support its rapid growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Nutrients are absorbed directly from the water column. It thrives in moderately to richly nutrient-dense water, characteristic of natural ponds and ditches.
