## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright, direct sunlight and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native subalpine conditions. It is adapted to lean soils and requires minimal fertilization. Ensure good air circulation and avoid waterlogged conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy alpine soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
