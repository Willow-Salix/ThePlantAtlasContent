## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains, Great Plains, parts of California and the Pacific Northwest), including regions of the United States and Canada. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine Meadow and Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, as it naturally grows in open meadows and clearings. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings. It tolerates dry spells but thrives with consistent moisture in well-drained soil, mimicking its native habitat's varied rainfall. |

## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
Provide full sun to partial sun exposure and moderate watering, ensuring well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate montane meadows, requiring minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to typical grassland and meadow soils which are not excessively rich. An annual light feeding or compost application is sufficient.
