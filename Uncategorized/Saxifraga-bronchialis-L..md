## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including North America (Alaska, Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains), Northeast Asia (Siberia, Japan, Korea), and parts of Europe (e.g., Arctic Ural Mountains). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine Montane regions. |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Shade. Thrives in exposed, bright locations, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Requires excellent drainage, mimicking its rocky native habitat where water drains quickly. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
Yellowdot Saxifrage thrives in conditions mimicking its alpine home: plenty of sun, excellent drainage, and lean soil. Water moderately, ensuring the roots never sit in standing water, and avoid heavy fertilization to maintain its robust, hardy nature.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. These plants are adapted to lean, rocky soils; excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
