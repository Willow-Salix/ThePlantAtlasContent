## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Tepic Flameflower thrives in bright, full sun conditions and well-draining soil, mimicking its arid native habitat. Allow the soil to dry completely between waterings to prevent root rot, as it is highly drought tolerant. Fertilizer needs are minimal.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Fertilize sparingly, once or twice during the active growing season with a diluted, balanced fertilizer.
