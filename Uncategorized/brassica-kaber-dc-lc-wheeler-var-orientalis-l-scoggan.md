## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Europe, North Africa, Western and Central Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Agricultural Lands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (requires direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day due to its native open field environment). |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. It is tolerant of short dry spells once established, reflecting the variable rainfall of temperate regions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Brassicaceae () or (the older but equally valid) Cruciferae () is a medium-sized and economically important family of flowering plants commonly known as the mustards, the crucifers, or the cabbage family. Most are herbaceous plants, while some are shrubs. The leaves are simple (although are sometimes deeply incised), lack stipules, and appear alternately on stems or in rosettes. The inflorescences are terminal and lack bracts. The flowers have four free sepals, four free alternating petals, two shorter free stamens and four longer free stamens. The fruit has seeds in rows, divided by a thin wall (or septum). As of 2023, the family was divided into two subfamilies, Brassicoideae and Aethionemoideae, and as of September 2025, it contained over 350 accepted genera.
Pieris rapae and other butterflies of the family Pieridae are some of the best-known pests of Brassicaceae species planted as commercial crops. Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper) moth is also becoming increasingly problematic for crucifers due to its resistance to commonly used pest control methods. Some rarer Pieris butterflies, such as P. virginiensis, depend upon native mustards for their survival in their native habitats. Some non-native mustards such as Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard), an extremely invasive species in the United States, can be toxic to their larvae.
The family contains the cruciferous vegetables, including species such as Brassica oleracea (cultivated as cabbage, kale, cauliflower, broccoli and collards), Brassica rapa (turnip, Chinese cabbage, etc.), Brassica napus (rapeseed, etc.), Raphanus sativus (common radish), Armoracia rusticana (horseradish), the cut-flower Matthiola (stock) and the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wild Mustard is a hardy plant that flourishes in full sun and open environments. It requires moderate watering, tolerating some drought once established, and has low fertilizer needs, adapting well to average soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in average to poor soil conditions typical of disturbed agricultural lands and requires minimal supplemental feeding.
