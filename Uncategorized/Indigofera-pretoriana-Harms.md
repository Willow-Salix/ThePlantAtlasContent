| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun exposure, mimicking its open grassland and woodland habitats. |

## Care Guide
Pretoria Indigo thrives in full sun with well-draining soil, mimicking its native savanna environment. It requires consistent watering during its summer growth period, followed by a dry winter dormancy. Fertilize sparingly, as this legume benefits from nitrogen fixation.

### Fertilizer
As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has moderate to low fertilizer needs. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season, or a slow-release organic amendment.
