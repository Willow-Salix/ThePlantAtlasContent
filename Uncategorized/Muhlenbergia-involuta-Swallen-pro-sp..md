## Introduction
Muhlenbergia is a genus of plants in the grass family.
The genus is named in honor of the German-American amateur botanist Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg (1753-1815). Many of the species are known by the common name muhly.
The greatest number are native to the southwestern United States and Mexico, but there are also native species in Canada, Central and South America and in Asia.

## Care Guide
This muhly grass thrives in conditions mimicking its native montane savannas, requiring ample sunlight and well-drained soil. Water moderately during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and fertilize sparingly. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot, especially during cooler or dormant periods.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring, or minimal liquid feeding during the growing season in poorer soils.
