## 🌱 Overview
Pohlia is a genus of mosses in the family Mniaceae, found on all continents including Antarctica. Some of its species are native to multiple continents. The center of diversity is the Northern Hemisphere.
The genus name of Pohlia is in honour of Johann Ehrenfried Pohl (1746–1800), who was a German physician and botanist. 
The genus was circumscribed by Johann Hedwig in Descriptio et Adumbratio microscopio-analytica Muscorum

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pohlia Carnea thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded conditions, mimicking its native habitat on damp ground. Maintain a constantly damp, well-draining substrate and protect it from direct sun. Fertilization is typically unnecessary as mosses have low nutrient demands.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; mosses generally require minimal nutrients. Fertilization is rarely needed, or use a very dilute solution if growth is visibly poor.
