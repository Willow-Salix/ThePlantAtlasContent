| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland (Sonoran Desert) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) to thrive. It tolerates intense desert sun. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly in cooler months. |

## Introduction
Yucca ( YUCK-uh) is both the scientific name and common name for a genus native to North America from Panama to southern Canada. It contains 50 accepted species. In addition to yucca, they are also known as Adam's needle or Spanish-bayonet. The genus is generally classified in the asparagus family in a subfamily with the Agave, though historically it was part of the lily family. The species range from small shrubby plants to tree-like giants, such as the Joshua tree. All yuccas have rosettes of leaves that taper to points and inflorescences with many flowers that are mainly cream white with thick petals. Though adapted to a wide range of climates the plants are xerophytes, ones that specialize in dry living conditions.
The tight relationship between the yucca plants and their pollinators, the yucca moths from the genera Tegeticula and Parategeticula, is a well known example of evolutionary mutualism. They are an important part of the ecology of North American deserts, providing shelter to small animals and creating habitats. The human uses of yuccas include garden plants, as food, and for extracts. The flower petals of various species are eaten as a part of local cuisine, particularly in Central America and Mexico. Historically, the yucca was extensively used for its fibers to make cords, baskets, mats, and sandals. It continues to be used by native peoples for traditional soaps.

## Care Guide
The Arizona Yucca thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its arid native environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings to prevent root rot, and fertilizer needs are minimal. This resilient plant is well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-prone gardens.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. A light, balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in spring is sufficient, or it may not need any if planted in well-amended soil.
