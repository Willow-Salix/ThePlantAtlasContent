# Sticky Dudleya

*Stylophyllum viscidum (S. Watson) Britton & Rose* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern California, USA and Northern Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright direct light, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **Watering** | Water deeply but infrequently during its active growth period (fall to spring), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Keep almost entirely dry during its summer dormancy to prevent rot. |

## Care Guide
This succulent thrives in full sun, mimicking its native Mediterranean scrubland habitat. Water deeply but infrequently during its active growth from fall to spring, allowing the soil to dry out completely, and keep very dry during its summer dormancy. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; apply a diluted, balanced succulent fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (fall to spring) if growth seems slow, otherwise not strictly necessary.
