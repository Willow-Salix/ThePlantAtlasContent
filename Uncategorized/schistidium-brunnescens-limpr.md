## 🧤 Care Instructions
Schistidium brunnescens thrives in cool, bright, and consistently moist conditions, mimicking its native alpine and arctic rock habitats. Ensure excellent drainage and provide bright indirect light or partial sun to prevent desiccation. Fertilization is generally not needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not required; mosses obtain sufficient nutrients from water and the substrate. High fertility can be detrimental. If absolutely necessary, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly.
