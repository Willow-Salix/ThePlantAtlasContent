## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia, Alabama) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (wet meadows, flatwoods, pond margins) |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure, typical of open meadow habitats where it receives direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Demands consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native habitat in ditches, pond margins, and wet prairies. It is not tolerant of drought. |

## Introduction
Aeschynomene is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae, and was recently assigned to the informal monophyletic Dalbergia clade of the Dalbergieae. They are known commonly as jointvetches. They range across tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, south, southeast, and east Asia, and Australia. These legumes are most common in warm regions and many species are aquatic.
The genus as currently circumscribed is paraphyletic and it has been suggested that the subgenus Ochopodium be elevated to a new genus within the Dalbergieae, though other changes will also be required to render the genus monophyletic. Plants of the World Online currently accepts 114 species.

## Care Guide
Meadow Jointvetch thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet to moist soil conditions, mimicking its native subtropical wetland habitat. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it benefits from moderate, low-nitrogen fertilization.

### Fertilizer
As a legume, it fixes nitrogen in the soil, so moderate fertilization with a balanced, lower-nitrogen formula is sufficient. Excessive nitrogen should be avoided.
