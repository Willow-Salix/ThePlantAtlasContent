## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, and Montana. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coniferous Forest / Temperate Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial to full shade; thrives in dappled light or indirect exposure, and must be protected from direct afternoon sun which can scorch fronds. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Water regularly to keep the soil evenly damp, especially during dry periods, but avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Polystichum is a genus of ferns in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). The genus has about 500 species and has a cosmopolitan distribution. The highest diversity is in eastern Asia, with about 208 species in China alone; the region from Mexico to Brazil has at least 100 additional species; Africa (at least 17 species), North America (at least 18 species), and Europe (at least 5 species) have much lower diversity. Polystichum species are terrestrial or rock-dwelling ferns of warm-temperate and montane-tropical regions (a few species grow in alpine regions). They are often found in disturbed habitats such as road cuts, talus slopes, and stream banks.

## Care Guide
The Western Sword Fern thrives in cool, moist, and shady conditions, mimicking its native temperate forest floor habitat. Ensure consistently moist, well-draining soil and protect it from any direct afternoon sun exposure. Fertilize lightly with organic matter once a year for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder. Benefits from an annual application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or a top-dressing of organic compost in spring. Avoid heavy fertilization.
