## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Puerto Rico |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial direct sun, as it typically grows in the canopy of host trees. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture and high humidity are essential, mirroring tropical rainfall patterns; water needs are largely met through its host plant. |

## Introduction
Dendropemon is a genus of mistletoes which is endemic to the Caribbean. Members of the genus are hemi-parasites which normally grow on trees and shrubs, although self-parasitism is known to occur. The approximately 31 species range from The Bahamas and Cuba in the north and west, to Barbados and St. Vincent in the southwest. Diversity and endemism is highest on the island of Hispaniola.
The name Dendropemon coined by botanist Carl Ludwig Blume in 1830. He recognised it as a section within the genus Loranthus, rather than a distinct genus. Although no derivation was given for the name of the genus, it is believed to come from the Greek dendron (δένδρν), tree, and pemon (πήμων), harmful.

## Care Guide
As a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical wet forests of Puerto Rico, this species requires bright indirect to partial sun and high humidity. Its primary care involves ensuring a suitable host tree can thrive in consistently moist conditions, as the leechbush draws water and nutrients directly from it.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; nutrients are primarily absorbed from the host plant. If attempting cultivation with a host, a diluted, balanced fertilizer for the host might be considered.
