## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South-central United States (primarily Texas and Oklahoma) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; tolerates full sun in moist conditions but benefits from some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist, especially during the growing season; prefers moist to wet, well-drained conditions, mimicking its native habitat in damp prairies and open woodlands. |

## Introduction
Ranunculus  is a large genus of about 1750 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Members of the genus are known as buttercups, spearworts and water crowfoots.
The genus is distributed worldwide, primarily in temperate and montane regions. The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, which has extremely tough and tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much taller meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris. In ornamental  gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.
Buttercups usually flower in the spring, but flowers may be found throughout the summer, especially where the plants are growing as opportunistic colonizers, as in the case of garden weeds.
The water crowfoots (Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium), which grow in still or running water, are sometimes treated in a separate genus Batrachium (from Greek βάτραχος bátrakhos, "frog"). They have two different leaf types, thread-like leaves underwater and broader floating leaves. In some species, such as R. aquatilis, a third, intermediate leaf type occurs.
Ranunculus species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Hebrew character and small angle shades. Some species are popular ornamental flowers in horticulture, with many cultivars selected for large and brightly coloured flowers.

## Care Guide
Lindheimer's Buttercup thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil to mimic its native grassland and woodland habitats in Texas and Oklahoma. Ensure regular watering during its active growth period and provide minimal fertilization for robust health and abundant spring blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, using a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer sparingly if soil is poor; generally not a heavy feeder in rich, native soils.
