## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Japan (specifically Honshu and Kyushu) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full sun; full sun encourages more vibrant striping in its leaves. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist but well-drained soil, especially during dry periods, mimicking the ample rainfall of its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Arundinaria is a genus of bamboo in the grass family, the members of which are referred to generally as cane. Arundinaria is the only bamboo native to North America, with a native range from Maryland south to Florida and west to the southern Ohio Valley and Texas.
Within this region Arundinaria cane is found from the Coastal Plain to medium elevations in the Appalachian Mountains.
Prior to the European colonization of the Americas, cane was an important resource for Indigenous peoples of the Americas. Early European explorers in the U.S. described vast monotypic stands of Arundinaria that were common in river lowlands and covered hundreds of thousands of hectares. In the modern era, Arundinaria canebrakes are small and isolated, but there has been interest in restoring them due to the cultural and ecological importance of the plant. Canebrakes provided land for crops, habitat for wild game, and year-round forage for livestock. The cane itself was used for construction, weapons, jewelry, medicines, fuel, and food. Canebrakes declined significantly after colonization due to clearing, farming and fire suppression.

## Care Guide
This bamboo thrives in conditions ranging from partial shade to full sun, with more sun enhancing its unique leaf striping. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from regular fertilization during its active growing period to maintain its health and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to heavy feeding during the growing season with a balanced, high-nitrogen fertilizer to support its vigorous growth in nutrient-rich forest soils.
