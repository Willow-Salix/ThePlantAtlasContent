## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern North America (specifically, riparian areas of Vermont, USA) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Riparian/Wetland (cool, humid, consistently wet environments near water bodies) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to indirect light; requires protection from direct, harsh sunlight which can cause dehydration. |
| **Watering** | Requires constantly moist to wet conditions, mimicking its native stream-side habitat. High ambient humidity is crucial, and the substrate should never be allowed to dry out. |

## Care Guide
This moss variety thrives in cool, humid, and consistently wet environments, replicating its natural riparian habitat. Provide partial shade or indirect light, ensuring the substrate remains continuously moist and that high humidity levels are maintained. Fertilization is generally not required, as mosses have very low nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer; mosses are sensitive to high nutrient levels. Minimal nutrients absorbed from water and substrate are typically sufficient for healthy growth.
