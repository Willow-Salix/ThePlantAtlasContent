## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Rough Sedge thrives in temperate conditions, adapting to a range of sun exposures from full sun to partial shade. It prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil but is tolerant of some dryness. Minimal fertilization is typically required, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, especially if soil nutrients are poor.
