## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern Europe, extending into Western Asia (e.g., Balkan Peninsula, Ukraine, Russia, Turkey). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Steppe; often found in dry meadows, forest margins, and open, grassy areas. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun in cooler climates but can benefit from some afternoon shade in hotter regions. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established due to its native dry grassland habitats. |

## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
Ashy cinquefoil thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil, reflecting its native temperate grasslands and steppes. It prefers moderate watering, becoming drought-tolerant once established, and generally requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Typically thrives in lean to average soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if the soil is poor, otherwise, it may not be necessary.
