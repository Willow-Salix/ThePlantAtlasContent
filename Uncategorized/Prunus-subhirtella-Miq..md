## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Japan (specifically, mountainous regions) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Optimal flowering occurs with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture, especially when young. Requires regular watering to keep soil moist but not waterlogged. Established trees have moderate drought tolerance but benefit from supplemental water during dry periods. Ensure excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Prunus is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs from the family Rosaceae. The genus includes plums, cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots and almonds (collectively stonefruit). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, being native to the temperate regions of North America, the neotropics of South America, and temperate and tropical regions of Eurasia and Africa, There are about 340 accepted species as of March 2024.
Many members of the genus are widely cultivated for their sweet, fleshy fruit and for decorative purposes of their flowers. Prunus fruit are drupes, or stone fruits. The fleshy mesocarp surrounding the endocarp is edible while the endocarp itself forms a hard, inedible shell called the pyrena ("stone" or "pit"). This shell encloses the seed (or "kernel"), which is edible in some species (such as sweet almonds), but poisonous in many others (such as apricot kernels). Besides being eaten off the hand, most Prunus fruit  are also commonly used in processing, such as jam production, canning, drying, and the seeds for roasting.

## Care Guide
This temperate cherry tree thrives in full sun with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native Japanese mountainous habitat. It requires regular watering, particularly when young, and generally low to moderate fertilization once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. For young trees or in poor soils, apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring. Established trees in healthy soil may not require annual fertilization. Incorporating organic matter is beneficial.
