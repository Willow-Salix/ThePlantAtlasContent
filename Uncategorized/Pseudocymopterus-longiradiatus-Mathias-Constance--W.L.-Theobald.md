| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Trans-Pecos region of West Texas, USA, extending into adjacent New Mexico and northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid to semi-arid montane scrubland, found on rocky slopes and canyons at higher elevations |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright direct light; requires high light exposure mirroring its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate watering; highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking infrequent but deep rainfall events. |

## Care Guide
Trans-Pecos False Mountainparsley thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, reflecting its arid montane origins. Water infrequently, allowing thorough drying between sessions, and provide minimal fertilization. This plant is well-suited for xeriscaping or rock gardens in similar climates.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; adapted to lean, rocky soils. An annual light feeding or incorporation into a naturally rich soil mix is usually sufficient.
