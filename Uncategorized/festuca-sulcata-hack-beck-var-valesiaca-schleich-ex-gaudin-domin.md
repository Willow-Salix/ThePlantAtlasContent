## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Eastern Europe, extending to Siberia and Central Asia, particularly in dry grasslands and mountainous regions. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Continental Steppe and Dry Alpine/Sub-Alpine Slopes |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive. |
| **💧 Water** | Highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fescue thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, preferring infrequent watering and well-drained soil. It requires minimal fertilization, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor steppe and dry slope environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, typically once in spring with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer, especially if growth appears weak in very poor soils.
