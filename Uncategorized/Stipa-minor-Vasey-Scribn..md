## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (primarily the mountainous and arid regions of the USA, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Montane Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low; highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering once established. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, typical of dry grassland species. |

## Introduction
Stipa is a genus of about 140 species of large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and  spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to Stipa, which have since been reclassified into new genera.
Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as Stipa brachytricha, S. arundinacea, S. splendens, S. gigantea and S. pulchra are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.
It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.

## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives on neglect, requiring full sun and very little water once established due to its native arid environment. It prefers well-draining soil and typically does not need regular fertilization, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary, or a light application of a slow-release granular fertilizer in spring if growth appears weak.
