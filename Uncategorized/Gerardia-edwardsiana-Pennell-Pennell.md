## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils typical of its native southeastern US pine barrens. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and avoid rich fertilization given its hemiparasitic nature and adaptation to poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; it thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils due to its hemiparasitic nature.
