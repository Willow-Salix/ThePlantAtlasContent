## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, including Europe (e.g., UK, Ireland, France, Germany) and North America (e.g., USA, Canada). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate forests and woodlands, characterized by high ambient humidity and regular precipitation. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to dappled light; it should be sheltered from direct, intense sunlight which can lead to desiccation, thriving on tree bark beneath a canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and moisture absorbed directly from atmospheric precipitation (rain, dew). It does not have roots and cannot be watered in the conventional sense; prolonged dry periods are detrimental. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arthopyrenia is a genus of fungi in the family Trypetheliaceae. It was formerly classified in the eponymic family Arthopyreniaceae, but molecular phylogenetics studies showed that the type species, Arthopyrenia cerasi, was a member of the Trypetheliaceae. Arthopyrenia fungi typically form inconspicuous films embedded within tree bark and produce tiny, flask-shaped fruiting bodies covered by dark, shield-like caps. The genus includes both lichen-forming species (those that partner with algae) and non-lichenized species, with about 100 currently recognized species found primarily on bark and wood substrates.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This is a corticolous lichen found in humid, temperate forests, making conventional plant care irrelevant. It thrives in partial shade with high atmospheric moisture and is highly sensitive to air quality, obtaining nutrients from the environment rather than soil or fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizer. Lichens obtain nutrients from atmospheric deposition and substances on the bark surface, and are highly sensitive to air pollution.
