## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Italy (including Sardinia and Corsica) |

| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. As a pioneer species and a tree, it thrives with ample light exposure. |
| **Watering** | High; requires consistently moist soil, especially during establishment and dry periods, reflecting its native habitat along stream banks and moist valleys within a Mediterranean climate. Tolerates occasional waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Alnus cordata, the Italian alder, is a tree or shrub species belonging to the family Betulaceae, and native to the southern Apennine Mountains (Campania, Basilicata and Calabria, mainly on western mountain sides) and the north-eastern mountains of Corsica. It has been introduced in Sicily, Sardinia, and more recently in Central-Northern Italy, other European countries (France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, United Kingdom) and extra-European countries (Chile, New Zealand), where it has become naturalised.

## Care Guide
The Italian alder is a robust tree that prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist conditions, drawing from its riparian native habitat. It is low-maintenance regarding nutrients due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it adaptable to various soil types once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Alnus species are nitrogen-fixers, enriching the soil they grow in. Supplemental fertilization is rarely needed unless in extremely poor soil.
