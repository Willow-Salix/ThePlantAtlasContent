## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Quebec sedge thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, mimicking its native wetland habitats in Quebec and New England. It prefers full sun to partial shade exposure and benefits from organic-rich soil, requiring only light fertilization. Ensure the soil never dries out to promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate; an annual application of a balanced fertilizer is sufficient, especially if grown in organic-rich soil.
