## 🧤 Care Instructions
Quebec sedge thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, mimicking its native wetland habitats in Quebec and New England. It prefers full sun to partial shade exposure and benefits from organic-rich soil, requiring only light fertilization. Ensure the soil never dries out to promote healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate; an annual application of a balanced fertilizer is sufficient, especially if grown in organic-rich soil.
