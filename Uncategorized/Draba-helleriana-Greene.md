| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the mountainous regions of the United States (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada) and parts of Canada. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. Requires high light exposure mimicking its natural high-altitude environment with minimal tree cover. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, ensuring excellent drainage. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. Avoid waterlogging as it grows in well-drained, rocky soils. |

## Care Guide
Heller's Draba, a high-altitude plant, thrives in full sun with excellent drainage. Water moderately, letting the soil dry slightly between applications, and apply fertilizer sparingly to mimic its nutrient-poor native environment.

### Fertilizer
Low. A very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer application in spring, or none at all, is typically sufficient for its needs in nutrient-poor alpine soils.
