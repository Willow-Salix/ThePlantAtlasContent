## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically montane and subalpine regions of the western United States (e.g., California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. In its native open woods, meadows, and rocky slopes, it receives significant direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Requires consistent moisture, especially during active growth, but excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot, reflecting its rocky, well-drained native soils. Tolerates short dry spells. |

## Care Guide
Simple Campion prefers full to partial sun and moderate, consistent watering with excellent drainage, replicating its native montane and subalpine habitats. It thrives with low to moderate fertilization, supporting its robust growth in lean to moderately fertile soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer. Its native montane soils are typically not excessively rich. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring should suffice.
