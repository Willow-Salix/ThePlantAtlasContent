## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically California, Oregon, and Washington in the United States) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland and Meadow, often in moist, riparian zones or streambanks |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers partial shade in hotter climates or during the hottest part of the day to maintain moisture. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil; requires moderate to high watering frequency, particularly in full sun or during dry periods. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## Care Guide
Canyon Clover thrives in consistently moist soil and can tolerate full sun to partial shade, preferring some protection from intense afternoon sun. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires minimal fertilization, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so supplemental nitrogen is rarely needed. A general balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly if soil nutrients are known to be poor.
