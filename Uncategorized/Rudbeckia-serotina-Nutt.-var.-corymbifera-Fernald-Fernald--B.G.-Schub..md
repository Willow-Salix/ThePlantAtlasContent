## Care Guide
This North American native thrives in full sun conditions, replicating its natural prairie habitat. It prefers moderate watering in well-draining soil but demonstrates good drought tolerance once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it adapts well to lean to moderately fertile soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally does not require heavy fertilization. An annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, especially in poorer soils.
