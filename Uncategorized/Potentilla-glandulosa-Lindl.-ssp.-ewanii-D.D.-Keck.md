## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern California (Transverse and Peninsular Ranges, USA) and northern Baja California (Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland and Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Shade. In its native habitat, it grows in open, exposed areas, but also under light tree cover in montane forests. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Adapted to dry summers and wet winters, indicating good drought tolerance once established. |

## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
Ewan's cinquefoil thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean and montane habitats. It requires moderate watering during its growing season but is drought-tolerant once established, benefiting from minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Native soils in these regions are often lean; over-fertilization can be detrimental. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring, if needed, would suffice.
