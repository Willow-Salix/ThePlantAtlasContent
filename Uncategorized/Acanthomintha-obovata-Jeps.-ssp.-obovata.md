## Introduction
Acanthomintha is a genus of the mint family, Lamiaceae. The genus Acanthomintha is commonly referred to as thornmint or thorn-mint. There are four species within this genus, including the endangered species Acanthomintha duttonii. All four thornmints are native to the California Floristic Province. The origin of the genus name is from the identical Greek word meaning thornmint.

## Care Guide
San Benito Thorn-mint thrives in full sun and well-draining, infertile soils, mimicking its native serpentine barrens in California's Mediterranean climate. This drought-tolerant plant requires minimal watering once established and generally no fertilization to flourish, making it suitable for low-maintenance, native plant gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; it thrives in nutrient-poor serpentine soils and does not require rich amendments.
