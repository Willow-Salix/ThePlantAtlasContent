## Introduction
Abutilon  is a large genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia. General common names include Indian mallow and velvetleaf; ornamental varieties may be known as room maple, parlor maple, or flowering maple.
The genus name is an 18th-century Neo-Latin word that came from the Arabic ’abū-ṭīlūn (أبو طيلون),  the name given by Avicenna to this or a similar genus.
The type species is Abutilon theophrasti. Several species formerly placed in Abutilon, including the cultivated species and hybrids commonly known as "flowering maples", have recently (2012, 2014) been transferred to the new genus Callianthe.

## Care Guide
This warm-climate plant thrives in ample sunlight and well-draining soil. Provide regular water during its active growth, letting the soil dry out between sessions, and apply a moderate fertilizer. Reduce watering in cooler months to mimic its native seasonal dry periods.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season.
