## Introduction
Hedyotis (starviolet) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. Many species of this genus such as Hedyotis biflora, H. corymbosa and H. diffusa are well known medicinal plants. Hedyotis is native to tropical and subtropical Asia and to islands of the northwest Pacific. It comprises about 115 species. The type species for the genus is Hedyotis fruticosa.
Hedyotis was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in Species Plantarum. This generic name is derived from two Greek words, hedys, "sweet", and otos, "ear", in reference to the sweet-scented, ear-shaped leaves of some species.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical wet forest home, requiring consistent moisture and high humidity, along with bright indirect light. Avoid direct scorching sun and ensure well-draining soil to prevent root issues while providing moderate feeding during growth periods.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer. Tropical forest soils can be nutrient-rich but also have rapid nutrient cycling.
