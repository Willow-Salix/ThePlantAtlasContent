## Introduction
Linum (flax) is a genus of approximately 200 species in the flowering plant family Linaceae. They are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the world. The genus includes the common flax (L. usitatissimum), the bast fibre of which is used to produce linen and the seeds to produce linseed oil.

The flowers of most species are blue or yellow, rarely red, white, or pink, and some are heterostylous. There is an average of 6 to 10 seeds per boll.
Linum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the cabbage moth, the nutmeg, the setaceous Hebrew character and Coleophora striolatella, which feeds exclusively on Linum narbonense.

## Care Guide
Sprucemont flax thrives in full sun exposures and is highly adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It requires very little water and is extremely drought-tolerant, preferring well-draining, poor to moderately fertile soils. Fertilization is generally not needed and can be harmful.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
