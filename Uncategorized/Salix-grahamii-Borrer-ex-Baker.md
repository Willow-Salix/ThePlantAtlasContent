## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Scotland and northern Europe, particularly where parent species (Salix herbacea and Salix myrsinifolia) overlap. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate to Subalpine Moist Heath and Montane Stream Banks |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, thriving in open, exposed locations. |
| **Watering** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its natural habitat near streams or in damp heathlands. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
Graham's willow thrives in consistently moist to wet soil under full to partial sun, reflecting its cool temperate to subalpine native habitats. Ensure excellent drainage while maintaining high soil moisture, typical of its northern European origins. Moderate fertilization is generally sufficient for healthy growth, avoiding excessive feeding.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly, especially in poorer soils.
