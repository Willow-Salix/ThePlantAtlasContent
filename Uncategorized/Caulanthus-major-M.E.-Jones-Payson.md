## Introduction
Caulanthus is a genus of plants in the family Brassicaceae. Plants of this genus may be known as jewelflowers. They are also often referred to as wild cabbage, although this common name usually refers to wild variants of Brassica oleracea, the cabbage plant. Jewelflowers are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they are often found in warm, arid regions. Many species have an enlarged, erect stem rising from a basal rosette of leaves. Flowers arise directly from the surface of the stem; many species have colorful, bell-shaped flowers. The best-known of the fourteen species is probably the desert candle.

## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun, the Slender Wild Cabbage is a drought-tolerant plant adapted to arid conditions. It requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to fully dry between sessions, and benefits from very minimal to no fertilization due to its natural habitat in poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; naturally grows in nutrient-poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization.
