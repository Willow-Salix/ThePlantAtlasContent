## Care Guide
The Texas Bird-of-Paradise thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal water. It prefers well-draining soil and does not need frequent fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny landscapes. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring if desired.
