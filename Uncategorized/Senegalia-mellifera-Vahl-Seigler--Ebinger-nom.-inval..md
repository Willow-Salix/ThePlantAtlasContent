## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Africa (e.g., South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Sudan, Ethiopia) and the Arabian Peninsula |
| **Climate** | Arid and Semi-arid Savanna, Scrubland, and Desert margins |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure for at least 6-8 hours daily, mimicking its open, unshaded native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant; water sparingly, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Infrequent, deep watering is preferred over frequent shallow watering. |

## Introduction
Prunus spinosa, called blackthorn or sloe, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is native to Europe and West Asia, and has been naturalized in parts of North America.
The fruits are used to make sloe gin in Great Britain and patxaran in Basque Country. The wood is used to make walking sticks, including the Irish shillelagh.

## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun with minimal watering, making it highly drought-tolerant. It requires very little fertilization and prefers well-draining soil, mirroring its arid native environment.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; its native soils are generally poor. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring, or none at all in good soil, is sufficient.
