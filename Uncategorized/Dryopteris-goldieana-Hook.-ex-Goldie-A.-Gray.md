## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (primarily United States and Canada, from New Brunswick to Minnesota, south to North Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest (understory) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright to deep shade, tolerates some morning sun. Avoid direct afternoon sun, which can scorch fronds. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water regularly, especially during dry periods, ensuring the soil does not dry out completely. |

## Introduction
The moth genus Dryopteris is now considered a junior synonym of Oreta.

Dryopteris , commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to Dryopteris filix-mas), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales.
Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American Dryopteris hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization.
The fossil record of this genus shows that it was widespread even as far back as the Cretaceous with fossils being found in Late Cretaceous rock layers from North America down to Antarctica.

## Care Guide
Goldie's woodfern thrives in cool, shady, and consistently moist conditions, mimicking its native deciduous forest understory habitat. Ensure well-draining, rich soil and protect it from harsh direct sunlight. Provide consistent moisture to keep its fronds lush.

### Fertilizer
Prefers rich, organic soil. Apply a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer lightly in spring, or a diluted liquid feed during the growing season. Avoid over-fertilizing.
