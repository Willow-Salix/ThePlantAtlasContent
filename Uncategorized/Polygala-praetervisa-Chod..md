## Introduction
Polygala is a large genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygalaceae. They are commonly known as milkworts or snakeroots. The genus is distributed widely throughout much of the world in temperate zones and the tropics. The genus name Polygala comes from the ancient Greek "much milk", as the plant was thought to increase milk yields in cattle.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright conditions, from full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native humid subtropical to tropical habitat in Southeastern South America. It requires consistent moisture, preferring well-draining soil that doesn't become waterlogged, and benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growth phases.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, typical for plants in moderately fertile forest soils.
