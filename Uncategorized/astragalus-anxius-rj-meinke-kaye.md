## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and is exceptionally drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established. Given its nitrogen-fixing capabilities and adaptation to naturally poor, dry soils, fertilizer use should be sparse or avoided entirely to ensure healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Over-fertilization should be avoided; a very light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, if at all, is sufficient.
