## Care Guide
Indian Rosewood flourishes in full sun and requires consistent watering during its growing season, becoming more drought-tolerant once mature. As a nitrogen-fixing species, it has modest fertilizer needs. Ensure well-draining soil to replicate its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it is a nitrogen-fixing legume. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly during active growth.
