## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western and Central Europe, including Great Britain, Fennoscandia, and parts of continental Europe. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Oceanic/Humid Temperate Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light. This epiphytic lichen thrives in shaded or partially shaded environments, typically beneath a tree canopy, avoiding direct harsh sunlight. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity and frequent exposure to moisture from rain, mist, or dew. As a lichen, it absorbs moisture directly from the air and surfaces; it does not require soil watering. |

## Introduction
Fuscidea is a genus of crustose lichens in the family Fuscideaceae. It has about 40 species. The genus was circumscribed in 1972 by lichenologists Volkmar Wirth and Antonín Vězda, with Fuscidea aggregatilis assigned as the type species.

## Care Guide
Fuscidea arboricola thrives in the consistently moist and humid conditions typical of temperate European forests. Provide low to medium indirect light and ensure high ambient humidity with frequent exposure to moisture. Do not apply traditional fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens derive all necessary nutrients from atmospheric particles and rainwater. Traditional fertilizers are not only unnecessary but can be detrimental.
