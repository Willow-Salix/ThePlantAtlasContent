## 🌱 Overview
Krigia is a genus of North American flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Plants of the genus are known generally as dwarf dandelions or dwarfdandelions.
The species vary in morphology. They are annual or perennial herbs growing from a fibrous root system or a taproot. One species has rhizomes with tubers. The plants produce a single stem or up to 50 or more, usually growing erect, reaching a few centimeters to 75 centimeters tall. Most of the leaves are basal, but some stems have leaves higher up. The blades are often linear to lance-shaped, toothed or lobed, and borne on winged petioles. The flower heads are solitary, growing at the top of the stem or on stalks from the leaf axils. They contain up to 60 yellow or orange flowers. The fruit is a hairless, ribbed cypsela, sometimes with a pappus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dwarfdandelion thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil, though it can tolerate short dry periods. These resilient plants require minimal fertilization due to their adaptation to average native soil conditions, making them relatively low-maintenance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not heavy feeders. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in poor soils or for container plants, but often not essential.
