## Introduction
Digitaria is a genus of plants in the grass family native to tropical and warm temperate regions but can occur in tropical, subtropical, and cooler temperate regions as well. Common names include crabgrass, finger-grass, and fonio. They are slender monocotyledonous annual and perennial lawn, pasture, and forage plants; some are often considered lawn pests. Digitus is the Latin word for "finger", and they are distinguished by the long, finger-like inflorescences they produce.

## Care Guide
This adaptable plant prefers sunny locations with moderate water and average soil fertility, reflecting its nature as a common weed. It is very resilient and can tolerate periods of drought once established, requiring minimal intervention.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in average garden soil. High fertility is not strictly necessary but can promote more vigorous growth.
