| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida and the Gulf Coastal Plain) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to partial shade; protect from direct, intense sunlight which can cause desiccation. |

## Care Guide
This lichen requires a humid environment with indirect light, replicating its native subtropical forest habitat. It does not need soil-based watering or fertilization, absorbing all necessary moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens do not require traditional fertilizers, absorbing trace nutrients from air and precipitation.
