## Introduction
A birch is a thin-leaved deciduous hardwood tree of the genus Betula (), in the family Betulaceae, which also includes alders, hazels, and hornbeams. It is closely related to the beech-oak family Fagaceae. The genus Betula contains 30 to 60 known taxa of which 11 are on the IUCN 2011 Red List of Threatened Species. They are typically short-lived pioneer species and are widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in northern areas of temperate climates and in boreal climates. Birch wood is used for a wide range of purposes.

## Care Guide
This variety thrives in full to partial sun conditions, mirroring its native open subalpine and boreal habitats. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting the adequate rainfall in its native Northeastern North American range. Fertilize lightly in spring with a balanced formula, as native soils are not overly rich.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization in spring with a balanced, possibly slightly acidic formula, as native soils are typically not exceedingly rich.
