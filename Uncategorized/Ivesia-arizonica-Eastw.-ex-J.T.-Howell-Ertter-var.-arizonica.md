## Care Guide
This high-altitude native requires full to partial sun exposure and well-drained soil to thrive. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and fertilize minimally to replicate its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal, as it is adapted to the often rocky and less nutrient-rich soils of its native mountain habitat.
