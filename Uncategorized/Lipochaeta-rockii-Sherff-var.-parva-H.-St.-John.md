## Care Guide
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in warm conditions with plenty of sunlight, characteristic of its native tropical dry forests. Provide full to partial sun and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions to prevent root rot. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced feed during its active growing period.

### Fertilizer
