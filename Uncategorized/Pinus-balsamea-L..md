## Care Guide
Balsam Fir thrives in cool, moist climates similar to its native boreal and northern temperate forests. It prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained, acidic soil. Provide regular watering and minimal fertilization for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer for evergreens can be applied sparingly in spring if soil nutrients are deficient, but often not needed in good soil.
