## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (USA and Canada), particularly the intermountain west, including states like California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Sagebrush Steppe, characterized by hot, dry summers and cold winters with low to moderate precipitation. |
| **Sunlight** | High direct sunlight; requires full sun exposure for optimal growth, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent deep watering; highly drought-tolerant once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to simulate low native rainfall. |

## Introduction
Chrysothamnus, known as rabbitbrush, rabbitbush, and chamisa, are a genus of shrubs in the family Asteraceae. The native distribution is in the arid western United States, Canada, and northern Mexico. It is known for its bright white or yellow flowers in late summer.
Chrysothamnus may grow up to a 120 cm (47 in) tall shrub or subshrub, usually with woody stem bases.  The leaves are alternate, sessile or with short petioles, with entire edges. The flowerheads are singular or in clusters. Each composite flower often has five to 6 (though sometimes upwards of 40) yellow disc florets and no ray florets.
Chrysothamnus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora linosyridella, Coleophora viscidiflorella (which have both been recorded on C. viscidiflorus) and Schinia walsinghami.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and very dry conditions, requiring infrequent deep watering once established due to its high drought tolerance. It needs minimal to no fertilizer, preferring lean, well-draining soils. Mimic its arid native environment for best results.

### Fertilizer
Minimal or no fertilizer; thrives in lean, well-draining soils typical of arid regions and does not require rich nutrients.
