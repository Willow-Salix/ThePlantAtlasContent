## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia and South Asia (e.g., India, China, Malaysia, Indonesia) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Humid Climates |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and fruit production, mimicking its exposure in open tropical fields. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent and ample watering, especially during warm periods and when fruits are developing. The soil should be kept consistently moist but well-drained to avoid waterlogging, reflecting the regular rainfall in its native regions. |

## Introduction
Benincasa hispida, the wax gourd, also called ash gourd, white gourd, winter gourd, winter melon, tallow gourd, ash pumpkin, dongah or Chinese preserving melon, is a species of vine.
The wax gourd is native to South and Southeast Asia. It is grown, especially in Asia, for its very large fruit, eaten as a vegetable when mature. One variety of the plant, called chi qua (Benincasa hispida var. chieh-qua), is commonly used in Asian cuisine.

## Care Guide
Waxgourd flourishes in warm, tropical to subtropical conditions, demanding full sun exposure for optimal development. Consistent moisture and a nutrient-rich soil are crucial, supplemented with regular fertilization to support its vigorous vining and prolific fruit yield.

### Fertilizer
As a heavy feeder with rapid growth, it thrives in fertile, organically rich, well-draining soil. Benefits significantly from regular applications of a balanced fertilizer, particularly during flowering and fruiting stages.
