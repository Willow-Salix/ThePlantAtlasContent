## Care Guide
The California Black Oak thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its Mediterranean climate. It requires consistent watering when young, gradually transitioning to drought-tolerant care with minimal summer irrigation once established. Fertilization is generally not necessary for mature trees.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; established trees generally do not require fertilization. If soil is exceptionally poor or for young trees, a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly in late winter or early spring.
