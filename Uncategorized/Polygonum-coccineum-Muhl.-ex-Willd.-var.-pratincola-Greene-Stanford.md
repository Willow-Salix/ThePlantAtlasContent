## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate North America (United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Wetlands, Wet Meadows, and Riparian Zones |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. It thrives in open areas or with some dappled light, mimicking its natural habitat along open water bodies and wet fields. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to moist soil; can tolerate periodic inundation or standing water. It should never be allowed to dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## Care Guide
Scarlet Smartweed (var. pratincola) requires consistently wet to moist soil and thrives in full to partial sun. Mimic its native wetland habitat by ensuring high moisture levels and providing moderate to high fertility to support its vigorous growth habit.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Wetland environments are typically rich in organic matter and nutrients, so regular feeding during the growing season will support vigorous growth.
