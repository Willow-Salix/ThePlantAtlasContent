## Introduction
Tofieldia is a small genus of flowering plants described as a genus in 1778. It is widespread across much of Europe, Asia, and North America.
Tofieldia was once placed in the lily family, but is now generally included in the newer family Tofieldiaceae. The genus sometimes includes species of genus Triantha. Tofieldia are rhizomatous perennial herbs with spikes or racemes of lily-like flowers.
The name Tofieldia commemorates the British botanist Thomas Tofield.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in perpetually wet, even boggy, conditions with full to partial sun exposure. Ensure the soil remains consistently moist and avoid any drying periods. It is adapted to moderate nutrient levels, so fertilize sparingly.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to nutrient-poor or moderately fertile wetland soils. Fertilize sparingly and infrequently with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer.
