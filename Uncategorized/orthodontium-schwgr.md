| **🌍 Origin** | Australia, New Zealand, and temperate South America (e.g., Chile, Argentina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool-Temperate Woodland/Forest |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Orthodontium moss thrives in cool, humid environments with low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its forest floor habitat. It requires consistently damp substrate and high humidity, making regular misting or a terrarium setting ideal. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its minimal nutrient requirements.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses are not heavy feeders; they derive most nutrients from atmospheric deposition and decaying organic matter. Supplemental fertilizer is generally unnecessary and can be harmful.
