## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Great Basin region of the United States (eastern California, Nevada, and Utah). |
| **Climate** | Arid to semi-arid high desert, found on rocky slopes, sagebrush scrub, and pinyon-juniper woodlands at moderate to high elevations. |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun, needing at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day to thrive. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering should be avoided. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This resilient desert plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, making it ideal for arid or xeriscape gardens.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. It prefers lean to poor, well-drained soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
