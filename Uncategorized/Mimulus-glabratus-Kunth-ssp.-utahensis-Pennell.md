## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the southwestern United States (e.g., Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, California) |
| **Climate** | Found in wetlands, marshes, streambanks, and seeps within arid to semi-arid temperate regions; essentially a Riparian/Wetland microclimate. |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring more sun if adequate moisture is consistently provided. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to saturated soil, mimicking its natural habitat in springs, seeps, and streambanks. It can tolerate shallow standing water and should never be allowed to dry out. |

## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
This plant demands constant moisture, thriving in wet to saturated soil conditions, even tolerating shallow standing water. It performs best in full sun to partial shade and requires only moderate fertilization during its active growth period to mimic its wetland origins.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer during the growing season is sufficient. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
