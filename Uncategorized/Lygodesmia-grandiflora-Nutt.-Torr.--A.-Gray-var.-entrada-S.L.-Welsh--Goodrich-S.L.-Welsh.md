## Introduction
Lygodesmia, called skeletonplant, is a genus of North American flowering plants in the tribe Cichorieae within the family Asteraceae.
The name derives from the Greek lygos, a pliant twig, and desme, a bundle, because of the fascicled twiggy or rush-like stems of the plants.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, poor soils, mimicking its arid native habitat. Water sparingly, only when the soil is completely dry, as it is highly drought-tolerant and sensitive to overwatering. No significant fertilization is required for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; it thrives in nutrient-poor, well-draining soils.
