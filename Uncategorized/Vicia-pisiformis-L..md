## Care Guide
Pale-flower Vetch thrives in temperate conditions, preferring partial to full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires minimal fertilization, especially regarding nitrogen, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen, requiring little to no supplemental nitrogen. A low-nitrogen, balanced fertilizer or compost can be applied sparingly if soil nutrients are severely lacking.
