## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Bashful Four O'Clock is a drought-tolerant plant thriving in bright, sunny conditions, reflecting its native Semi-Arid Scrubland environment. Provide well-draining soil and water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to fully dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. Minimal fertilization is generally needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season is usually sufficient.
