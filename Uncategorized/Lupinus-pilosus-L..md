## Care Guide
This Mediterranean native thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, tolerating dry conditions once established. Being a legume, it requires minimal to no nitrogen fertilizer, preferring a low-nutrient environment or a balanced fertilizer if needed, with care to avoid waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no nitrogen fertilizer needed, as it is a legume and fixes nitrogen. A low-nitrogen, balanced fertilizer (or none) is usually sufficient, especially in moderate to poor soils.
