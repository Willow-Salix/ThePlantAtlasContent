## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (southeastern Washington, eastern Oregon, and Idaho) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-Arid Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily). |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, especially during dormant periods, to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.

## Care Guide
Packard's desertparsley thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native arid scrubland habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering with significant drying periods between sessions. Avoid over-fertilizing as it prefers nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to lean soils and does not require heavy fertilization. An annual application of a very light, balanced fertilizer in early spring, or no fertilizer at all, is generally sufficient.
