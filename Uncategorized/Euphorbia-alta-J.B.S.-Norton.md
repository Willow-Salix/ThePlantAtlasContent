## Care Guide
Originating from the semi-arid regions of South Africa, Euphorbia alta thrives in bright, sunny conditions. It demands well-draining soil and very infrequent watering, allowing the substrate to dry completely between applications to prevent root rot. This plant has minimal fertilizer requirements, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor native environments.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Fertilize sparingly (once or twice during the growing season) with a diluted, balanced succulent or cactus fertilizer.
