## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in warm, humid conditions mimicking its native subtropical and tropical habitats. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure consistent moisture during its active growth, allowing for good drainage. Moderate fertilization will support healthy growth, especially during warmer months.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer applied every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season is sufficient. As a legume, it may fix nitrogen, reducing its need for high nitrogen fertilizers.
