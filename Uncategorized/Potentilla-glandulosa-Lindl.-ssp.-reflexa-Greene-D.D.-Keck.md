## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Pacific Northwest to California) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, reflecting its native habitat in open meadows and forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out between sessions; drought-tolerant once established due to its adaptation to areas with dry summer periods. |

## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
Sticky cinquefoil thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and is quite drought-tolerant once established. Fertilizer needs are low, as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in lean to average soils characteristic of mountain slopes and meadows, suggesting minimal need for supplemental nutrients.
