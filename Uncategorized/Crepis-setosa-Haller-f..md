## Introduction
Crepis, commonly known in some parts of the world as hawksbeard or hawk's-beard (but not to be confused with the related genus Hieracium with a similar common name), is a genus of annual and perennial flowering plants of the family Asteraceae superficially resembling the dandelion, the most conspicuous difference being that Crepis usually has branching scapes with multiple heads (though solitary heads can occur). The genus name Crepis derives from the Greek krepis, meaning "slipper" or "sandal", possibly in reference to the shape of the fruit.
The genus is distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and Africa, and several plants are known as introduced species practically worldwide. The center of diversity is in the Mediterranean.

## Care Guide
Bristly Hawksbeard is a robust plant that thrives in full to partial sun, typical of open temperate environments. It prefers moderate watering but is quite tolerant of drier periods. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it naturally grows in average soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a common weed of average soils, it does not require rich fertilization; standard garden soil nutrients are usually sufficient.
