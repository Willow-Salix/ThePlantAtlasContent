## Care Guide
Parmelia subcentrifuga is a lichen, not a vascular plant, so care is quite different. It requires access to sunlight and moisture, but does not need soil or fertilizer. Air quality is a critical factor for its survival.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and rain.
