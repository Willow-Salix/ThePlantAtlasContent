# No widely recognized common name
### *Salix dubia Trautv.*

![No widely recognized common name](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Salix_alba_Morton.jpg)

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Asia, specifically mountainous regions such as the Tien Shan range, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Montane/Subalpine, characterized by cold winters, mild summers, and often high precipitation or consistent moisture from snowmelt, typically found along riverbanks and in moist alpine scrub. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers Full Sun to Partial Shade. In its native habitat, it grows in open, exposed areas along riverbanks or in montane scrub, receiving significant light exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its natural habitat along mountain rivers and streams where it has access to abundant water, especially from snowmelt and rainfall. Tolerates periods of saturated soil or temporary flooding. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This willow thrives in cool, consistently moist to wet conditions with ample sunlight, reflecting its native mountainous riverbank habitat. Ensure the soil remains constantly hydrated and provide full to partial sun exposure. A moderate fertilizer application in spring can support its robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer in spring to support its vigorous growth, particularly in poorer soils. Less critical in naturally rich, riparian soils where nutrients are readily available.
