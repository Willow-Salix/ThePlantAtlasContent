| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | New Zealand |

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in bright, open environments with high humidity and excellent air circulation. Provide frequent misting with pure water and avoid any conventional fertilization, as it acquires nutrients directly from its atmospheric environment.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization is required. Lichens absorb all necessary nutrients directly from the air and rainfall.
