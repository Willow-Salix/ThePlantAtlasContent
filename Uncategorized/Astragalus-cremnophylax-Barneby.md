## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Sentry Milkvetch thrives in conditions mirroring its native Grand Canyon habitat, demanding full sun and extremely infrequent watering. It requires exceptionally well-draining, poor soil, and should not be fertilized to prevent over-enrichment and potential root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers lean, low-nutrient soils. Fertilization is generally not recommended as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.
