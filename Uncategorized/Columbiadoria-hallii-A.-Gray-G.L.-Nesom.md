## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (California, Oregon, Washington) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine (dry meadows, rocky slopes) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth, mimicking its open, high-elevation native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water moderately during periods of active growth, reducing frequency in cooler or dormant periods to prevent root rot. |

## Care Guide
Hall's Columbiadoria thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its native rocky, open slopes. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring the soil to dry thoroughly between waterings. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to leaner nutrient conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. This plant is adapted to leaner soils; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring may be beneficial, but often it thrives without heavy feeding.
