## Care Guide
Modoc Cypress is a hardy, drought-tolerant conifer thriving in full sun and very well-drained, poor soils. Emulate its native montane Mediterranean climate by providing infrequent watering once established and avoiding excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required. It naturally grows in poor, rocky, often nutrient-deficient soils, so rich or heavily fertilized conditions are unnecessary and can be detrimental.
