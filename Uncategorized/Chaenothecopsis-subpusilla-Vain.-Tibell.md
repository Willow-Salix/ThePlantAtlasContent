## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern regions of Europe (e.g., Fennoscandia), North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska, Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes region), and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Boreal and Cool Temperate Coniferous Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to full shade. As an epixylic (growing on wood) lichen in dense forests, it requires protection from direct sunlight, thriving in the dappled light or consistent shade found on the forest floor or under canopy. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity and frequent moisture exposure. This lichen absorbs water directly from atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, mist) and its substrate, rather than through roots. It requires consistently moist air and surfaces; traditional 'watering' is not applicable or beneficial. |

## Introduction
Chaenothecopsis is a genus of about 40 species of pin lichens in the family Mycocaliciaceae.

## Care Guide
This pin lichen thrives in cool, highly humid environments typical of boreal and cool temperate coniferous forests. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture and indirect to full shade, typically growing on decaying wood. Avoid direct sun, air pollution, and any form of traditional fertilization, as these are detrimental.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens are highly sensitive to pollution and excess nutrients. They derive necessary trace elements from atmospheric deposition and the decaying organic matter of their substrate. Supplemental fertilizer is detrimental.
