## Introduction
Frankenia (sea heath) is the only genus in the Frankeniaceae family of flowering plants. Other genera have been recognized within the family, such as Anthobryum, Hypericopsis and Niederleinia, but molecular phylogenetic studies have consistently shown that they all belong inside Frankenia. Frankenia comprises about 70–80 species of shrubs, subshrubs and herbaceous plants, adapted to saline and dry environments throughout temperate and subtropical regions. A few species are in cultivation as ornamental plants.

## Care Guide
Johnston's Seaheath thrives in full sun and well-drained, potentially saline soils, mirroring its native coastal scrubland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering and minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilization. If needed, use a diluted, balanced fertilizer sparingly during the growing season.
