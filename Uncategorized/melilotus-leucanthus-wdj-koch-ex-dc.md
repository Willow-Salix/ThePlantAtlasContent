## 🌱 Overview
Melilotus, known as melilot or sweet clover is a genus of legumes in the family Fabaceae, native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. The genus is closely related to Trifolium (clovers). Several species are common grassland plants and weeds of cultivated ground, and some species are now found worldwide as naturalised plants.
The scientific and English names both derive from Greek melílōtos from méli (honey), and lōtos (lotus), via Latin melilōtos and Old French mélilot. The alternative name "sweet clover" varies in orthography, also cited as sweet-clover and sweetclover. Other names include "kumoniga", from the Cumans.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
White Sweetclover is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering, preferring to dry out slightly between sessions. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has very low fertilizer needs and can flourish in poor soil conditions, reflecting its nature as a pioneer species in disturbed areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low, as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil and can thrive in poor to moderately fertile conditions without significant added nutrients.
