## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily coastal Florida and Gulf Coast states) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Coastal Saltmarsh |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open marsh environments. |
| **💧 Water** | High; requires consistently saturated soil or shallow standing water, mimicking its native marsh habitat. Tolerates brackish conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Kosteletzkya is a genus of the plant family Malvaceae that includes the seashore mallow (K. pentacarpos). It includes about 19 species found worldwide.
Although similar in appearance to Hibiscus, Kosteletzkya typically bears more flattened capsules that dehisce loculicidally. The genus was separated from Hibiscus in 1835 by Carl Borivoj Presl, who named it after Vincenz Franz Kosteletzky (1801–1887).
Phylogenetic evidence supports this genus being polyphyletic, with New World and Malagasy species of Kosteletzkya belonging to completely different clades within the Hibisceae. Under a revised nomenclature, only New World species would retain the genus name Kosteletzkya. An alternate revision would be to merge all New World Kosteletzkya species into Hibiscus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This marsh plant thrives in full sun and demands consistently saturated or submerged soil, ideally in brackish conditions. Provide moderate fertilization during active growth to support its robust development in wetland-like environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced fertilizer during the growing season. Native marsh soils are often nutrient-rich from accumulated organic matter.
