## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America, including parts of Canada and the United States |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coniferous and Mixed Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Requires partial to full shade or dappled light; avoid direct, intense sunlight which can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and consistent atmospheric moisture are crucial. As an epiphyte, it absorbs water directly from rain, fog, and dew; does not require root watering. |

## Introduction
Tuckermannopsis is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. The genus contains about twelve species of foliose (leafy) to somewhat fruticose (bushy) lichens with brownish or greenish thalli. Species in Tuckermannopsis are found primarily in temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with centres of diversity in western North America and East Asia. Members of the genus are distinguished by their cetrarioid growth form, with reproductive structures largely restricted to the margins of the lobes, and the absence of usnic acid in their upper cortex.

## Care Guide
Cultivating this lichen requires mimicking its cool, moist forest habitat. Provide high humidity and dappled to indirect light, ensuring it remains consistently exposed to atmospheric moisture rather than direct watering. No additional fertilization is needed as it extracts nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rainfall, air quality).
