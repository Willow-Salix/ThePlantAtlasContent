## Care Guide
This tropical understory plant thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil and prefers partial to full shade, protected from direct harsh sunlight. Provide regular watering to maintain soil moisture and feed moderately during its growing season for optimal health, mimicking its humid, nutrient-cycling native environment.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding. Benefits from a balanced, liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during its active growing season (spring and summer).
