## Introduction
Lichinodium is a genus of filamentous lichens. It is the only genus in the family Lichinodiaceae, itself the only member of the order Lichinodiales. Lichinodium has four species. Previously considered part of the class Lichinomycetes, molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that Lichinodium represents a unique lineage in the Leotiomycetes—the first known group of lichen-forming fungi in this class.

## Care Guide
This unique aquatic lichen thrives in consistently cool temperatures, high humidity, and requires constant moisture, ideally mimicking a frequently splashed or submerged rock in a stream or waterfall. Provide low to moderate indirect light and absolutely prevent it from drying out, as it has no tolerance for desiccation.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from water and air; high nutrient levels can be detrimental.
