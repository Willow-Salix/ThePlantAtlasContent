## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico (Chihuahua, Coahuila, Sonora) |
| **Climate** | Arid Desert and Chihuahuan Desert scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright, direct light for most of the day, mimicking its open desert habitat. |
| **Watering** | Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water deeply but infrequently during the growing season (spring/summer). Reduce watering significantly, almost stopping, during winter dormancy to prevent rot. |

## Introduction
Coryphantha (from Greek, "flowering on the top"), or beehive cactus, is a genus of small to middle-sized, globose or columnar cacti. The genus is native to arid parts of Central America, Mexico, through Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas and north into southwestern, central, and southeastern Montana. With its two subgenera, 57 species and 20 subspecies, it is one of the largest genera of cactus.

## Care Guide
Scheer's Coryphantha is a desert cactus that thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to completely dry between waterings, and fertilize sparingly only during its active growth period to mimic its arid native environment.

### Fertilizer
Low. Fertilize once or twice during the growing season with a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer. Native desert soils are often nutrient-poor, so heavy feeding is not necessary.
