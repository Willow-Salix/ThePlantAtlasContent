## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Southeastern United States (e.g., Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky), particularly in limestone glades and prairies. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Humid Continental (or Subtropical) with distinct seasons, including hot summers and cold winters. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) to replicate its open prairie and glade habitat, ensuring robust growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering when young or during extended dry periods; established plants are highly drought-tolerant due to deep taproots and prefer well-drained soil, tolerating dry conditions between waterings. |

## Introduction
Silphium (also known as laserwort or laser; Ancient Greek: σίλφιον, sílphion) is an unidentified plant that was used in classical antiquity as a seasoning, perfume, aphrodisiac, and medicine.
It was an essential item of trade from the ancient North African city of Cyrene, and was so critical to the Cyrenian economy that most of their coins bore an image of the plant. The valuable product was the plant's resin, called in Latin laserpicium, lasarpicium, or laser (Laserpitium and Laser were used by botanists to name genera of aromatic plants, but the silphium plant is not believed to belong to these genera).
The exact identity of silphium is unclear. It was claimed to have become extinct in Roman times, but is commonly believed to be a relative of giant fennel in the genus Ferula. The extant plant Thapsia gummifera has been suggested as another possibility. Another theory is that it was simply a high-quality variety of asafoetida, a common spice in the Roman Empire. The two spices were considered the same by many Romans, including geographer Strabo.
Silphium was considered invaluable by all who held it. The plant was sung about by Roman poets and singers, who considered it equivalent to its weight in gold. Historically, Pliny the Elder blamed silphium's valuation on "tax-farmers", and Julius Caesar directly registered silphium as "1500 pounds of laser" in the Roman treasury.

## Care Guide
Gattinger's Rosinweed flourishes in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native glade and prairie environments. Once established, it is remarkably drought-tolerant, requiring minimal supplemental watering and no fertilizer, making it a very low-maintenance native perennial.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. These plants are adapted to typical prairie soils which can be moderately fertile but do not require rich amendments; excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth.
