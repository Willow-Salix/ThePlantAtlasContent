## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Southern China (Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan provinces) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, reflecting its native habitat on slopes, roadsides, and in open thickets where it receives good light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist soil, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Its native climate experiences good rainfall but also periods of less moisture, so it tolerates some drought once established. |

## Introduction
Jasmine (botanical name: Jasminum, pronounced  YAS-min-əm) is a genus of shrubs and vines in the olive family of Oleaceae. It contains around 200 species native to tropical and warm temperate regions of Eurasia, Africa, and Oceania. Jasmines are widely cultivated for the characteristic fragrance of their flowers. 
The village of Shubra Beloula in Egypt grows most of the jasmine used by the global perfume industry.

## Care Guide
Japanese Jasmine thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistent moisture in well-draining soil, mimicking its humid subtropical origins. Provide moderate fertilization during its active growth period for healthy development and abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer), as native soils are typically not excessively rich but provide adequate nutrients.
