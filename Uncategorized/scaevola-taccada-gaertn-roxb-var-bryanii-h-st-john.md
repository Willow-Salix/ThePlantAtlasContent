## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bryan's Scaevola thrives in full sun and well-draining conditions, typical of its native tropical coastal environment on Wake Island. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and use a low to moderate fertilizer regimen for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in less fertile coastal sandy soils; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is generally sufficient.
