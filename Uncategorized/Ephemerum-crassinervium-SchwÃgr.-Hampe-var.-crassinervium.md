## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Eastern North America (e.g., Eastern United States, Canada) and parts of Europe |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest Floor / Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Low to partial light. Thrives in shaded or partially shaded environments, avoiding direct, intense sunlight which can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist substrate. Water frequently enough to prevent the soil from drying out completely, ensuring good drainage to avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Tradescantia () is a genus of 85 species of herbaceous perennial wildflowers in the family Commelinaceae, native to the Americas from southern Canada to northern Argentina, including the West Indies. Members of the genus are known by many common names, including inchplant, wandering jew, spiderwort, dayflower and trad.
Tradescantia grow 30–60 cm  tall (1–2 ft), and are commonly found individually or in clumps in wooded areas and open fields. They were introduced into Europe as ornamental plants in the 17th century and are now grown in many parts of the world. Some species have become naturalized in regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and on some oceanic islands.
The genus's many species are of interest to cytogenetics because of evolutionary changes in the structure and number of their chromosomes. They have also been used as bioindicators for the detection of environmental mutagens. Some species have become pests to cultivated crops and considered invasive.

## Care Guide
Ephemerum moss thrives in consistently moist, shaded conditions typical of temperate forest floors. Ensure the substrate never dries out, but also provide good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Fertilization is generally not needed for this low-nutrient plant.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses generally do not require supplemental fertilization as they are adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Excess nutrients can be detrimental.
