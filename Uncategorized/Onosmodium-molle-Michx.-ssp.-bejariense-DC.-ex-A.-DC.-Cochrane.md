## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun conditions, reflecting its native grassland and open woodland habitats. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and requires low to moderate fertilizer, adapting to average soil conditions. Ensure well-drained soil to emulate its natural environment and prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in average, well-drained soils typical of its native range. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, slow-release formula only if soil is exceptionally poor.
