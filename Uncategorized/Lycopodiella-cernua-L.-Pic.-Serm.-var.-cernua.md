| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Humid Regions, typically found in wet, disturbed open areas like bogs, swamps, roadsides, and forest edges. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. While it can tolerate some direct morning sun, it prefers protection from harsh afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist; never allow it to dry out. Requires high humidity, which can be maintained through misting or a pebble tray. |

## Introduction
Lycopodiella is a genus in the clubmoss family Lycopodiaceae. The genus members are commonly called bog clubmosses, describing their wetland habitat. In the past, the genus was often incorporated within the related genus Lycopodium, but was segregated in 1964. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Lycopodiella is placed in the subfamily Lycopodielloideae, along with three other genera. In this circumscription, the genus has about 15 species. Other sources use a wider circumscription, in which the genus is equivalent to the Lycopodielloideae of PPG I, in which case about 40 species and hybrids are accepted. Narrowly circumscribed, the genus has a circumboreal distribution, extending south in the Americas throughout tropical South America.

## Care Guide
This staghorn clubmoss thrives in warm, humid conditions with consistently moist soil that never dries out. Provide bright indirect light to partial sun, protecting it from intense afternoon sun. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, using a very dilute solution during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization. If necessary, use a highly diluted balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly during the growing season (e.g., once every 1-2 months).
