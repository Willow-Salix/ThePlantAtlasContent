## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wetland grass requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, ideally mimicking its native habitat in full sun to partial shade. Do not let the soil dry out, as it thrives in saturated environments. It is a low to moderate feeder, benefiting from minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer once in spring may be beneficial, but it's not a heavy feeder.
