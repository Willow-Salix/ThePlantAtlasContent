## Care Guide
The Hairy Desertsunflower is a resilient desert plant that thrives in arid conditions. It demands full, direct sunlight and requires very little water, preferring the soil to dry out thoroughly between infrequent waterings. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant is adapted to poor, lean desert soils and generally does not require fertilization. If used, apply a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly once a year in spring.
