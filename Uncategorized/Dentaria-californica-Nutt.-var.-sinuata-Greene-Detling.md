## Introduction
A milkmaid, milk maid, milkwoman, dairymaid, or dairywoman is a girl or woman who works with milk or cows.  She milks cows and may prepare dairy products such as cream, butter, and cheese. The term milkmaid is not the female equivalent of milkman in the sense of one who delivers milk to the consumer;  it is the female equivalent of milkman in the sense of cowman or dairyman. 
In 1600s-1800s, English milkmaids sold milk wearing a yoke supporting two milk pails and vending vessels, and also decorated themselves for the London May Day procession.

## Care Guide
This woodland ephemeral thrives in cool, shaded conditions with consistently moist, well-drained, organically rich soil during its active growth phase in late winter and spring. It goes dormant as summer approaches, requiring less water during this period. Protect from intense direct sun.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from rich, organic soil. Apply a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer or compost lightly in early spring during active growth.
