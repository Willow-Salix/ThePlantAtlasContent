## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Australian Desert Lime thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering due to its adaptation to arid climates, making it highly drought-tolerant. It has low fertilizer needs, preferring well-drained soil, and should be protected from overwatering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Adapted to poor, sandy soils; excessive fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental. A balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial.
