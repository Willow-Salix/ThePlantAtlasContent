## Introduction
Sclerocactus ("hard cactus", from Greek; refers to the hard, dry fruit) is a genus of cacti.  It comprises about 15 species, the exact number depending on the authority. These species are xerophytic. They are sometimes called 'fishhook cactus' or 'little barrels.'

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in full, direct sun and requires extremely minimal water, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between waterings to prevent root rot. Provide a well-draining soil mix and fertilize sparingly with a diluted cactus formula during its spring and early summer growing period.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization; use a low-nitrogen, high-potassium cactus fertilizer diluted to half strength once or twice during the active growing season (spring to early summer).
