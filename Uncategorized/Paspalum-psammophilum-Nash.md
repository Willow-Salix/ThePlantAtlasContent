# Sand Paspalum
### *Paspalum psammophilum Nash*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often in sandy pine barrens, coastal plains, or open savannas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, consistent with its open, sandy habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. While tolerant of some drought due to its adaptation to fast-draining sandy soils, it thrives with consistent moisture. Water deeply when the top inch or two of soil feels dry. |

## 🌱 Overview
Paspalum is a genus of plants in the grass family.
The group is widespread across much of Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. Commonly known as paspalum, bahiagrasses, crowngrasses or dallis grasses, many of the species are tall perennial New World grasses. They are warm-season C4 grasses and are most diverse in subtropical and tropical regions.
Paspalum scrobiculatum (koda, varuka, varuku, etc.) is a millet locally grown as food grain. Some species, such as bahiagrass (P. notatum) and P. nicorae, are grown for pasturage, especially with the perennial forage peanut (Arachis glabrata) as a companion crop. Bahiagrass has also some significance as a honey plant.
Water finger-grass (P. vaginatum) resembles bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), but has a higher salinity tolerance and can consume greywater. It is not infrequently used for arena and golf course turf in warmer coastal regions, such as Baja California, Florida, Peru, Texas and Venezuela. Dedicated paspalum cultivars such as 'Aloha Seashore' or 'Platinum TE' have been produced for such uses.
Paspalums are also food for caterpillars of lepidopterans such as the pasture day moth (Apina callisto), and those of the dark palm dart (Telicota ancilla) which feed on P. urvillei. Granivorous birds often eat paspalum seeds; the chestnut-breasted munia (Lonchura castaneothorax) readily feeds on the seeds of  P. longifolium, for example.
The ergot Claviceps paspali is a sac fungus that grows on Paspalum, producing ergot alkaloids and the tremorgen paspalitrem; it causes "paspalum staggers" poisoning in cattle.
Tussock paspalum (P. quadrifarium) is considered a noxious weed in Australia. The term “paspalum” without qualification in Australia refers to the common lawn weed P. dilatatum.  Australia has five native  and approximately sixteen naturalised species.
Daikin Park, the home ballpark of the Houston Astros, has Platinum TE Paspalum as its field surface.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This grass thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, mimicking its native southeastern US habitat. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and fertilize lightly if at all. It is well-suited for xeriscaping or sandy garden areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils, it does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer once in spring may be beneficial for vigorous growth.
