*Felicia amoena (Sch. Bip.) Levyns* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Cape Provinces, South Africa |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland (Fynbos) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun is preferred for optimal flowering; can tolerate light partial shade in very hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the top soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring less frequent watering in cooler, wetter periods. |

## Introduction
The name Felicia derives from the Latin adjective felix, meaning "happy, lucky", though in the neuter plural form felicia it literally means "happy things" and often occurred in the phrase tempora felicia, "happy times". The sense of it as a feminine personal name appeared in post-Classical use and is of uncertain origin. It is associated with saints, poets, astronomical objects, plant genera, fictional characters, and animals, especially cats.

## Care Guide
Felicia Amoena thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native South African fynbos habitat. It requires moderate watering, tolerating dry periods once established, and benefits from minimal fertilization due to adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilization needs. Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly in spring, particularly if grown in containers or very poor soil.
