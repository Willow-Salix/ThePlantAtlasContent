## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Rocky Mountains, ranging from Alberta and British Columbia south to New Mexico and Arizona, and west to Nevada and California. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine Montane regions |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring significant light exposure typical of high-altitude environments. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistent moisture during the growing season in well-drained soil; intolerant of waterlogging. Allow soil to dry slightly between waterings. Reduce watering significantly in winter when dormant. |

## Introduction
Androsace, commonly known as rock jasmine, is a genus of flowering plants in the  family Primulaceae, second only to Primula in the number of species. It is predominantly Arctic–alpine, with many species in the Himalayas (where the genus originated), the mountains of central Asia, the Caucasus, and the southern and central European mountain systems, particularly the Alps and the Pyrenees.
Plants of this genus are sometimes known as rock jasmines or fairy candelabras, and are widely cultivated for their dense cushions covered in white or pink flowers. There are roughly 110 species.
These plants have small entire or toothed leaves which form a basal rosette.

## Care Guide
This alpine perennial thrives in bright, sunny conditions with excellent drainage, mimicking its native Rocky Mountain habitat. Ensure consistent but not excessive moisture during the growing season and provide lean soil with minimal fertilization. Protect from winter wetness and hot, humid conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. Alpine soils are typically lean. A very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich or amended soil.
