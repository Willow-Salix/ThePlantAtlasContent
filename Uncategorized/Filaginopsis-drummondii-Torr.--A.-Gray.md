## Introduction
Filago is a genus of plants in the sunflower family, native from Europe and northern Africa to Mongolia, Nepal, and Macaronesia. They are sometimes called cottonroses or cudweeds.
The name cudweed comes from the fact that they were once used to feed cows that had lost the ability to chew the cud.
Several species are sometimes treated as members of the genus Logfia.

## Care Guide
Drummond's Cudweed is a low-maintenance annual that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflective of its native open habitats. It requires moderate watering, tolerating dry spells, and has very low nutrient demands, making it an easy-care plant.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. This plant is adapted to grow in sandy and often nutrient-poor soils, so minimal to no fertilization is typically required.
