## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA and Southern Oregon, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Warm, Dry Summer/Mild, Wet Winter) / Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) to thrive. Can tolerate some partial shade in hotter climates, but full sun is ideal for best growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. More frequent watering may be needed during prolonged dry spells or extreme heat, especially for young plants. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Silver Lupine thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established, preferring well-draining soil. As a nitrogen-fixer, it needs minimal to no fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant. Mimic its native Mediterranean climate by providing ample sunlight and infrequent watering.

### Fertilizer
Generally does not require fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. If necessary, a low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus/potassium fertilizer can be applied sparingly in poor soils, but over-fertilization can be detrimental.
