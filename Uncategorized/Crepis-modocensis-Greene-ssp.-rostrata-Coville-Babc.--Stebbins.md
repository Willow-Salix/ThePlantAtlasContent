## Introduction
Crepis, commonly known in some parts of the world as hawksbeard or hawk's-beard (but not to be confused with the related genus Hieracium with a similar common name), is a genus of annual and perennial flowering plants of the family Asteraceae superficially resembling the dandelion, the most conspicuous difference being that Crepis usually has branching scapes with multiple heads (though solitary heads can occur). The genus name Crepis derives from the Greek krepis, meaning "slipper" or "sandal", possibly in reference to the shape of the fruit.
The genus is distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and Africa, and several plants are known as introduced species practically worldwide. The center of diversity is in the Mediterranean.

## Care Guide
Modoc Hawksbeard thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring dry conditions typical of its native arid and semi-arid habitats. Water sparingly, allowing significant dry periods, and avoid excessive fertilization for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring if soil is very poor.
