## Introduction
Chrysosplenium (golden saxifrage or golden-saxifrage) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Saxifragaceae. It includes 84 species found throughout the Arctic and northern temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere. The highest species diversity is in eastern Asia, and some species are found disjunctly in South America.
They are soft herbaceous perennial plants growing to 20 centimeters (8 in) tall, typically in wet, shady locations in forests. The leaves are rounded, palmately veined, with a lobed margin and arranged either alternately or opposite, depending on the species. The flowers are small, yellow or yellowish-green, with four petals; they are produced in small clusters at the apex of the shoots surrounded by leafy bracts. Most of the growth and flowering is in early spring, when more light is available under deciduous trees.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded environments. Mimic its subarctic native habitat by ensuring high humidity, regular watering without waterlogging, and protection from any periods of dryness or intense direct sun.

### Fertilizer
Low; a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season, or incorporate organic matter into the soil.
