## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic regions, including Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Siberia, Alaska, and mountainous alpine zones of North America and Eurasia. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in exposed, treeless environments with continuous summer daylight in its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering with excellent drainage. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings, mimicking the well-drained, meltwater-fed conditions of its native environment, and preventing waterlogging in cold soils. |

## Introduction
The Arctic poppy (Papaver radicatum) is a flowering plant in the Papaveraceae family. It may also be referred to as rooted poppy or yellow poppy. Arctic poppies grow in cold climate conditions and are found in Arctic regions throughout the world. Arctic poppies have adaptations, such as heliotropism and physical characteristics, which help them survive in the harsh environment they grow in.

## Care Guide
The Rooted Poppy thrives in full sun with excellent drainage, similar to its native Arctic and Alpine tundra. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and avoid rich fertilization as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to thin, nutrient-poor, rocky soils characteristic of tundra environments and does not require rich fertilization.
