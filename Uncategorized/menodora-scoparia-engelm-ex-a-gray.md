## 🧤 Care Instructions
Broom Menodora thrives in full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its arid native desert environment. It is extremely drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and performs best with minimal to no fertilization. Mimicking these harsh conditions is essential for its care.
