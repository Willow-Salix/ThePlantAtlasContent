## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Sierra Nevada mountains of California, USA |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane / Mediterranean Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers full sun in cooler areas, but can benefit from afternoon shade in very hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low watering once established. Adapted to dry summers, so water deeply but infrequently during prolonged dry periods, especially during active growth and flowering. |

## Introduction
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## Care Guide
This California native thrives in full sun with well-draining soil, mimicking its montane meadow origins. Once established, it is drought-tolerant, requiring only occasional watering during prolonged dry spells. Minimal fertilization is needed for healthy growth and abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Generally low fertilizer needs. Can benefit from a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially in poor soils, but often thrives without supplemental feeding.
