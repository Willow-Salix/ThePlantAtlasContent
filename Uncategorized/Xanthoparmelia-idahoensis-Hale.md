## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Idaho, Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains, northern Great Plains) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane and Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | High direct light to full sun exposure, mimicking its natural open, rocky habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent but thorough wetting, allowing complete drying between moisture events. Tolerant of prolonged dry periods, as lichens absorb water directly from the atmosphere. |

## Introduction
Xanthoparmelia (commonly known as green rock shields or rock-shield lichens) is a genus of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. This genus of lichen is commonly found in the United States, South America, southern Africa, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
The name means 'golden yellow parmelia'. The photobiont (photosynthetic partner) is Trebouxia (a genus of green algae).

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives with high direct light and infrequent, thorough watering followed by complete drying periods. It requires no fertilization as it obtains nutrients from the air and substrate. Avoid prolonged wetness to ensure its health.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens acquire all necessary nutrients from airborne particles and the substrate, making external fertilization unnecessary and potentially harmful.
