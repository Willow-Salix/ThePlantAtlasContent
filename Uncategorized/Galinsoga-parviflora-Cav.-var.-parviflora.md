## Care Guide
This adaptable plant, native to the montane tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires regular watering to maintain consistently moist soil, though it can tolerate brief dry spells. As a hardy species, it has low to moderate fertilizer needs and performs well in average to moderately fertile soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It is not a heavy feeder; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly, especially in poor soils, or generally not needed if grown in fertile soil.
