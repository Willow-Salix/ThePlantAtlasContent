## Care Guide
Parish's Wheatgrass is a hardy, drought-tolerant perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions. It requires full sun and thrives in well-drained, lean soils with minimal supplemental watering once established. Avoid excessive fertilization to maintain its natural resilience.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in infertile to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization is generally not recommended as it can reduce hardiness.
