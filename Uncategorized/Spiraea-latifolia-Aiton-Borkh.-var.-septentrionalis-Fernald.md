## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, including northeastern United States (e.g., Maine, New Hampshire, New York) and eastern Canada (e.g., Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Moist Woodlands and Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun for optimal flowering and growth, but tolerates partial shade, especially in warmer regions or during the hottest parts of the day. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist soil; its native habitat in wetlands and streambanks indicates a need for regular and abundant watering, avoiding dry periods. |

## Introduction
Spiraea , sometimes spelled spirea in common names, and commonly known as meadowsweets or steeplebushes, is a genus of about 80 to 100 species of shrubs in the family Rosaceae. They are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest diversity in eastern Asia.
The genus formerly included the herbaceous species now segregated into the genera Filipendula and Aruncus; recent genetic evidence has shown that Filipendula is only distantly related to Spiraea, belonging in the subfamily Rosoideae.

## Care Guide
Northern Meadowsweet thrives in consistently moist, well-drained soils under full sun to partial shade. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, and provide moderate fertilization to support its robust growth and flowering characteristic of its temperate wetland origins.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to low. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied in early spring, or enrichment with organic compost to mimic its nutrient-rich native soils.
