## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean region, including Southern Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland and Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open habitat in its native range. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry Mediterranean summers. Water moderately during active growth (fall/winter/spring), allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Minimal to no supplemental water needed during hot, dry summer dormancy. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mosquitograss thrives in full sun and well-drained, even poor, soils, mimicking its Mediterranean origins. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring moderate water only during active growth in cooler months and tolerating dry conditions in summer. Minimal fertilization is typically needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to the often nutrient-poor soils of the Mediterranean. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be used if soil is exceptionally poor, but it is generally not a heavy feeder.
