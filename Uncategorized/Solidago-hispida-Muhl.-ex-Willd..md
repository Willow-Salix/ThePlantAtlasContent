Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia.

## Care Guide
Hairy Goldenrod is a low-maintenance plant that prefers full sun and well-drained, average to poor soils. It requires low to moderate watering and is very drought-tolerant once established, making it ideal for naturalized or xeriscape gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in average to poor, well-drained soils without the need for significant fertilization. Over-fertilizing can lead to leggy growth.
