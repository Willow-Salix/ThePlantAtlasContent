## Introduction
Aureolaria, with the common name false foxgloves, is a genus of 8 species, native to North America.
Aureolaria plants are hemiparasitic, which is a character that in part describes the family Orobanchaceae.
Until recently the genus was aligned with members of the family Scrophulariaceae.  As a result of numerous molecular phylogenetic studies based on various chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) loci, it was shown to be more closely related to members of the Orobanchaceae.
