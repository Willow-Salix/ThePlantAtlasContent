## Care Guide
As a tropical lichen, Myriotrema glaucescens needs a consistently humid environment with indirect, filtered light. Ensure frequent misting or a high-humidity setup to maintain moisture, and avoid direct sunlight and traditional fertilizers, as its nutrient needs are met atmospherically.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. As a lichen, it obtains nutrients primarily from the air and rainfall; traditional fertilizers are unnecessary and potentially harmful.
