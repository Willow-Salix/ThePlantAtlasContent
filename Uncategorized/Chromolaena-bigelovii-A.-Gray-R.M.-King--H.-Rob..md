## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and northern Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland to Semi-Arid Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. This plant thrives in the high light exposure typical of its native desert and scrubland habitats, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sun daily. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent but deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to sporadic rainfall in arid regions. |

## Introduction
Chromolaena is a genus of about 165 species of perennials and shrubs in the family Asteraceae. The name is derived from the Greek words χρῶμα (khrôma), meaning "color", and χλαῑνα (khlaīna) or λαῑνα (laīna) meaning "cloak". It refers to the colored phyllaries of some species. Members of the genus are native to the Americas, from the southern United States to South America (especially Brazil).  One species, Chromolaena odorata, has been introduced to many parts of the world where it is considered a weed.
The plants of this genus were earlier taxonomically classified under the genus Eupatorium, but are now considered to be more closely related to other genera in the tribe Eupatorieae.

## Care Guide
Bigelow's Thoroughwort thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid environment, requiring full to partial sun and excellent drainage. Provide infrequent, deep watering and use fertilizer sparingly, as it is adapted to lean soils and drought.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to lean, well-draining soils that are not rich in nutrients. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, using a balanced, diluted fertilizer only during its active growing season.
