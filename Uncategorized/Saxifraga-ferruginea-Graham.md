## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, northern California, Idaho, and Montana. |
| **Climate** | Alpine/Subalpine Moist Environments |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers cooler conditions and can tolerate more sun in cooler climates or partial shade in warmer ones. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil. Requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, to mimic the constant moisture from snowmelt in its native habitat; avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
Cultivate in a cool, moist setting with full sun to partial shade and consistently damp, well-draining soil. Provide regular watering to simulate its native snowmelt-fed habitat and apply light fertilization for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in lean, mineral-rich soils. A light application of balanced granular fertilizer or diluted liquid feed once in spring is generally sufficient.
