## Introduction
Megaskepasma is a monotypic genus of plants containing the single species Megaskepasma erythrochlamys, known by the common name Brazilian red-cloak. Native to Venezuela and Suriname, it is a free branching, upright showy tropical shrub that grows to 3 m high with appressed reddish hairs, stout stems, and broad ovate  12–30 cm long dark green leaves with pink midrib. It is grown as an ornamental shrub in climates from warm temperate to tropical for its inflorescence, large erect heads of conspicuous crimson bracts, and two-lipped white flowers. This plant prefers a rich soil and is propagated from seed or cuttings.

## Care Guide
Brazilian Red-cloak thrives in warm, humid tropical conditions with bright indirect to partial sunlight. It requires consistent moisture in well-draining soil, mimicking its rainforest origins, and benefits from regular fertilization during its active growth to support its vibrant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Regular feeding during the active growing season (spring through fall) with a balanced liquid fertilizer or a slow-release granular fertilizer, due to high nutrient demand in fast-draining tropical soils.
