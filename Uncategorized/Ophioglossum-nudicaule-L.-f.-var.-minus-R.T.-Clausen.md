## Introduction
Ophioglossum, the adder's-tongue ferns, is a genus of about 50 species of ferns in the family Ophioglossaceae. The genus name comes from Ancient Greek ὄφις (óphis), meaning "snake", and γλῶσσα (glôssa), meaning "tongue". Their cosmopolitan distribution is mainly in tropical and subtropical habitats.
The genus has the largest number of chromosomes in the known plant kingdom, but contrary to popular belief does not have the largest number of chromosomes out of all known organisms, falling short to the protist Sterkiella histriomuscorum.

## Care Guide
This small, terrestrial fern thrives in tropical and subtropical environments with bright indirect light or partial shade. It needs consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from light fertilization during its growing season. Avoid waterlogging at all costs.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Apply a diluted balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer).
