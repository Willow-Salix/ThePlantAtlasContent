## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA, and Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland / Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its natural habitat in open, exposed areas with little canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring water only during prolonged dry spells or extreme heat, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Eriophyllum, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a North American genus of plants in the family Asteraceae. The genus is native to western North America (USA, Canada, northwestern Mexico), with a concentration of narrow endemics in California.
Eriophyllum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Phymatopus californicus.

## Care Guide
Golden-Yarrow thrives in full sun, mirroring its native open scrubland environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established and adapting well to lean, unfertilized soils. Avoid overwatering and rich soil to prevent root rot and leggy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils characteristic of scrubland environments; excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
