## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean climate, specifically in ephemeral moist habitats such as drying mud flats, vernal pool margins, and disturbed, damp soil during the wet season. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. While found in 'open areas', its liverwort nature dictates avoidance of intense, direct sun, which can cause rapid desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist substrate; never allow it to dry out completely. Regular watering or high ambient humidity is essential for its survival and reproduction. |

## Introduction
Riccia is a genus of liverworts in the order Marchantiales.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor environments, and high fertilizer concentrations can be detrimental.
