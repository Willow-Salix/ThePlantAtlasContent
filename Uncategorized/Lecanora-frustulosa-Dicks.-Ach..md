## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate to arctic-alpine regions across Europe, North America, and Asia, particularly montane areas. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Arctic-Alpine (montane/sub-alpine environments) |
| **Sunlight** | High direct sun exposure. Thrives on exposed rock surfaces. |
| **Watering** | Primarily obtains moisture from atmospheric sources like rain, dew, mist, and snowmelt. Tolerates periods of desiccation and rehydrates when moisture is available. Does not require root watering. |

## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
As a lichen, Lecanora frustulosa thrives in exposed, high-light environments on siliceous rocks in temperate to arctic-alpine regions. It requires atmospheric moisture for hydration, not root watering, and obtains nutrients from the air and rock. Replicating its natural rocky, well-lit, and moist-air habitat is key for its survival, without the need for soil or conventional fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no traditional fertilizer required. Obtains necessary nutrients from the air and minerals leached from the rock substrate.
