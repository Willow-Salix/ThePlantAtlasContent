## 🧤 Care Instructions
Doyerea thrives in conditions mimicking its native Madagascar dry forests, requiring ample sunlight and extremely well-draining soil. It is crucial to allow the soil to dry completely between waterings, especially minimizing water during dormancy, to prevent caudex rot and ensure its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder. Apply a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer) only, as native soils are not exceptionally rich.
