## Care Guide
Ipil thrives in warm, humid conditions typical of tropical rainforests, requiring abundant light (full to partial sun) and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide moderate, balanced fertilization, keeping in mind its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, and ensure it is protected from cold temperatures to mimic its native environment.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula, especially during the growing season. As a legume, Intsia bijuga fixes atmospheric nitrogen, reducing the need for high nitrogen input.
