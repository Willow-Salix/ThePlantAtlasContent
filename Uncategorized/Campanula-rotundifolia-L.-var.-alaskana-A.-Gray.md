## Introduction
Campanula () is the type genus of the Campanulaceae family of flowering plants. Campanula are commonly known as bellflowers and take both their common and scientific names from the bell-shaped flowers—campanula is Latin for "little bell".
The genus includes over 500 species and several subspecies, distributed across the temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with centers of diversity in the Mediterranean region, Balkans, Caucasus and mountains of western Asia. The range also extends into mountains in tropical regions of Asia and Africa.

The species include annual, biennial and perennial plants, and vary in habit from dwarf arctic and alpine species under 5 cm high, to large temperate grassland and woodland species growing to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall.

## Care Guide
This hardy plant thrives in cool, exposed conditions, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It prefers lean to moderately rich soil and should not be over-fertilized. Ensure good drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; prefers lean to moderately fertile soil. A light, balanced fertilizer in early spring if soil is very poor, otherwise often not needed.
