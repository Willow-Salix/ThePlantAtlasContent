## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (coastal plains and sandhills of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical, specifically in pine barrens and pocosin ecosystems with sandy, peaty soils |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Prefers protection from harsh afternoon sun, thriving in dappled light conditions or open ground not exposed to intense midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist; the sandy, peaty substrate should not be allowed to dry out completely. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
This rare moss requires a consistently moist, acidic substrate that mimics its native sandy, peaty soils. Provide bright indirect to partial sun, avoiding intense afternoon exposure. Fertilization is generally unnecessary due to its extremely low nutrient demands, as it thrives on atmospheric and substrate micro-nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required. Mosses generally thrive on minimal nutrients obtained from their environment.
