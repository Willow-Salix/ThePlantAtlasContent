## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rare moss requires a consistently moist, acidic substrate that mimics its native sandy, peaty soils. Provide bright indirect to partial sun, avoiding intense afternoon exposure. Fertilization is generally unnecessary due to its extremely low nutrient demands, as it thrives on atmospheric and substrate micro-nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required. Mosses generally thrive on minimal nutrients obtained from their environment.
