## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including northern North America (Alaska, Canada, Greenland), Northern Europe, and Northern Asia, typically in subarctic and alpine zones. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subarctic Tundra / Boreal Forest (cold temperate to subarctic climate with cool, moist summers and cold winters) |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to moderate indirect light. Avoid harsh, direct sunlight, especially during the hottest parts of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. High ambient humidity is crucial; replicate by misting or using a pebble tray. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lycopodium (from Ancient Greek lykos, wolf and podion, diminutive of pous, foot) is a genus of clubmosses, also known as ground pines or creeping cedars, in the family Lycopodiaceae. Two very different circumscriptions of the genus are in use. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Lycopodium is one of nine genera in the subfamily Lycopodioideae, and has from nine to 15 species. In other classifications, the genus is equivalent to the whole of the subfamily, since it includes all of the other genera. More than 40 species are accepted.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This clubmoss thrives in cool, moist, and humid environments, mimicking its subarctic and boreal forest origins. Provide consistent moisture to the soil without waterlogging, and ensure high humidity. It prefers partial shade to moderate indirect light and does not require heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilization needs. If fertilizing, use a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once or twice during the growing season). Prefers acidic soil.
