## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily West Texas, New Mexico, Arizona) and northern Mexico, within the Chihuahuan Desert region. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Chihuahuan Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat's open and exposed desert conditions. |
| **Watering** | Low watering needs; highly drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking sparse desert rainfall. |

## Introduction
Anisacanthus is a genus of flowering plants in the bear's breeches family, Acanthaceae. The generic name is derived from the Greek words ἄνισος (ánisos), meaning "unequal," and ἄκανθος (ákanthos), meaning "spine, thorn." Members of the genus are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are commonly known as desert honeysuckles, though this term is shared with the genus Ancistranthus, and is something of a misnomer as true honeysuckles (genus Lonicera) belong to the family Caprifoliaceae. Anisacanthus species are sometimes cultivated for use in xeriscaping.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil, reflecting its native arid desert environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering once established, and has very low fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny locations.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native desert soils are typically lean, so this plant is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. Excessive fertilization can be harmful.
