## Care Guide
The Carrotwood tree thrives in subtropical to tropical environments, preferring a location with full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. While young plants benefit from regular watering, established trees are quite resilient and require minimal fertilization. This species is generally low-maintenance once mature.

### Fertilizer
Generally not a heavy feeder. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring for young or containerized plants, but established trees in suitable soil typically require minimal fertilization.
