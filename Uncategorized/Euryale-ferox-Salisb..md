## Introduction
Euryale ferox, commonly known as prickly waterlily, makhānā, or Gorgon plant, is a species of water lily found in southern and eastern Asia, and the only extant member of the genus Euryale. The edible seeds, called fox nuts or gorgon nuts, are dried and eaten predominantly in Asia. 
The plant is cultivated for its seeds in lowland ponds in India, China, and Japan. The Indian state of Bihar produces 90% of the world's fox nuts. The Chinese have cultivated the plant for centuries. In India, more than 96,000 hectares of Bihar were set aside for cultivation of Euryale in 1990–1991. In the northern and western parts of India, the seeds are often roasted or fried like popcorn.

## Care Guide
Euryale ferox thrives in warm, still freshwater under full sun or partial shade, mirroring its native wetland habitats. Ensure a consistently submerged environment with a nutrient-rich substrate to support its growth as an aquatic plant.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a nutrient-rich muddy or silty substrate, indicating moderate to high fertilizer needs, especially for robust growth and seed production.
