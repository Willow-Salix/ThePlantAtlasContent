## 🌱 Overview
Kallstroemia is a genus of flowering plants in the caltrop family, Zygophyllaceae. The approximately 20 species it contains are native to tropical and warm temperate regions of the Americas. The flower and fruit morphology is similar to Tribulus. The convex fruits separate into about 10 nutlets each with one seed. The genus is named after A. Kallstroem who lived in the 18th century.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
California Caltrop thrives in full sun with minimal watering, mimicking its native arid environments. It prefers well-draining soil and does not require heavy fertilization, making it a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant suited for hot, dry conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils characteristic of its native environment. A light, balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season may be sufficient, or none at all in naturally rich soil.
