## Care Guide
Thelignya lichens thrive in bright, direct sunlight conditions typical of their arid to Mediterranean native habitats. They require very infrequent watering, relying on atmospheric moisture, and should never be overwatered to avoid rot. No fertilization is needed, as they have extremely low nutrient demands and are sensitive to excess.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient requirements; fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental. Absorbs trace minerals from dust and atmospheric deposition.
