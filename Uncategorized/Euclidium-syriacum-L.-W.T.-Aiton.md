## Care Guide
Syrian Mustard is a resilient, low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained, even poor, soils. It requires infrequent to moderate watering, tolerating dry spells once established, and has minimal fertilization needs.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to poor to moderately fertile soils and does not require heavy fertilization, as it grows readily in disturbed, less nutrient-rich areas.
