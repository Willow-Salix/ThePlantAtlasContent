## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern and Central Europe (e.g., Fennoscandia, British Isles, Germany), and scattered regions in North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forest Biome (specifically old-growth deciduous or mixed forests). |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Mimic the dappled light conditions found on tree bark within a forest canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high ambient humidity and regular wetting from mist or rainfall. Allow the lichen to dry completely between wetting cycles to prevent issues, as it absorbs water directly from the environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cyphelium is a genus of crustose areolate lichens with cup-like apothecia filled with sooty black spores. The genus is in the family Caliciaceae . The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in north and south temperate regions, and contains about 12 species. Members of the genus are commonly called soot lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen thrives in cool, humid conditions with clean air, typical of old-growth temperate and boreal forests. Provide bright indirect light and ensure high ambient humidity with regular misting, allowing the thallus to dry completely between wetting cycles. Fertilizers are detrimental and should be avoided.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air and rainwater. External fertilizers are harmful and should be avoided.
