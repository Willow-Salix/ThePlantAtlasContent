## Care Guide
American mannagrass is a wetland grass requiring consistently wet to saturated soil, ideally with full sun to partial shade. It thrives in rich, organic soil and can tolerate periods of standing water, making it suitable for bog gardens or pond margins.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from nutrient-rich, organic soils. Supplemental fertilizer can be provided sparingly, especially if grown in less ideal conditions, but is generally not a heavy feeder in its native rich, wetland soils.
