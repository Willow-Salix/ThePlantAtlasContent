## Care Guide
Bristly Wolfstail thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native arid and semi-arid environments. Provide minimal, infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and generally does not require fertilization.
