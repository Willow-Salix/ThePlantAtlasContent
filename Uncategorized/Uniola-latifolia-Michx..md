## Care Guide
River Oats thrive in partial shade to full sun with consistently moist soil, mimicking their native woodland and floodplain habitats. Minimal fertilization is needed; focus on providing adequate moisture and appropriate light conditions for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, especially in poor soils.
