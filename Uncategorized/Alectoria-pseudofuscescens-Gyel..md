## Care Guide
This lichen requires a cool, humid environment with consistent moisture from the air, replicating its native boreal and subalpine forest habitat. Provide partial shade to indirect bright light and avoid any traditional fertilizers, which can be harmful.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and rain. Traditional fertilizers are detrimental and can cause harm.
