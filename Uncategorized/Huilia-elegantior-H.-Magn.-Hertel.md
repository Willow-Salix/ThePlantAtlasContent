## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Scandinavia, Greenland, Alaska, and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago; often at high altitudes. |
| **Climate** | Arctic/Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure; typically found on exposed rocks, tolerating strong direct light and high UV radiation common in high-latitude/altitude environments. |
| **Watering** | Intermittent moisture from atmospheric sources like rain, fog, dew, and melting snow; adapted to periods of desiccation between moisture events. |

## Introduction
Porpidia is a genus of crustose lichens in the family Lecideaceae. Porpidia species primarily inhabit siliceous rocks, pebbles, and stonework, with rare occurrences on bark, wood, and compacted soil. The thallus, or body of the lichen, varies in appearance from thick and crusty to barely visible. It may form a continuous layer or develop cracks resulting in a segmented, areolate structure. The colour of the thallus ranges from grey and white to orange.

## Care Guide
Huilia elegantior is an arctic-alpine lichen thriving in harsh, exposed environments on siliceous rocks. It requires high sun exposure and obtains moisture intermittently from precipitation and atmospheric humidity, tolerating dry periods. Traditional fertilization is unnecessary, as it absorbs nutrients from its surroundings.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed; obtains nutrients directly from atmospheric deposition and the mineral substrate (siliceous rocks).
