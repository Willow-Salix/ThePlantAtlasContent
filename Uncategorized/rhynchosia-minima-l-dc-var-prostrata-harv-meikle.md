## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical Africa, particularly Southern and East Africa (e.g., South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical/Subtropical Savanna and Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in environments with high light exposure, typical of open grasslands and savannas. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Mimic seasonal rainfall patterns by reducing water during dormant periods or cooler months, as it is relatively drought-tolerant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rhynchosia, also known as snoutbean, is a genus of plants in the family Fabaceae. It includes 260 species of herbs, vines, and subshrubs native to tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions around the world, ranging from the southern United States to northern Argentina in the Americas, and through Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, southern Asia from Iran to Korea and Japan, New Guinea, and Australia. Typical habitats include seasonally-dry forest, forest margins, woodland, thicket, wooded grassland, shrubland, and grassland, often in open rocky areas, disturbed areas, or along streams.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable legume thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its native African savanna environment. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and has low fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overwatering to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A balanced, diluted fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season.
