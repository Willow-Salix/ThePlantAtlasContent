## Introduction
Rock tripe is the common name for various lichens of the genus Umbilicaria that grow on rocks. They are widely distributed, including on bare rock in Antarctica, and throughout northern parts of North America such as New England and the Rocky Mountains. They are edible when properly prepared; soaking extensively and boiling with changes of water removes the bitterness and purgative properties. They have been used as a famine food in extreme cases when other food sources were unavailable, as by early American northern explorers.
Umbilicaria esculenta is commonly used as a food in Asian cuisine and a restorative medicine in traditional Chinese medicine.

## Care Guide
To care for Lynge's Navel Lichen, provide high, direct light and cold temperatures, mimicking its arctic-alpine habitat. Offer infrequent but complete hydration, ensuring it dries out thoroughly between watering, and avoid any fertilization as it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens are highly adapted to nutrient-poor environments and can be harmed by external nutrient application.
