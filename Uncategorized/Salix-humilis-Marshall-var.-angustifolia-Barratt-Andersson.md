## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America, including Eastern Canada and the Eastern to Midwestern United States. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest and Grassland, often associated with moist-mesic to dry-mesic open areas, edges, and disturbed sites. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. It thrives in open environments with ample light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is preferred, especially during establishment. While tolerant of some dry periods, regular watering to maintain moist, but not waterlogged, soil is ideal. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This willow thrives in full to partial sun with consistently moist soil, mimicking its native habitat in temperate North American prairies and open woodlands. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, and provide average soil fertility for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Generally not a heavy feeder. Average soil fertility is sufficient; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if growth appears sluggish.
