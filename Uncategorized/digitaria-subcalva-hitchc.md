## 🌱 Overview
Digitaria is a genus of plants in the grass family native to tropical and warm temperate regions but can occur in tropical, subtropical, and cooler temperate regions as well. Common names include crabgrass, finger-grass, and fonio. They are slender monocotyledonous annual and perennial lawn, pasture, and forage plants; some are often considered lawn pests. Digitus is the Latin word for "finger", and they are distinguished by the long, finger-like inflorescences they produce.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient grassland plant thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry between sessions. It is quite drought-tolerant once established, and benefits from a low to moderate fertilization during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
