## Care Guide
Belladonna thrives in conditions similar to its native temperate woodlands, preferring partial to full shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Protect it from intense direct sunlight and ensure regular watering, particularly during its active growth period, while providing moderate nutrients through rich soil or light fertilization.

### Fertilizer
