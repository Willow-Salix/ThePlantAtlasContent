## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and central North America, spanning from southeastern North Dakota east to Maine and southern Quebec, south to northern Florida, and west to southeastern Texas and Oklahoma. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. While it can tolerate some shade, it thrives and grows best with ample sunlight, reflecting its ability to grow in forest clearings or as an emergent canopy tree. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist, but not waterlogged, soil, particularly during dry periods. This mimics the moderate to high rainfall patterns of its native temperate forest habitat. |

## Care Guide
Slippery Elm thrives in temperate environments, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, rich, well-drained soil. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, and provide moderate fertilization if the soil is not naturally fertile to encourage healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization, especially in less fertile soils, as it naturally prefers rich, well-drained loamy soils. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can support robust growth.
