## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal forests of North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Boreal Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Dappled to moderate indirect light. It thrives in well-lit, yet shaded, situations typically found on tree bark within a forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent high humidity and regular moisture from misting or natural rainfall, with periods of drying between moistenings. Does not require watering in the traditional sense, as it absorbs water directly. |

## Introduction
Bacidia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. These lichens are characterised by their crustose growth form, distinctive club-shaped reproductive structures called apothecia that contain long, needle-like spores, and their symbiotic partnership with green algae. Bacidia species typically grow on various substrates including tree bark, rock surfaces, and occasionally soil, and are distinguished from related genera by their specific spore characteristics and internal structures.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in humid, well-ventilated environments with dappled to moderate indirect light, mimicking its forest habitat. Ensure consistent moisture through regular misting or high ambient humidity, allowing for brief periods of drying. Traditional fertilizers are not required and should be avoided.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens derive all necessary nutrients from the air and rainfall; conventional fertilizers designed for vascular plants are unnecessary and potentially harmful.
