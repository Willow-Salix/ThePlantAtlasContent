## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and subarctic regions, including Canada, Alaska, Greenland, Northern Europe, and high alpine areas of temperate mountain ranges (e.g., Rocky Mountains, European Alps). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in exposed, bright conditions. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimic the moisture from snowmelt and regular precipitation during its growing season, avoiding waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in cool, exposed conditions with full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It requires minimal fertilization and protection from intense heat in warmer climates, preferring a gritty, rocky growing medium.

### Fertilizer
Low. Native soils are typically lean, so minimal fertilization is needed. Over-fertilizing can lead to weak, leggy growth.
