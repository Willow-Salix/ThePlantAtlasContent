## Care Guide
This pantropical plant, originating from the Americas, thrives in warm, sunny conditions with consistent moisture, especially during its active growth. It is quite adaptable, tolerating various soil types and brief dry spells. Provide ample light and regular watering for robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; as a pioneer species in disturbed areas, it's not highly demanding. A balanced liquid fertilizer applied monthly during the growing season is sufficient.
