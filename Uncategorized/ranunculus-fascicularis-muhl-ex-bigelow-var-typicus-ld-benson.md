## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and Central North America, ranging from Ontario south to Florida, and west to Texas and Minnesota. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest and Grassland margins, often found in open woods, prairies, and rocky slopes with distinct seasons, cold winters, and moderate to warm summers. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial shade. As an early spring bloomer, it often receives more direct sunlight before the full canopy of deciduous trees develops. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, but well-draining soil, particularly during its active growth and flowering period in spring. Tolerates drier conditions during summer dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ranunculus  is a large genus of about 1750 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Members of the genus are known as buttercups, spearworts and water crowfoots.
The genus is distributed worldwide, primarily in temperate and montane regions. The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, which has extremely tough and tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much taller meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris. In ornamental  gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.
Buttercups usually flower in the spring, but flowers may be found throughout the summer, especially where the plants are growing as opportunistic colonizers, as in the case of garden weeds.
The water crowfoots (Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium), which grow in still or running water, are sometimes treated in a separate genus Batrachium (from Greek βάτραχος bátrakhos, "frog"). They have two different leaf types, thread-like leaves underwater and broader floating leaves. In some species, such as R. aquatilis, a third, intermediate leaf type occurs.
Ranunculus species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Hebrew character and small angle shades. Some species are popular ornamental flowers in horticulture, with many cultivars selected for large and brightly coloured flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Early Buttercup thrives in temperate conditions with full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil, particularly in spring. Provide light fertilization during its growing season and allow for drier conditions during summer dormancy.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from light fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in early spring as new growth emerges. Avoid over-fertilization.
