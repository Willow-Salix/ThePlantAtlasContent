## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin (Southern Europe, North Africa, Western Asia, Macaronesia) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean climate (mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, consistent with its habitat in open grasslands and disturbed areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growing season from fall through spring, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Tolerant of drier conditions as it approaches summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## Care Guide
Bird Clover prefers full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its native Mediterranean environment. Provide consistent moisture during its growing period from fall to spring, and expect it to tolerate drier conditions in summer. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, fertilizer needs are generally low.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, reducing the need for external nitrogen fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer might be beneficial in very poor soils during active growth.
