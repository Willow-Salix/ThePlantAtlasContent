## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern Europe, Western and Central Asia (e.g., Turkey, Caucasus, Iran, Afghanistan, Central Asian republics) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Steppe / Semi-arid Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), typical of open grasslands with no significant canopy cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Low watering frequency. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its native dry season adaptation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Secale is a genus of the grass tribe Triticeae, which is related to barley (Hordeum) and wheat (Triticum). The genus includes cultivated species such as rye (Secale cereale) as well as weedy and wild rye species. The best-known species of the genus is the cultivated rye, S. cereale, which is grown as a grain and forage crop. Wild and weedy rye species help provide a huge gene pool that can be used for improvement of the cultivated rye.
The genus Secale includes the cultivated rye and four to eleven wild species depending on the species criteria used. Commonly recognized species of the genus are the annuals, S. cereale, S. vavilovii Grouch, and S. sylvestre and perennial S. strictum (syn. S. montanum). Secale cereale includes cultivated rye and other weedy rye types. Secale strictum is a group that includes distinct geographical isolates. Secale vavilovii is the most different of the genus as it separated early from the other species in the genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Eastern Wild Rye is a hardy, drought-tolerant grass that thrives in full sun conditions. Reflecting its steppe origins, it requires infrequent watering, allowing soil to dry out between applications, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in moderately fertile to poor, well-draining soils, and does not require heavy fertilization. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer is usually sufficient, or less if in the ground.
