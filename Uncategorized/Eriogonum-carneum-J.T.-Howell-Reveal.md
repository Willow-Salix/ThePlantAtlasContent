## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | White Mountains of California (Mono and Inyo counties, USA) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Desert / Subalpine Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), thrives in intense high-elevation sun exposure. |
| **Watering** | Low to very low. Highly drought-tolerant once established; water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Excellent drainage is critical. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
Eriogonum carneum requires full sun and exceptionally well-draining soil, mimicking its native high-elevation alpine desert habitat. Water very sparingly once established, as it is highly drought-tolerant and prone to rot with excessive moisture. Fertilization is generally not needed.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. This plant is adapted to lean, rocky, and nutrient-poor soils; rich fertilizers should be avoided.
