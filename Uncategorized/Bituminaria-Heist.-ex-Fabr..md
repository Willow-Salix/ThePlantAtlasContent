| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, ideally receiving at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. |
| **Watering** | Water regularly during active growth (spring to early summer), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal to no supplemental water during dry summer months. |

## Care Guide
Bituminaria thrives in conditions mimicking its Mediterranean origin, requiring full sun and well-drained soil. It is very drought-tolerant once established, needing regular water only during its active growth period in spring. As a nitrogen-fixer, it has low fertilizer requirements.

### Fertilizer
Low. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, Bituminaria enriches the soil and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial if soil is very poor.
