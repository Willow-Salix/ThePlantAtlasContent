## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Virginia to Texas), West Indies, Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical to Tropical Wetlands and Savannas |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, brightly lit environments typical of its wetland and savanna habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native habitat in ditches, pond margins, and wet flatwoods. Tolerates standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This beaksedge thrives in consistently wet to saturated soil conditions under full to partial sun. It prefers low-nutrient environments, so fertilizing should be minimal to avoid over-enrichment. The key is to replicate its native humid, wetland habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Typically found in nutrient-poor, acidic soils characteristic of savannas and wet flatwoods. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer.
