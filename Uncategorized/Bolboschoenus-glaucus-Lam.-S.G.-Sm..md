## Care Guide
Tuberous bulrush is a wetland species that thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet to submerged soil conditions, mimicking its native habitat. It benefits from a nutrient-rich substrate but does not demand frequent heavy fertilization. Ensure a permanent water source for optimal health and growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in nutrient-rich, organic-laden substrates typical of wetlands, but does not require frequent heavy fertilization.
