## Introduction
Sparganium (bur-reed) is a genus of flowering plants, described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753. It is widespread in  wet areas in temperate regions of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The plants are perennial marsh plants that can grow to 3.5 m (depending on the species), with epicene flowers.
It was previously placed alone in the family Sparganiaceae. Sparganium is closely related to the Typhaceae and the APG III system (2009) includes Sparganium in that family. It has been determined from phylogenetic analysis to be the closest living relative of the genus Typha (cat-tail).

## Care Guide
The Green-fruited Bur-reed thrives in consistently wet to submerged conditions, ideally in full sun to partial shade, mimicking its native wetland habitat. It requires a mucky, organic-rich substrate and cannot tolerate dry periods. Once established, it is a low-maintenance aquatic plant with minimal fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility. Thrives in organic-rich, mucky soils; supplemental fertilization is rarely needed for established plants.
