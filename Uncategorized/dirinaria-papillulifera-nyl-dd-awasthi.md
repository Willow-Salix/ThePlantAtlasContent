## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Pantropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia (e.g., India, Philippines), the Americas (e.g., Brazil, USA - Florida), and Oceania (e.g., New Zealand) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Humid Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to dappled shade. It prefers filtered light typical of a forest understory or canopy edge, avoiding direct, intense sun which can be too harsh. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and frequent wetting from rain, dew, or mist. It absorbs moisture directly from the air and does not have roots for traditional watering from soil. Good air circulation is also important. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dirinaria papillulifera thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, mimicking its tropical forest origins. It needs frequent atmospheric moisture through misting or rain and does not require traditional watering or fertilizer. Ensure good air circulation to maintain optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens are very sensitive to nutrient overload and obtain essential trace elements and minerals from rainwater, dust, and their substrate (bark or rock).
