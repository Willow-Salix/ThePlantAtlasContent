## Care Guide
Chilean Clover is a resilient plant thriving in full sun and moderate water during its growing season. Its nitrogen-fixing capabilities make it low-maintenance regarding soil fertility, making it ideal for naturalized settings or as a cover crop. Ensure good drainage and allow for seasonal adjustments in watering.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. Supplemental fertilization is rarely necessary, but if growth is poor, a low-nitrogen, high-phosphorous fertilizer can be applied.
