# Orthodontium Moss

*Orthodontium pellucens (Hook.) Bruch & Schimp.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | New Zealand, Australia (southeastern regions, e.g., Tasmania, Victoria), and southern South America (e.g., Chile, Argentina) |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate Forest / Cool Temperate Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to dappled light; thrives in deep shade or indirect light. Avoid any direct sunlight which can scorch the delicate fronds. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist conditions and high ambient humidity. Water frequently to keep the substrate damp but not waterlogged. Misting regularly or placing in a humid environment (like a terrarium) is highly beneficial. |

## Care Guide
Orthodontium moss thrives in a cool, humid environment with consistent moisture and very low light. Mimicking its native temperate rainforest habitat, ensure it's kept damp, receives high humidity, and is shielded from direct sun. Fertilization should be minimal, as its nutrient requirements are very low.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs. If fertilizing, use an extremely diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/8 to 1/10 strength) very infrequently (once or twice a year at most).
