## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Baja California (Mexico), Southern California (USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Sonoran Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full, direct sun for at least 6-8 hours daily to mimic its open desert habitat. Protect from extreme, prolonged summer afternoon sun in very hot climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Very infrequent and deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought tolerant; overwatering is detrimental, especially during dormancy. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a desert plant, the California Barrel Cactus demands full sun exposure and extremely infrequent watering, allowing its soil to thoroughly dry out. Provide excellent drainage and minimal fertilization to replicate its arid native conditions and prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. If fertilizing, use a balanced, low-nitrogen cactus-specific fertilizer diluted to half strength, once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer).
