## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar and circumboreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Rocky Mountains), Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Alps), and Asia (e.g., Siberia, Himalayas). Also found in high-altitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Andes, New Zealand). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, and high-elevation Boreal Forest. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun exposure, especially in cooler climates or during its short growing season in native habitats. Can tolerate partial sun, particularly in warmer regions where some afternoon shade might be beneficial. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering, preferring consistently moist but well-drained soil during the active growing period. Its native environments often have moisture from snowmelt or rain, but also good drainage. Avoid waterlogged conditions; tolerates short dry spells once established. Reduce watering significantly during dormancy. |

## Introduction
Trisetum is a genus of plants in the grass family, widespread in temperate, subarctic, and alpine habitats in much of the world. Oatgrass is a common name for plants in this genus.

## Care Guide
Spike Trisetum is an exceptionally hardy grass thriving in cold, high-altitude, or arctic conditions. It requires full sun and well-drained, lean soils with moderate moisture during its active growth phase. To maintain its robust, compact form, avoid overly rich soils and excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils characteristic of its native alpine and arctic habitats. Excessive fertilization should be avoided as it can promote weak, leggy growth. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer application in spring, if any, is sufficient.
