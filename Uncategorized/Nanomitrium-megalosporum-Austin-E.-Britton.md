## Care Guide
This ephemeral moss thrives in consistently moist, well-draining substrate under indirect light or partial shade. It requires high humidity and minimal fertilization, completing its life cycle quickly during favorable wet periods.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Minimal to no fertilization, as mosses have low nutrient demands. Use a highly diluted, specialized moss fertilizer if desired, very sparingly.
