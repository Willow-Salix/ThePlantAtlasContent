## Care Guide
The Oneflower Fringed Gentian thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil, replicating its native montane wetland habitat. It requires frequent watering to prevent drying out and benefits from minimal to no fertilization in moderately fertile conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is generally required. If soil is very poor, a light application of a balanced, low-phosphorus fertilizer can be used sparingly.
