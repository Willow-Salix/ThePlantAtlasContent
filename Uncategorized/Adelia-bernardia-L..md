## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Greater Antilles (Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Jamaica), Central America, Mexico, and potentially southern Florida. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest, Subtropical Dry Forest, or coastal thickets, often on limestone-rich soils. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, thriving in open, exposed conditions characteristic of dry scrublands and forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Tolerates periods of drought due to its native dry forest habitat but benefits from moderate, regular watering when the topsoil is dry, ensuring excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Adelia is a genus of flowering plants in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, subfamily Acalyphoideae. It is native to Latin America and the Caribbean, with one species extending northward into the southernmost part of Texas.
The name is derived from the Greek words α (a), meaning "not", and δήλος (delos), meaning "visible." It refers to the difficulties Linnaeus experienced interpreting the genus.

## Care Guide
Bernard's Adelia thrives in sunny locations with well-draining soil, reflecting its native dry forest and thicket environments. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and fertilize sparingly as it is adapted to lower nutrient conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; it is adapted to nutrient-poor, often limestone-derived soils, so heavy feeding is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
