## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Ohio Hawthorn is a resilient temperate tree that prefers full sun exposure to thrive and fruit best. It requires moderate watering, particularly when young, but becomes more tolerant of dry spells once established. Fertilization is generally minimal, benefiting from a spring application in less fertile soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not a heavy feeder. Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in early spring, especially in nutrient-poor soils or to encourage growth.
