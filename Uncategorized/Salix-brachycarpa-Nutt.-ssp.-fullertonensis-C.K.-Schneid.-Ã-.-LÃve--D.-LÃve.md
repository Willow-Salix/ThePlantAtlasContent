## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America, specifically high elevations in California (e.g., White Mountains, southern Sierra Nevada) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine/Montane Wetland, characterized by wet meadows, streambanks, and alkaline seeps |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, as it naturally grows in open, exposed montane meadows and riparian areas. |
| **Watering** | High and consistent moisture; thrives in constantly wet or saturated soils, tolerating 'wet feet' due to its native streambank and seep habitats. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This willow thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently wet soil, making it suitable for boggy areas or perpetually moist environments. It tolerates alkaline conditions and benefits from moderate fertilization to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, as it is adapted to the nutrient levels found in montane riparian zones and alkaline soils, not requiring excessively rich fertilization.
