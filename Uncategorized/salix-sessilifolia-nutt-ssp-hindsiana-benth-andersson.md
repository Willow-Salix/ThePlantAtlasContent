## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hinds' Willow thrives in full sun and consistently wet to moist soil, mirroring its riparian origins. It requires abundant water and benefits from moderate fertility to support its vigorous growth, making it suitable for waterside planting.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from fertile, well-draining soil but does not typically require heavy fertilization. A balanced fertilizer in spring is adequate if growth is poor.
