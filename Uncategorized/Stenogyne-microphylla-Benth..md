## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (endemic), specifically Maui, Moloka'i, and Lāna'i |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to filtered light, protected from direct harsh sun, mimicking the understory of a dense forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil, but not waterlogged. Water frequently, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, consistent with high rainfall and humidity but good drainage in its native habitat. |
