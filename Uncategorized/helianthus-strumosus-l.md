## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and central North America, including eastern Canada and the central and eastern United States. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Woodlands and Prairies |
| **☀️ Light** | Thrives in full sun to partial shade. In its native woodland habitat, it often grows in clearings, along forest edges, or in areas with dappled sunlight, tolerating several hours of direct sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate watering to establish. Once mature, it is quite drought-tolerant, adapting to periods of lower rainfall common in temperate prairies, but performs best with consistent moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Helianthus () is a genus comprising around 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the daisy family Asteraceae commonly known as sunflowers. Except for three South American species, the species of Helianthus are native to North America and Central America. The best-known species is the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus). This and other species, notably Jerusalem artichoke (H. tuberosus), are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions, as food crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants. The species H. annuus typically grows during the summer and into early fall, with the peak growth season being mid-summer.
Several perennial Helianthus species are grown in gardens, but have a tendency to spread rapidly and can become aggressive.  On the other hand, the whorled sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus, was listed as an endangered species in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule protecting it under the Endangered Species Act. The primary threats to this species are industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. They grow to 1.8 metres (6 feet) and are primarily found in woodlands, adjacent to creeks and moist, prairie-like areas.
The common sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine, cultivated there for several centuries.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Paleleaf Woodland Sunflower is a resilient plant native to temperate regions, thriving in full sun to partial shade and adapting to varying soil conditions. It requires moderate water, especially when young, but becomes drought-tolerant once established, and generally needs minimal fertilization for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is needed as it is adapted to average to poor soils. Over-fertilizing can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering. If soils are very poor, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial.
