## Care Guide
Fries' Dimple Lichen thrives in consistently high humidity and low to moderate, indirect light, mimicking its native old-growth forest understory habitat. It requires clean air and should never be fertilized in the traditional sense, relying on environmental moisture and air for sustenance.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens do not require traditional fertilization; they derive nutrients from the air and moisture. Sensitive to air pollution.
