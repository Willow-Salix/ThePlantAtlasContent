## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia, Alabama) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Warm-Temperate Pine Flatwoods and Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry completely between applications; drought-tolerant once established due to well-draining sandy native soils. |

## Introduction
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## Care Guide
Hairy Jointweed is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and requires well-drained, sandy soils, mimicking its native scrubland habitat. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization to ensure optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils.
