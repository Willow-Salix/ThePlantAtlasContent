## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caribbean Islands, specifically the Greater Antilles (Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Cuba, Jamaica) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Subtropical Humid Forest (Understory) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can scorch its delicate leaves, preferring filtered light or dappled shade. |

## Introduction
Oxalis ( (British English) or  (American English)) is a large genus of flowering plants in the wood-sorrel family, Oxalidaceae, comprising over 550 species. The genus occurs throughout most of the world, except for the polar areas; species diversity is particularly rich in tropical Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.
Many of the species are known as wood-sorrels (also as wood sorrels or woodsorrels) as they have an acidic taste reminiscent of the sorrel proper (Rumex acetosa), which is not closely related. Some species are called yellow sorrels or pink sorrels after the colour of their flowers instead. Other species are colloquially known as false shamrocks, and some called sourgrasses. For the genus as a whole, the term oxalises is also used.

## Care Guide
Eggers' Woodsorrel thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical forest understory. Provide consistent moisture, partial to full shade, and moderate to high humidity. Feed lightly during the active growing season to support lush foliage and healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer), typically once every 4-6 weeks.
