## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (coastal plain from North Carolina to Florida and west to Louisiana) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland/Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for best flowering, mimicking its open woodland and savanna habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil but is somewhat drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its native sandy soils and moderate rainfall. |

## Introduction
Chrysopsis (golden asters) are plants in the family Asteraceae native to the southern and eastern United States. All the species are found in Florida, although some are found in other states as well.
These are annual and perennial herbs bearing daisy-like flower heads with yellow disc florets and usually yellow ray florets. Some species formerly classified in this genus are now included in other genera: Heterotheca, Pityopsis, Stenotus, Ionactis, Aster, Eucephalus, Erigeron, Machaeranthera, Croptilon, Xanthisma, Oclemena, Bradburia, Oxypappus, Arnica, and Helichrysopsis.
Golden asters are often used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Schinia petulans (which feeds exclusively on C. subulata).

## Care Guide
This Golden Aster requires full sun and well-draining, sandy soil, mirroring its native pine woodlands. Provide moderate, consistent watering and minimal fertilization to support its robust growth and abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from a light application of balanced granular fertilizer in early spring, as its native sandy soils are not typically rich in nutrients.
