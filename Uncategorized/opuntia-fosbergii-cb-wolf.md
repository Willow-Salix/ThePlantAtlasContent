## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mojave Desert, California, USA (specifically Cady and Marble Mountains, San Bernardino County) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; requires bright, direct light for optimal growth, mimicking its native open desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, deep watering. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Extremely drought tolerant, as it's adapted to very low rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Opuntia phaeacantha is a species of prickly pear cactus known by the common names brown-spine prickly pear, tulip prickly pear, and desert prickly pear, which is found across the southwestern United States, lower Great Plains, and northern Mexico. The plant forms dense but localized thickets. Several varieties of this particular species occur, and it may hybridize with other prickly pears, making identification sometimes tricky.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, preferring to dry out completely between waterings. Provide a well-draining soil and fertilize sparingly during its active growth period to mimic its arid, nutrient-poor natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Fertilize sparingly (once or twice during the growing season) with a balanced, low-nitrogen cactus-specific fertilizer, reflecting the nutrient-poor desert soils.
