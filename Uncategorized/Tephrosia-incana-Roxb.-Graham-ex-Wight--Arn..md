## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asian countries like Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Savanna / Monsoon Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. As it thrives in open grasslands and forest margins, it prefers plenty of direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the active growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering during dry or dormant periods, as it is somewhat drought-tolerant. |

## Introduction
Tephrosia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is widespread in both the Eastern and Western Hemisphere, where it is found in tropical and warm-temperate regions.
The generic name is derived from the Greek word τεφρος (tephros), meaning "ash-colored," referring to the greyish tint given to the leaves by their dense trichomes. Hoarypea is a common name for plants in this genus, along with goat's rue and devil's shoestring.

## Care Guide
Hoary Tephrosia thrives in full to partial sun with moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, reflecting its native tropical savanna climate. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires low to moderate fertilizer, primarily during its active growth phases.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Being a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires less supplemental nitrogen. A balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season, especially in nutrient-poor soils.
