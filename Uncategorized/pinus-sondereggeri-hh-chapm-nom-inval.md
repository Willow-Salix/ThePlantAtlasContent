# Sonderegger Pine
### *Pinus Ã—sondereggeri H.H. Chapm., nom. inval.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6-8+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its nature as a pioneer species in open forest environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is crucial for young plants. Established trees are moderately drought-tolerant but benefit from watering during prolonged dry periods, reflecting the seasonal rainfall patterns of its native habitat. Requires well-draining soil. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pinus × sondereggeri is the only named southern pine hybrid.  Its common names include Sonderegger pine and bastard pine.  It is a naturally occurring cross between loblolly pine (P. taeda) and longleaf pine (P. palustris). It was originally described by H. H. Chapman (1922), who named it after its discoverer, V. H. Sonderegger, a state forester of Louisiana.  This pine usually occurs singly or in small groups where both loblolly and longleaf pines overlap in range. Because both parental trees usually produce cones at the same time of year, no phenological barrier exists, thus the two freely cross.
Tree characteristics are normally intermediate between loblolly and longleaf.  Sonderegger pine is not resistant to fusiform rust like its parent, longleaf pine.  Because this hybrid pine possesses heavy limbs and long-needled foliage like the longleaf pine, one may confuse Sonderegger pine with longleaf pine. However, the striped brown bud of Sonderegger pine is a distinguishing characteristic, as longleaf possesses a white bud. Also, intermediate in size, the cone is armed similarly to a cone of the loblolly pine.  Because no grass stage exists for this hybrid, it has significant height growth during the first year. Thus, it is easily detected in uniform plantings of longleaf pine.
Also called "bastard pine", Sonderegger pine may have qualities superior to those of its parents. Differences in wood properties are insignificant when compared to random samples of the two parent species.  Tracheid length might be slightly shorter than either parent,  though tracheid length in southern pines usually does not differ significantly.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sonderegger Pine thrives in full sun and well-drained, acidic soil. Ensure consistent moisture for young trees, then water moderately once established, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize sparingly with a conifer-specific formula only if soil nutrients are deficient.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a slow-release, balanced fertilizer for conifers, especially in nutrient-poor, sandy soils typical of its native range. Avoid excessive fertilization.
