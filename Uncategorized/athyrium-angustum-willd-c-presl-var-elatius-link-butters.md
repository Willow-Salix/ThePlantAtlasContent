## 🌱 Overview
Athyrium (lady-fern) is a genus of about 180 species of terrestrial ferns, with a cosmopolitan distribution.  It is placed in the family Athyriaceae, in the order Polypodiales.
Its genus name is from Greek a- ('without') and Latinized Greek thyreos ('shield'), describing its inconspicuous indusium (sorus' covering).
The common name "lady fern" refers in particular to the common lady fern, Athyrium filix-femina.
Athyrium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the small angle shades and Sthenopis auratus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Northern Lady Fern flourishes in cool, shaded environments with consistently moist, well-drained soil, replicating its native temperate forest floor conditions. Provide regular watering and minimal fertilization to support its lush, delicate foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from light fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer or compost in early spring; avoid over-fertilizing which can burn roots.
