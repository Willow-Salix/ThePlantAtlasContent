## 🧤 Care Instructions
This specific lichen thrives in cool, clean, and bright environments, requiring high atmospheric humidity and occasional moisture. It is crucial to avoid any fertilization, as the lichen is self-sufficient and sensitive to external nutrients. Provide excellent air circulation and protect from excessive heat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens are highly self-sufficient, deriving nutrients from the air and substrate, and are extremely sensitive to external nutrients and pollutants.
