*Philoxerus R. Br.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions across tropical and subtropical areas worldwide, including Australia, Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Americas. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Coastal (e.g., beaches, dunes, salt marshes) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, consistent with its open coastal habitat. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, keeping soil consistently moist but well-draining. Tolerant of some drought once established, but thrives with consistent moisture. |

## Care Guide
Philoxerus thrives in full sun, reflecting its tropical and subtropical coastal origins. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil, though it can tolerate some drought once established. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its adaptation to often nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements, as its native sandy or saline soils are typically not nutrient-rich. Minimal light feeding during the growing season is sufficient if desired.
