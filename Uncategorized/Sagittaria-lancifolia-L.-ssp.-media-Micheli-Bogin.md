## Care Guide
This aquatic perennial thrives in consistently wet to submerged conditions, ideally with its roots in standing water, mimicking its native wetland habitat. It prefers full sun to partial shade and benefits from rich, mucky soil. Ensure constant moisture for optimal growth and health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to rich, mucky soil, benefiting from nutrient availability in its water-logged environment; minimal supplemental fertilization typically needed if grown in suitable soil.
