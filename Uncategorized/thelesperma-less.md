## 🧤 Care Instructions
Greenthread thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native arid grassland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, making it a low-maintenance plant suitable for xeriscaping. Avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires little to no fertilizer, as it is adapted to lean soils. If growth is poor, a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
