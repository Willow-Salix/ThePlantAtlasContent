## Care Guide
This plant thrives in constantly moist, acidic soil and requires ample sunlight, ranging from full sun to partial shade. Ensure consistent watering to prevent the soil from drying out, and provide only light fertilization during its active growth phase to mimic its native bog and savanna conditions.

### Fertilizer
Light; native soils are often nutrient-poor. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly during the growing season.
