## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its arid coastal origins. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established. Fertilization should be infrequent and light, as it is adapted to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; native to nutrient-poor soils, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient, or only when growth appears weak.
