## 🌱 Overview
Lepidium is a genus of plants in the mustard/cabbage family, Brassicaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. It includes familiar species such as garden cress, maca, and dittander. General common names include peppercress, peppergrass, pepperweed, and pepperwort.  Some species form tumbleweeds.
The genus name Lepidium is from Greek meaning 'small scale', which is thought to be derived from a folk medicine usage of the plant to treat leprosy, which cause small scales on the skin. Another meaning is related to the small scale-like fruit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pepperweed is a hardy plant that prefers full to partial sun exposure and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions. It is tolerant of average to poor soil conditions, requiring minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to disturbed habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Being adapted to disturbed and often nutrient-poor soils, heavy feeding is not typically necessary.
