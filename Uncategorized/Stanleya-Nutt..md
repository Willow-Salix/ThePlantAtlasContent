## Introduction
Stanleya is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae known commonly as prince's plumes. It includes seven species native to the western and central United States and northern Mexico. These are herbs or erect shrubs which bear dense, plumelike inflorescences of white to bright yellow flowers with long stamens. Stanleya species are native to the western United States. These plants are toxic because they concentrate selenium from the soil in their tissues.

## Care Guide
Princesplume thrives in full sun and well-draining, infertile soils, reflecting its native desert and scrubland habitat. It is extremely drought-tolerant, requiring very little water and no significant fertilization once established. Mimicking these arid conditions is crucial for its health and survival.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none, as it thrives in nutrient-poor, typically alkaline desert soils and can be harmed by excessive fertilization.
