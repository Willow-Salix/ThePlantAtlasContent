## Care Guide
Grimmia indianensis thrives in bright light conditions, mimicking its native rocky outcrops. It requires consistent moisture but tolerates brief dry spells, necessitating good drainage and often benefits from high humidity. As a moss, its nutrient needs are minimal, making fertilizer largely unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Minimal to no fertilization needed. If desired, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (once or twice a year at most).
