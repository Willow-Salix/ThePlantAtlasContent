## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its native open desert habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking sporadic desert rainfall. Overwatering will cause root rot. |

## Care Guide
Desert Rue is an extremely hardy plant adapted to arid environments, demanding full sun and very little water. It thrives in poor, well-draining soil and should rarely be fertilized. Mimic its desert origins for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Native desert soils are typically nutrient-poor, so supplemental feeding should be rare and very light, if at all.
