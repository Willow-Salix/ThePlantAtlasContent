## Care Guide
Provide full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native California chaparral. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and minimize or avoid fertilizer application to mimic its natural, nutrient-poor habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is required. It is adapted to lean, well-drained soils typical of chaparral environments.
