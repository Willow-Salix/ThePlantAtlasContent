## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Russia), Northern Asia, and North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska). |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate to Subarctic Grasslands and Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in areas with good light exposure, especially in cooler climates. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist soil; frequent watering is necessary to prevent drying out, mimicking its native damp meadow and wetland habitats. |

## Introduction
Hierochloe is a genus of plants in the grass family known generally as sweetgrass. These are perennial rhizomatous grasses found primarily in temperate and subarctic regions of Eurasia and North America, although some species extend southwards into Australia and Latin America.
These erect green grasses are known for their sweet scent. They bear panicle inflorescences with rounded grass grain fruits.
Some authors advocate merging the two genera Hierochloe and Anthoxanthum, though others disagree.

## Care Guide
Northern Sweetgrass thrives in cool to subarctic climates, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist soil. Its care should focus on maintaining adequate hydration, especially during warmer spells, and providing moderate nutrients to support its growth in a damp meadow-like environment.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertility; a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in spring or a diluted liquid feed during the growing season is generally sufficient. Avoid over-fertilizing.
