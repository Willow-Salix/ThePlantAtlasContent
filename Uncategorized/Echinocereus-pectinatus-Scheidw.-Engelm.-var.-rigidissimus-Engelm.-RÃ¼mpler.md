## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico) and Northern Mexico (Sonora, Chihuahua) |
| **Climate** | Arid Desert |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure, ideally full sun for at least 6-8 hours daily to thrive and encourage flowering. |
| **Watering** | Very low; highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during the active growing season (spring/summer). Reduce watering significantly or stop entirely in winter. |

## Introduction
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## Care Guide
This desert native requires abundant sunlight and infrequent watering to mimic its arid homeland. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent rot, and provide minimal fertilization during its growing period to maintain health and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low; these plants are adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted, balanced cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring to early summer).
