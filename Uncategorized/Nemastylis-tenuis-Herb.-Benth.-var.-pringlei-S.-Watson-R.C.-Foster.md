## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires well-drained soil, typical of its arid Mexican origins. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and use fertilizer minimally during its active growth period. Mimicking its native environment ensures its health and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to low; a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season, if at all.
