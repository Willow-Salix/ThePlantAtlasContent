## Care Guide
This tropical sedge thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist to wet soil, never allowing it to dry out, to mimic its native wetland habitats. Provide regular watering and moderate fertilization during active growth to support its robust nature.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, particularly in container settings; a balanced liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season would be beneficial.
