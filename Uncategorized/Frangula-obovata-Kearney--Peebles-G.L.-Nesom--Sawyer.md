## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Semi-Arid Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is ideal, reflecting its open and exposed native habitat. It can tolerate some partial shade, especially in the hottest parts of its range. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant once established, mirroring its adaptation to infrequent rainfall in desert and semi-arid regions. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Frangula is a genus of about 35 species of flowering shrubs or small trees, commonly known as alder buckthorn in the buckthorn family Rhamnaceae. The common name buckthorn is also used to describe species of the genus Rhamnus in the same family and also sea-buckthorn, Hippophae rhamnoides in the Elaeagnaceae.

## Care Guide
Arizona Buckthorn thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its arid and semi-arid native range. Once established, it requires infrequent, deep watering and is very drought-tolerant. Fertilization is rarely needed, as it is adapted to low-nutrient environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required. Its native soils are typically rocky and nutrient-poor, so it is adapted to lean conditions. If desired, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be given, but it is rarely necessary.
