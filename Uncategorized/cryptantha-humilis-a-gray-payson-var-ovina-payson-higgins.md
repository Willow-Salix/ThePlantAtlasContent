## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Great Basin region, including parts of Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Oregon, California, Wyoming) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lamb's Cryptantha requires full sun exposure and extremely well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid scrubland environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs infrequent watering, along with minimal to no fertilization, to thrive.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. It thrives in lean, poor soils. A very light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in early spring if growth is weak, but often not necessary.
