## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Andes Mountains of South America, Central America (e.g., Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Costa Rica, Panama) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Cloud Forest, Páramo |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. In high-altitude environments, it can tolerate more direct sun often filtered by clouds. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained. Mimic frequent rainfall and high humidity, ensuring good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Bejaria racemosa, commonly known as tarflower, is a woody shrub with a fragrant flower found in the southeastern US states of Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. It grows on flatlands in groups. Insects become trapped on its flowers due to the sticky secretions found there.

## Care Guide
Flyweed thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical montane cloud forest and páramo environments, requiring consistently moist, acidic, well-drained soil and high humidity. Provide bright, indirect to partial sunlight, and fertilize sparingly with an acidic formulation to encourage healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with an acidic, slow-release or diluted liquid fertilizer, particularly during the growing season. Sensitive to high salt buildup.
