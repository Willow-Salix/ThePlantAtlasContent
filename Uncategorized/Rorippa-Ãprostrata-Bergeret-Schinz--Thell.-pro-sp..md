## Care Guide
Prostrate Yellowcress thrives in bright conditions, from full sun to partial shade, and demands consistently moist to wet soil, replicating its native riverside habitats. Frequent watering is essential, as is avoiding any periods of drought. Moderate fertilization will support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility; benefits from an all-purpose balanced fertilizer during the active growing season.
