## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California (Sierra Nevada foothills, Southern Coast Ranges), USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland / Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers full sun for best growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring deep but infrequent watering only during prolonged dry periods. Avoid excessive watering and waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Ceanothus is a genus of about 50–60 species of nitrogen-fixing shrubs and small trees in the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae). Common names for members of this genus are buckbrush, California lilac, soap bush, or just ceanothus. "Ceanothus" comes from Ancient Greek: κεάνωθος (keánōthos), which was applied by Theophrastus (371–287 BC) to an Old World plant believed to be Cirsium arvense.
The genus is native to North America with the highest diversity on the western coast. Some species (e.g., C. americanus) are restricted to the eastern United States and southeast Canada, and others (e.g., C. caeruleus) extend as far south as Guatemala. Most are shrubs 0.5–3 metres (1.6–9.8 ft) tall, but C. arboreus and C. thyrsiflorus, both native to California, can be small multi-trunked trees up to 6–7 metres (20–23 ft) tall.

## Care Guide
Lemmon's ceanothus thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its native California chaparral. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing minimal water and virtually no fertilizer due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; thrives in lean, poor soils. As a nitrogen-fixer, it generally does not require nitrogen fertilizers and can be sensitive to high phosphorus levels.
