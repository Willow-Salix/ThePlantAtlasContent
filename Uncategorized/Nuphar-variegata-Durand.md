## Care Guide
This aquatic plant thrives when continuously submerged in full sun to partial shade, rooted in nutrient-rich substrate at the bottom of a pond or slow-moving water body. Maintain consistent water levels and ensure adequate nutrients within its aquatic environment to support robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in nutrient-rich muck or organic sediments at the bottom of water bodies; supplemental aquatic plant fertilizer may be beneficial in poor substrates.
