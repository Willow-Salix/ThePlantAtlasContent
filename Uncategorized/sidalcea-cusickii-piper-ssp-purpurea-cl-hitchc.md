## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Pacific Northwest of North America (Oregon and Washington, USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Meadowland / Open Woodland (Marine West Coast Climate) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it grows in open areas or the edge of woodlands, suggesting it can tolerate direct sun but might appreciate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture. Native to moist meadows and along streambanks, indicating a preference for consistently damp, but well-drained, soil. Regular watering is crucial, especially during dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate perennial thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring consistently moist but well-drained soil. Regular watering is key to its success, especially in warmer conditions, while it generally requires minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a meadow plant, it likely thrives in average garden soil and doesn't require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if soil is poor.
