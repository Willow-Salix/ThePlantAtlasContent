## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in temperate woodland conditions, preferring partial shade to full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Ensure regular watering and provide an annual boost of organic matter or a balanced fertilizer to mimic its native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from an annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring to support lush growth in its naturally rich woodland soil.
