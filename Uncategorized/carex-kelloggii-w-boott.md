## 🧤 Care Instructions
Kellogg's Sedge thrives in consistently wet or moist conditions, making it perfect for water gardens or boggy areas. It prefers full sun to partial shade and benefits from rich, organic soil, though it is not a heavy feeder. Ensure continuous access to water to mimic its native wetland habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It benefits from rich, organic soil but does not require heavy fertilization. A light annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer is generally sufficient.
