## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar high-latitude and high-altitude regions, including parts of North America (Alaska, Canada, Greenland), northern Europe (Norway, Sweden, Finland), and northern Asia (Siberia, Mongolia, Japan, Korea). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in open, high-light conditions typical of alpine meadows and bogs. |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to submerged; requires bog-like conditions or shallow standing water, mimicking its native habitat in wet meadows and stream edges. |

## Introduction
Hippuris, the mare's tail, was previously the sole genus in the family Hippuridaceae. Following genetic research by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, it has now been transferred to the family Plantaginaceae, with Hippuridaceae being reduced to a synonym of Plantaginaceae.
It includes one to three species depending on taxonomic interpretation. Some authorities only accept the first species of those listed below, treating the other two as synonyms of it:

Common mare's tail, Hippuris vulgaris
Mountain mare's tail, Hippuris montana
Fourleaf mare's tail, Hippuris tetraphylla
They are aquatic plants found in shallow ponds and streams, both slow-moving and fast-flowing. Hippuris, despite being a flowering plant, is sometimes mistakenly identified with the non-flowering plant horsetail.

## Care Guide
This semi-aquatic plant needs full to partial sun and constant moisture, ideally with its roots submerged in water or consistently wet soil. It is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor alpine conditions, meaning minimal fertilization is required. Mimic its native cool, wet, and bright environment for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils characteristic of bogs and alpine environments. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
