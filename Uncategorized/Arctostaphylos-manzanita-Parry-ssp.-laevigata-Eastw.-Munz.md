## Introduction
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## Care Guide
Contra Costa manzanita flourishes in full sun and well-draining, lean soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean chaparral habitat. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and should receive minimal to no summer irrigation to prevent root rot. Fertilizer is generally unnecessary and can be harmful due to its adaptation to low-nutrient environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils (often serpentine) and can be sensitive to high nutrient levels, especially phosphorus. Avoid rich potting mixes.
