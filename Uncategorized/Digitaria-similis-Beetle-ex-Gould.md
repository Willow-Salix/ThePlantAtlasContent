## Introduction
Digitaria is a genus of plants in the grass family native to tropical and warm temperate regions but can occur in tropical, subtropical, and cooler temperate regions as well. Common names include crabgrass, finger-grass, and fonio. They are slender monocotyledonous annual and perennial lawn, pasture, and forage plants; some are often considered lawn pests. Digitus is the Latin word for "finger", and they are distinguished by the long, finger-like inflorescences they produce.

## Care Guide
Roadside Crabgrass, native to the open grasslands of Eastern Australia, thrives in full sun conditions. It requires moderate watering, tolerating dry periods but growing most vigorously with consistent moisture. Nutrient needs are low to moderate, making it adaptable to various soil types without heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate (benefits from light, balanced fertilization during active growth, especially if soil is poor)
