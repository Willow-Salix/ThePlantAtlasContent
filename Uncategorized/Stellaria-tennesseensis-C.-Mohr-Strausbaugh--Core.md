## Care Guide
This plant thrives in partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native glade and woodland habitats. It requires moderate watering to maintain soil moisture and benefits from light, occasional fertilization rather than heavy feeding for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced fertilizer or compost application in spring is generally sufficient. Avoid over-fertilizing.
