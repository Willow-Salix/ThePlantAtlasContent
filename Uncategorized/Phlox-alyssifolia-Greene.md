## 🧤 Care Instructions
Alyssumleaf Phlox is a resilient perennial best suited for sunny, well-drained locations that mimic its native arid environments. It requires minimal watering once established and prefers lean soil, making it an excellent choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in lean to moderately fertile soil. Excessive fertilization can lead to weak, leggy growth; a very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be applied but is often not necessary.
