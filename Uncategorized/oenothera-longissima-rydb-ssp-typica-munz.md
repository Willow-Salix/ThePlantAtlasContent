## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |

| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (specifically Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland, High Desert, Montane Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. Thrives in direct, unfiltered sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily, typical of its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Low. Extremely drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking sporadic rainfall in arid environments. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and dry conditions, indicative of its arid and high-desert native climate. Provide well-draining soil and water sparingly once established, allowing for drought periods. Minimal fertilization is needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adaptable to lean soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer once in spring, or none at all if soil is moderately fertile, is sufficient.
