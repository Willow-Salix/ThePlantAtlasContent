## Introduction
The genus Platanthera belongs to the subfamily Orchidoideae of the family Orchidaceae, and comprises about 150 species of orchids. The members of this genus, known as the butterfly orchids or fringed orchids, were previously included in the genus Orchis, which is a close relative (along with the genus Habenaria). They are distributed throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are terrestrial and have tubercules. The genomes of Platanthera zijinensis and Platanthera guangdongensis have been sequenced as model species to study partial and full mycoheterotrophy.

## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its native moist montane forests, requiring bright indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. High humidity and moderate temperatures are crucial, with sparse feeding during active growth to support its unique needs.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize every 2-4 weeks during active growth with a highly diluted (1/4 to 1/2 strength) balanced orchid fertilizer; reduce or cease during dormancy.
