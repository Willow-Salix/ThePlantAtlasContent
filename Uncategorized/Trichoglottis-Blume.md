## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and New Guinea. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Subtropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light, mimicking the dappled light found under a rainforest canopy. Avoid direct, harsh sunlight which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Frequent watering, often daily during active growth, allowing the roots to dry slightly between waterings. High humidity (70-80%) is crucial, especially for epiphytic species. |

## Introduction
Trichoglottis, commonly known as cherub orchids or 毛舌兰属 (mao she lan shu), is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. Orchids in this genus are epiphytic plants with thick roots, relatively thick, fibrous stems and many large, thick, leathery leaves arranged in two ranks. The flowers are usually small and yellowish with light brown or purple markings. The flowers have broad sepals, narrower petals and a labellum which has three lobes and is often hairy. There are about 85 species distributed from tropical and subtropical Asia to the north-western Pacific. Most species grow in rainforest.

## Care Guide
Trichoglottis orchids thrive in conditions mimicking their native tropical rainforests, requiring consistent bright, indirect light and high humidity. Water frequently, ensuring roots dry slightly between applications, and provide dilute fertilizer during growth. This strategy supports their epiphytic nature and promotes healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is preferred; use a balanced orchid fertilizer at one-quarter to one-half strength every 2-3 waterings during the growing season.
