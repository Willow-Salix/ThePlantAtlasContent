## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, extending eastward to parts of Asia (e.g., Iran, India, China) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (hot, dry summers; mild, wet winters) and semi-arid subtropical regions |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. Requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive and produce abundant blooms. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established, but benefits from regular watering during hot, dry periods. Allow the top soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce frequency in cooler months. |

## Introduction
Nerium oleander ( NEER-ee-əm), commonly known as oleander or rosebay, is a shrub or small tree cultivated worldwide in temperate and subtropical areas as an ornamental and landscaping plant. It is the only species currently classified in the genus Nerium, belonging to subfamily Apocynoideae of the dogbane family Apocynaceae. It is so widely cultivated that no precise region of origin has been identified, though it is usually associated with the Mediterranean Basin.
Nerium grows to 2–6 metres (7–20 feet) tall. It is most commonly grown in its natural shrub form, but can be trained into a small tree with a single trunk. It is tolerant to both drought and inundation, but not to prolonged frost. White, pink or red five-lobed flowers grow in clusters year-round, peaking during the summer. The fruit is a long narrow pair of follicles, which splits open at maturity to release numerous downy seeds.
Nerium is a poisonous plant but its bitterness renders it unpalatable to humans and most animals, so poisoning cases are rare and the general risk for human mortality is low. Ingestion of larger amounts may cause nausea, vomiting, excess salivation, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea and irregular heart rhythm. Prolonged contact with sap may cause skin irritation, eye inflammation and dermatitis.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established, mirroring its Mediterranean origins. Provide regular watering during dry spells, allowing soil to dry between waterings, and fertilize lightly in spring for best blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in early spring is sufficient to promote vigorous growth and flowering. Avoid excessive nitrogen.
