## 🌱 Overview
Allamanda cathartica, commonly called golden trumpet, common trumpetvine, and yellow allamanda, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to Bolivia, Brazil, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela, and widely naturalised elsewhere in the tropics. This plant is cited in Flora Brasiliensis by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius.
It does not twine, nor does it have tendrils or aerial roots. It can be pruned into a shrub form. If not pruned it can sprawl to a height of 6 m (20 ft). According to McMullen, it can be up to 15 m (49 ft) in length in the Galapagos Islands where it is naturalised.

The city of Canóvanas, Puerto Rico has adopted this species, known locally as canario amarillo, as its official flower.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, Golden Trumpet requires abundant direct sunlight and consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its tropical rainforest origins. Regular fertilization during the growing season supports its vigorous growth and prolific blooming in warm conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Regular feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring through fall) due to its vigorous growth and heavy flowering in nutrient-rich but often leached tropical soils.
