## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar regions, including Arctic, Subarctic, and high-altitude mountainous areas globally (e.g., Alps, Rockies, Scandinavia, Antarctica) |
| **Climate** | Alpine, Arctic, Subarctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High to full sun exposure, often direct and intense, as it typically grows on exposed rocks without significant canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Requires intermittent moisture from rain, snowmelt, or fog, followed by periods of desiccation. Allow to dry completely between thorough rehydration, mimicking natural rainfall cycles. |

## Introduction
Acarospora is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Acarosporaceae. Most species in the genus are crustose lichens that grow on rocks in open and arid places all over the world. They may look like a cobblestone road or cracked up old paint, and are commonly called cobblestone lichens or cracked lichens. They usually grow on rock (are "saxicolous"), but some grow on soil (terricolous) or on other lichens. Some species in the genus are fungi that live as parasites on other lichens (lichenicolous fungi). Acarospora is a widely distributed genus, with about 128 species according to a 2008 estimate.
Species in Acarospora may be shiny as if covered with a glossy varnish, or dull and powdery looking. They have a diverse range of colors, from the brilliant yellow bright cobblestone lichen, to the dark reddish-brown mountain cobblestone lichen, or they can appear tan, gray, or white, from a dusty-looking coating (pruina). They may grow in crustose forms like a warty surface (verrucose), like cracking-up old crust of paint (rimose), like a bunch of "islands" in a dry lake bed (areolate), like the flakes of cracking up paint are peeling up at the edges (sub-squamulous), or like the flakes are growing over others like scales (squamulous).

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cold, bright environments on exposed siliceous rocks. It requires high sun exposure and intermittent moisture, allowing complete drying between rehydration. Traditional fertilization should be avoided as it can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to none. Lichens absorb trace nutrients directly from the atmosphere and rock surface; traditional fertilizers are not necessary and can be harmful.
