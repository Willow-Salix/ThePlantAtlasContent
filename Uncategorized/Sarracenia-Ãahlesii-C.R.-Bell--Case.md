| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (microhabitat: Bog/Wet Savanna) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day is ideal). Requires bright, unfiltered light. |

## Introduction
Pitcher plants are  carnivorous plants that have modified leaves known as pitfall traps—prey-trapping mechanisms featuring a deep cavity filled with digestive liquid. The traps of what are considered to be "true" pitcher plants are formed by specialized leaves. The plants attract and drown the prey with nectar.

## Care Guide
This carnivorous plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native bog habitat, requiring copious amounts of direct sunlight and consistently wet, mineral-free soil. Avoid fertilizing the soil, as it derives nutrients from trapped insects. Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues.

### Fertilizer
No soil fertilization is needed or recommended. The plant obtains all necessary nutrients from the insects it catches. Fertilizing the soil can be detrimental to its health.
