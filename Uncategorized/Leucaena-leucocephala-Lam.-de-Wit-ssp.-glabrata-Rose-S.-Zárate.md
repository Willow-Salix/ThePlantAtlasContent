## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Mexico and Northern Central America (e.g., Yucatán Peninsula, Guatemala, Belize) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure is preferred, thriving in open, well-lit environments common to tropical dry forests and disturbed areas. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering during dry periods and thriving with ample water during the growing season. Allow soil to dry between waterings, mimicking natural wet and dry cycles. |

## Introduction
Leucaena leucocephala is a small fast-growing mimosoid tree native to southern Mexico and northern Central America (Belize and Guatemala). It is now naturalized throughout the tropics including parts of Asia.
Common names include white leadtree, white popinac, horse tamarind, ipil-ipil, koa haole, and tan-tan.
Leucaena leucocephala is used for a variety of purposes, such as fencing, soil fertility, firewood, fiber, and livestock fodder.

## Care Guide
This resilient tree thrives in full sun and is exceptionally drought-tolerant once established, benefiting from moderate watering during its active growth period. It requires minimal fertilization, as it enriches the soil through nitrogen fixation, making it adaptable to various soil types found in its native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen, improving soil fertility and thriving in poor soils without rich amendments.
