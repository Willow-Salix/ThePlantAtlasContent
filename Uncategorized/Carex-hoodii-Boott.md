| **Native Origin** | Western North America (mountainous regions of the western United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine Grasslands and Open Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers bright conditions, tolerating some afternoon shade in warmer climates. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist but well-draining soil, especially during active growth. Tolerant of some drought once established, allow topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Care Guide
Hood's sedge thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, showing tolerance for some drought once established. It requires low to moderate fertilization, preferring a light feeding in spring if needed. Mimicking its native montane habitat will ensure robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if soil is already rich.
