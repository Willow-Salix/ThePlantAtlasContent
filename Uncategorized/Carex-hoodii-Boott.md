## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hood's sedge thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, showing tolerance for some drought once established. It requires low to moderate fertilization, preferring a light feeding in spring if needed. Mimicking its native montane habitat will ensure robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if soil is already rich.
