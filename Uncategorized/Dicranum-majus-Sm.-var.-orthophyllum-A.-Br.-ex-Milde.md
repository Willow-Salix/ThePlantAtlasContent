## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate and boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate, indirect light. Thrives in dappled shade or filtered light, mimicking its forest floor habitat. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist conditions are essential; water frequently enough to keep the substrate damp but not waterlogged. High humidity is crucial. |

## Introduction
Dicranum is a genus of mosses, also called wind-blown mosses or fork mosses. 
These mosses form in densely packed clumps. Stems may fork, but do not branch. In general, upright stems will be single but packed together. Dicranum is distributed globally. In North America these are commonly found in Jack pine or Red pine stands.

## Care Guide
This moss requires a consistently moist, high-humidity environment with low to moderate indirect light, similar to its native temperate forest floor. Avoid direct sunlight and do not over-fertilize, as it extracts sufficient nutrients from its surroundings.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Mosses generally do not require supplemental fertilization. Excessive nutrients can be harmful.
