## Introduction
Spiranthes is a genus of orchids in the subfamily Orchidoideae. They are known commonly as ladies tresses, ladies'-tresses, or lady's tresses. The genus is distributed in the Americas, Eurasia, and Australia. The genus name Spiranthes is derived from the Greek speira ("coil") and anthos ("flower"), and was inspired by the spirally arranged inflorescence.

## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid thrives in consistently wet conditions characteristic of its native southeastern US marshes. Provide ample bright light to partial shade, ensuring the soil never dries out. It generally requires very little supplemental fertilization, favoring a lean, moist environment.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, dilute fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) during active growth; may not require much if grown in appropriate substrate.
