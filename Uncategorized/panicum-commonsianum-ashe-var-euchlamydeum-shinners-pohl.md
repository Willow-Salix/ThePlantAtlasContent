## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide this panicgrass with full to partial sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native sandy pine barrens. Water moderately, allowing some drying between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing as it is adapted to poorer soils. This resilient grass thrives with minimal intervention once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils and does not typically require heavy feeding.
