## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal waters of the Western Atlantic Ocean, including southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Texas), Bermuda, the Caribbean Sea, and down to Brazil. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Marine shallow subtidal and intertidal zones of tropical and subtropical regions. |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires very high light, akin to full sun exposure, as it grows submerged in shallow, clear waters. |
| **💧 Water** | Needs constant submergence in stable saline (saltwater) conditions; does not require 'watering' in the terrestrial sense but rather consistent water quality and appropriate salinity (e.g., 20-35 ppt). |

## 🌱 Overview
Halodule wrightii is an aquatic plant in the Cymodoceaceae family. It is referred to by the common names shoal grass or shoalweed, and is a plant species native to seacoasts of some of the warmer oceans of the world.
H. wrightii is an herb growing in salt-water marshes in intertidal regions, often submerged at high tide but emergent at low tide.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This marine seagrass thrives in very high light and warm, stable saline water. Ensure consistent water quality and provide adequate nutrients, particularly through the substrate, to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate to high nutrient levels in both the water column and the substrate, typical for a fast-growing seagrass, especially iron and other micronutrients.
