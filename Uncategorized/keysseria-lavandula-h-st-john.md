## 🧤 Care Instructions
Keysseria lavandula requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and bright, indirect light to partial sun, typical of its native Hawaiian montane bog environment. High humidity is crucial for its well-being. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted solution during its growing period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Avoid over-fertilization, as bog plants are often adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.
