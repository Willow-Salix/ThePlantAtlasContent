## Care Guide
Zornia leptophylla, native to the tropical savannas of South America, thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions to mimic its native wet and dry seasons. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally needs little to no additional fertilizer, preferring well-drained, moderately fertile soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; as a legume, it can fix its own nitrogen.
