## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Kaibab Plateau, Northern Arizona, USA |
| **Climate** | Montane Semi-Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure (6-8+ hours direct sunlight daily) to thrive, reflecting its open habitat in its native range. |
| **Watering** | Low. This plant is highly drought-tolerant. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings; infrequent and deep watering is preferred. |

## Introduction
Camissonia, sometimes commonly known as sun cup or sundrop, is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the evening primrose family Onagraceae. A total of 12 species are known, nearly all from western North America, especially in the California Floristic Province, but also one from South America. Previous circumscriptions of the genus had recognized up to 62 species before it was split among other closely related genera.
The flowers generally open at dawn and are yellow. They are usually cup-shaped, thus the common name.
Formerly included in Oenothera, the species of Camissonia are distinguished by having a club- or head-shaped stigma, instead of the 4-part-divided stigma of Oenothera or Clarkia.
Camissonia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia cupes and Schinia deserticola, both of which feed on C. claviformis, the latter exclusively.
The genus is named after the botanist Adelbert von Chamisso.

## Care Guide
The Kaibab Suncup thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, mimicking its native arid montane environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between applications. Avoid over-fertilization to maintain its natural vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low. Native soils in arid scrublands are typically lean. Fertilization is generally not required; if growth is poor, a very diluted, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once annually in spring.
