## Introduction
Amphibromus is a genus of grasses in the family Poaceae. Most are known as swamp wallaby grass. Most are endemic to Australia. One can also be found in New Zealand and there are two species in South America.
These are annual or perennial grasses. Some can have cleistogamous inflorescences sheathed on their stems. The open inflorescences may be spreading or spikelike. These may have some cleistogamous spikelets in them, as well.
Most species occur in moist to wet habitat types. Some tolerate periodic flooding well, even flowering in response to it.

## Care Guide
This native Australian grass thrives in consistently moist to wet soil conditions, preferring full sun exposure. It's crucial to prevent the soil from drying out, especially during warmer periods. A light application of balanced fertilizer during its growing season will support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a low to moderate balanced liquid fertilizer during its active growing season to support robust growth, particularly if the soil is poor.
