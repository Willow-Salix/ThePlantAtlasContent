| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical regions of Central and South America, including the West Indies, Mexico, and parts of Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest (humid, shaded forest understory) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light; avoid direct sunlight which can scorch leaves. Mimics the dappled light of a forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but never soggy. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. High humidity is crucial, mimicking its tropical habitat. |

## Care Guide
Gloxinia thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest understory: bright, indirect light, consistently moist soil, and high humidity. Avoid direct sun and ensure good drainage to prevent root rot. Feed regularly during its growth period for optimal blooms.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength.
