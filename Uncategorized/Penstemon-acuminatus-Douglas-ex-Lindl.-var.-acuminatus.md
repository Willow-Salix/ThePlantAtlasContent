## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including the Great Plains and Intermountain West of the United States (e.g., Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Oregon, Washington) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Steppe / Semi-arid Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its native open, exposed habitats like prairies and sagebrush steppes. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate watering. Prefers well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, especially in established plants. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
Sharpleaf Penstemon thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established due to its semi-arid native climate. Avoid over-watering and heavy fertilization, as it prefers lean conditions. This plant is a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny garden spots.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soils. Over-fertilization can harm the plant. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in very poor soils, but often isn't necessary.
