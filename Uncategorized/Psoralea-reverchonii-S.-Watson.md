| **Native Origin** | South-Central United States (primarily Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflecting its native open prairie and dry woodland habitats. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry out between waterings. Avoid consistently wet conditions. |

## Introduction
Psoralea is a genus in the legume family (Fabaceae) with 121 species of shrubs, trees, and herbs native to southern and eastern Africa, ranging from Kenya to South Africa. In South Africa they are commonly referred to as fountainbush (English); fonteinbos, bloukeur, or penwortel (Afrikaans); and umHlonishwa (Zulu).

## Care Guide
Reverchon's Scurfpea thrives on neglect, requiring full sun and well-drained, lean soil to mimic its native dry grassland environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs minimal watering once established. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. Rich soils can promote leaf growth over flowers; lean, well-draining soil is preferred.
