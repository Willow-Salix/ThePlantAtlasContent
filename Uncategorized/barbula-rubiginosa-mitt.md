## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss requires a cool, humid environment with low to medium indirect light, mimicking its native habitat on shaded rocks and forest floors. Maintain a consistently moist substrate without waterlogging, and ensure high ambient humidity, potentially through misting or a terrarium. Fertilization is not necessary and can be harmful.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses do not require fertilization. Excess nutrients can be detrimental, as they primarily absorb elements from their substrate, water, and air.
