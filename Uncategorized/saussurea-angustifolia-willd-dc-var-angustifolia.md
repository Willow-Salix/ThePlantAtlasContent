## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Siberia, Northern Europe (e.g., Fennoscandia), Russian Far East, Mongolia, Northeast China, often in subarctic and alpine regions. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Subalpine Meadows, Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers high light intensity, especially during its growing season, typical of open alpine and subarctic landscapes. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Thrives in consistently moist but well-drained soil, mimicking the conditions of alpine meadows with snowmelt and summer rains. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Saussurea is a genus of about 300 species of flowering plants in the tribe Cardueae within the family Asteraceae, native to cool temperate and arctic regions of East Asia, Europe, and North America, with the highest diversity in alpine habitats in the Himalayas and East Asia. Common names include saw-wort and snow lotus, the latter used for a number of high altitude species in East Asia.
They are perennial herbaceous plants, ranging in height from dwarf alpine species 5–10 cm (2–4 in) tall, to tall thistle-like plants up to 3 m (9.8 ft) tall. The leaves are produced in a dense basal rosette, and then spirally up the flowering stem. The flowers form in a dense head of small capitula, often surrounded by dense white to purple woolly hairs; the individual florets are also white to purple. The wool is densest in the high altitude species, and aids in the thermoregulation of the flowers, minimising frost damage at night and also preventing ultraviolet light damage from the intense high-altitude sunlight.
De Candolle named the genus after Horace-Bénédict de Saussure (1740–1799) and Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure (1767–1845).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine species requires full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil to mimic its native subarctic and alpine environments. Keep fertilization light and ensure good air circulation to promote healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season should suffice, as native alpine soils are often nutrient-poor but have some organic matter.
