## 🌱 Overview
Satureja is a genus of aromatic plants of the family Lamiaceae, related to rosemary and thyme. It is native to southern and southeastern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. Historically, Satureja was defined broadly and many species of the subtribe Menthinae from throughout the world were included in it. In the modern cladistic era of botany, Satureja was redefined to a narrower monophyletic genus whose species are all native to Eurasia. Several species are cultivated as culinary herbs called savory, and they have become established in the wild in a few places.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dentate Savory prefers full to partial sun and well-draining, sandy soil, mimicking its native pine flatwoods habitat. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry slightly between applications, and use fertilizer sparingly as it is adapted to leaner conditions. This plant thrives in warm, humid subtropical environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs; adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly if needed.
