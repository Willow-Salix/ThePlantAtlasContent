## 🧤 Care Instructions
Crumia moss thrives in cool, humid environments reminiscent of its native temperate forest floor. Provide consistent moisture, high humidity, and partial to full shade, avoiding direct sunlight. Fertilization is rarely necessary, as these plants have minimal nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; mosses generally require minimal to no fertilization. If desired, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly once or twice a year.
