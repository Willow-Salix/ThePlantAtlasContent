## Introduction
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## Care Guide
Apiculate Bryum Moss thrives in consistently moist, well-drained environments with partial shade to bright indirect light. It has very low nutrient requirements, making fertilization largely unnecessary. Maintaining high humidity and consistent substrate dampness are key to its successful growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs; fertilization is generally unnecessary. If attempting, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly.
