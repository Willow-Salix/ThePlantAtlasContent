## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and very well-draining, often rocky or sandy, soil, reflecting its native arid scrubland habitat. Provide infrequent watering and avoid over-fertilizing, as it is highly drought-tolerant and a nitrogen-fixer.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required; as a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen.
