## Introduction
Melica is a genus of perennial grasses known generally as melic or melic grass. They are found in most temperate regions of the world.

Melic grasses are clumping to short-rhizomatous grasses. They have flowering culms up to 250 cm (98 in) tall bearing spikelets of papery flowers. The spikelets have between one and seven fertile flowers with a rudimentary structure at the distal end composed of one to four sterile florets. Some species of melic have corms, lending them the name oniongrass.
The genus is most diverse in South America and temperate Asia. Eight species are endemic to China. In North America, most species occur west of the Mississippi River, with exceptions being Melica mutica and M. nitens which occur throughout much of the southeast and lower Midwest respectively.

## Care Guide
Smith's melicgrass thrives in its native temperate forest and subalpine environments. It requires dappled sunlight to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil, tolerating brief dry spells once established. Fertilize sparingly, as too much can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring is sufficient, or none if soil is naturally rich.
