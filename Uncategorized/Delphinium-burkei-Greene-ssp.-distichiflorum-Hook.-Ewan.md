## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern California and Southern Oregon, USA |
| **Climate** | Temperate Subalpine Meadow and Open Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, appreciating some afternoon shade in hotter climates or full sun in cooler, high-altitude regions. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial during its active growth period in spring and early summer; prefers moist, well-drained soil and can tolerate somewhat drier conditions as it approaches dormancy in late summer. |

## Introduction
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## Care Guide
Burke's Larkspur (ssp. distichiflorum) thrives in conditions mimicking its native subalpine meadows and open forest habitats of Northern California and Southern Oregon. It prefers full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during its spring and early summer growth period. Fertilize lightly in spring with a balanced formula or compost to support robust flowering.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or a top-dressing of compost in early spring is generally sufficient to support healthy growth and flowering.
