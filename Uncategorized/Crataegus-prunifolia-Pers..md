## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest and Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun for optimal flowering and fruiting, but tolerates light to partial shade, though flowering may be reduced. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate and consistent moisture, especially when young. Once established, it is quite drought-tolerant but benefits from occasional deep watering during prolonged dry periods. |

## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
This hardy temperate tree thrives in full sun with moderate, consistent moisture, being adaptable to various well-drained soil types. It is low-maintenance, requiring minimal fertilization once established, making it a robust garden choice.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer can be applied in early spring for young trees or in very poor soil conditions; otherwise, it is generally not required.
