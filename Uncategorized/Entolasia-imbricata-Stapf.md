## Care Guide
This tropical African grass thrives in full to partial sun, reflecting its savanna and grassland origins. It requires moderate watering during its active growth periods but can withstand significant dry spells once established. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced feed to support healthy growth without excess.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, primarily during the growing season, using a balanced all-purpose fertilizer. Avoid over-fertilizing as it's adapted to less rich soils.
