## 🧤 Care Instructions
Yukon Wheatgrass is a hardy subarctic plant that thrives in full sun conditions. It requires moderate watering during its active growth period but can tolerate drier spells once established. Due to its adaptation to cooler, often less fertile environments, it has low to moderate fertilization needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, especially if soil nutrients are poor.
