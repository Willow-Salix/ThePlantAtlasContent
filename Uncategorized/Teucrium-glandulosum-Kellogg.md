## 🌱 Overview
Teucrium is a cosmopolitan genus of flowering plants in the mint family Lamiaceae, commonly known as germanders. Plants in this genus are perennial herbs or shrubs, with branches that are more or less square in cross-section, leaves arranged in opposite pairs, and flowers arranged in thyrses, the corolla with mostly white to cream-coloured, lobed petals.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sticky Germander thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean climate. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring regular watering during its active growth in cooler months and minimal to no water during hot, dry summers. Fertilizer needs are generally low.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to nutrient-poor soils; an annual light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary.
