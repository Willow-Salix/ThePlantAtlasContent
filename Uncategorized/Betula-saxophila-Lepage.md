## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America, particularly northeastern regions and subalpine areas, often on rocky slopes. |
| **Climate** | Subalpine to Boreal, characterized by cool temperatures, good snow cover, and often well-drained but moist rocky soils. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, especially in cooler climates. Prefers open, exposed sites common in rocky habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to high, consistent moisture, particularly in the growing season. Requires excellent drainage due to rocky native habitat, but does not tolerate prolonged drought. |

## Introduction
A birch is a thin-leaved deciduous hardwood tree of the genus Betula (), in the family Betulaceae, which also includes alders, hazels, and hornbeams. It is closely related to the beech-oak family Fagaceae. The genus Betula contains 30 to 60 known taxa of which 11 are on the IUCN 2011 Red List of Threatened Species. They are typically short-lived pioneer species and are widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in northern areas of temperate climates and in boreal climates. Birch wood is used for a wide range of purposes.

## Care Guide
This rock-loving birch, likely originating from cool, subalpine North American regions, thrives in full sun with consistently moist yet very well-drained soil. It is adapted to lean, rocky conditions and does not require heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to naturally lean, rocky soils. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
