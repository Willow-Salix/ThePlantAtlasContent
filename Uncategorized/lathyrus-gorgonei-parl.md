## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Gorgonean Pea is a Mediterranean annual thriving in full sun and moderate watering during its spring growing season. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires minimal nitrogen fertilization. Ensure well-drained soil and reduce water as the plant naturally senesces in drier summer conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a member of the Fabaceae family, it can fix atmospheric nitrogen. Therefore, it has low nitrogen requirements. A balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer or the addition of compost can support overall health, especially in poorer soils.
