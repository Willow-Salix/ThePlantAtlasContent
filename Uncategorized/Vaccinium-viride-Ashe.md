| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers ample light for best fruit production but can tolerate some afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate and consistent watering; requires moist but well-drained soil, mimicking the consistent rainfall of its native temperate forests. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Vaccinium  vack-SIN-ee-əm is a common and widespread genus of shrubs or dwarf shrubs in the heath family (Ericaceae). The fruits of many species are eaten by humans and some are of commercial importance, including the cranberry, blueberry, bilberry (whortleberry), lingonberry (cowberry), and huckleberry. Like many other heath plants, they are restricted to acidic soils.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Appalachian Blueberry thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained, and highly acidic soil. Provide moderate watering and light fertilization with an acid-specific formula to mimic its native temperate woodland conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with an acid-specific fertilizer (pH 4.5-5.5) during the growing season. Its native soils are often acidic and not overly rich.
