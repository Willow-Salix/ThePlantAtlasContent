| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah) |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The California Evening Primrose is a resilient desert native perfectly suited for arid conditions. It flourishes in full sun with well-drained, lean soils, requiring very little water and no supplemental fertilization once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; thrives in poor to average soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental, as its native desert soils are generally nutrient-poor.
