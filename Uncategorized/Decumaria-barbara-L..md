## Introduction
Decumaria barbara, commonly called climbing hydrangea or woodvamp, is a species plant in the Hydrangea family. It is native to southeastern United States, where it is widespread. Its typical natural habitat is wet bottomland forest, although it is also found in rich mesic forests in the Appalachian Mountains.
Decumaria barbara is a high-climbing woody vine that clings to trees with hairy aerial roots. It has adventitious roots and glossy, opposite leaves. It produces small white flowers in late spring and early summer.
The only other member of this genus is Decumaria sinensis, of central China.

## Care Guide
Woodvamp thrives in conditions similar to its native humid, temperate forests of the southeastern U.S. It requires partial to full shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide regular watering and moderate fertilization during the growing season to encourage healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season with a balanced, slow-release formula to support its growth in naturally rich forest soils.
