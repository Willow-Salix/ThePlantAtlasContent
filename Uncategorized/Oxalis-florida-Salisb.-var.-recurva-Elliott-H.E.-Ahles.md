## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (widespread across much of the eastern and central United States, particularly the southeastern United States, and parts of Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Woodland Edge (found in open woodlands, fields, disturbed areas) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade (prefers at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight, but can tolerate some afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates). |
| **Watering** | Moderate; prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch, allowing it to dry slightly between waterings but avoiding prolonged drought or waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Oxalis ( (British English) or  (American English)) is a large genus of flowering plants in the wood-sorrel family, Oxalidaceae, comprising over 550 species. The genus occurs throughout most of the world, except for the polar areas; species diversity is particularly rich in tropical Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.
Many of the species are known as wood-sorrels (also as wood sorrels or woodsorrels) as they have an acidic taste reminiscent of the sorrel proper (Rumex acetosa), which is not closely related. Some species are called yellow sorrels or pink sorrels after the colour of their flowers instead. Other species are colloquially known as false shamrocks, and some called sourgrasses. For the genus as a whole, the term oxalises is also used.

## Care Guide
Thriving in temperate North America, this woodsorrel prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is a relatively low-maintenance plant, not requiring heavy fertilization, and adapts well to various common garden conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; as a species often found in varied soil conditions and sometimes considered a weed, it is not a heavy feeder. A light application of balanced liquid fertilizer (diluted to half strength) once a month during the active growing season (spring/summer) is generally sufficient, or often not needed if soil is reasonably fertile.
