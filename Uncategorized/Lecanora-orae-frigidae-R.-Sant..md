## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Scandinavia, Greenland, Iceland, and Arctic Canada. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra / Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect to full sun exposure, mimicking the open, exposed conditions of its native high-latitude or high-altitude environments. Tolerates long periods of daylight during summer. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent access to moisture from high atmospheric humidity, fog, or occasional rainfall; direct watering is not typically needed as lichens absorb water from the air and surface. |

## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions with high atmospheric moisture, typical of tundra environments. It requires no traditional watering or soil nutrients, instead relying on air and substrate for hydration and minerals.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to no fertilizer needed; lichens obtain nutrients primarily from the atmosphere, rainwater, and the minerals on their substrate.
