## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mountainous regions of Western North America (Western United States and parts of Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Montane Bog |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. Avoid harsh, direct afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet; the growing medium should never be allowed to dry out, mimicking its bog habitat. |

## Introduction
The genus Platanthera belongs to the subfamily Orchidoideae of the family Orchidaceae, and comprises about 150 species of orchids. The members of this genus, known as the butterfly orchids or fringed orchids, were previously included in the genus Orchis, which is a close relative (along with the genus Habenaria). They are distributed throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are terrestrial and have tubercules. The genomes of Platanthera zijinensis and Platanthera guangdongensis have been sequenced as model species to study partial and full mycoheterotrophy.

## Care Guide
This bog orchid requires consistently moist to wet conditions, replicating its native montane bog environment. Provide bright, indirect light to partial sun and ensure the growing medium never dries out. Fertilization should be minimal, using a very dilute solution during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Low nutrient needs. If fertilizing, use a very weak, balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/8 to 1/4 strength) sparingly during the active growing season.
