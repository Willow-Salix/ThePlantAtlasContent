## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
To care for the Yellow Heartleaf Willow, replicate its native riparian environment by providing consistently moist to wet soil and plenty of sunlight. It requires ample water and benefits from regular fertilization during its active growth period to support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high; benefits from a balanced fertilizer during the growing season, especially in nutrient-poor soils.
