## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (including parts of Canada and the United States, from Quebec to Manitoba south to Florida and Texas) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade. Thrives in the dappled light conditions found under a forest canopy, especially preferring protection from intense afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained. Mimic its native habitat in moist woods and near stream banks, ensuring regular watering, particularly during dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Nodding Fescue thrives in the cool, moist, and shaded conditions typical of temperate deciduous forests. It requires consistent soil moisture and prefers partial to full shade, flourishing in organically rich soil with minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant benefits from rich, organic soil but does not require heavy fertilization. An annual application of organic compost or a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient.
