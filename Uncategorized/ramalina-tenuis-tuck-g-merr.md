## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Coastal Temperate (often with Mediterranean influences or high fog frequency) |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun, tolerating periods of direct exposure common in coastal environments, especially when accompanied by high humidity or fog. |
| **💧 Water** | Primarily absorbs moisture from high atmospheric humidity, fog, and rain. Requires frequent misting or a consistently humid environment; does not have roots and should not be watered like a traditional plant. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cartilage lichen thrives in environments mimicking its native coastal habitat, requiring consistently high atmospheric humidity, frequent misting, and good air circulation. Provide bright indirect light to partial sun, and absolutely no traditional soil-based fertilizers, as it absorbs nutrients directly from the air and water.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from airborne particles, dissolved minerals in rainwater, and dust. Chemical fertilizers can be harmful.
