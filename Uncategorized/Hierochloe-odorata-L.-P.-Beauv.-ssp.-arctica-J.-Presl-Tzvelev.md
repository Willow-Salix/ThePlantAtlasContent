## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Subarctic regions, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Northern Europe (Scandinavia), and Siberia |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Subarctic Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in open, exposed areas with long daylight hours during the growing season. |
| **Watering** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil, tolerating waterlogged conditions similar to its native boggy or poorly drained environments. Does not tolerate drying out. |

## Introduction
Hierochloe is a genus of plants in the grass family known generally as sweetgrass. These are perennial rhizomatous grasses found primarily in temperate and subarctic regions of Eurasia and North America, although some species extend southwards into Australia and Latin America.
These erect green grasses are known for their sweet scent. They bear panicle inflorescences with rounded grass grain fruits.
Some authors advocate merging the two genera Hierochloe and Anthoxanthum, though others disagree.

## Care Guide
Arctic Sweetgrass thrives in cool, consistently moist to wet conditions and can tolerate full sun during its active growing season. It requires nutrient-poor soil and will not tolerate drought, mimicking its native arctic and subarctic wetland environments.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor tundra soils. Minimal to no fertilization is needed; if applied, use a very dilute solution sparingly.
