## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pohlia moss thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, mimicking its native habitat. Ensure consistent moisture and high humidity, avoiding direct sunlight. Fertilization should be minimal, as these plants have very low nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses are sensitive to high nutrient concentrations; light fertilization (if any) with specialized moss food or diluted general fertilizer is sufficient.
