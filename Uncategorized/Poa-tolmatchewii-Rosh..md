## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic regions, including Alaska, Yukon (Canada), and parts of Arctic Russia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun during its short, active growing season, accustomed to long daylight hours. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist during the active growing season, mimicking melting snow and wet tundra conditions. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot during dormancy or in non-tundra settings. Water very sparingly during its cold dormant period. |

## Introduction
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, full sun conditions, requiring consistently moist soil during its short summer growing period. It is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, so fertilizer should be minimal. Ensure excellent drainage and allow for a cold, dormant period with very little water.

### Fertilizer
Low. Use a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly once or twice during the active growing season, or none at all, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.
