## Introduction
Ipomoea () is the largest genus in the plant family Convolvulaceae, with over 600 species. It is a large and diverse group, with common names including morning glory, water convolvulus or water spinach, sweet potato, bindweed, moonflower, etc. The genus occurs throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and comprises annual and perennial herbaceous plants, lianas, shrubs, and small trees; most of the species are twining climbing plants.
Their most widespread common name is morning glory, but some species in related genera bear that same common name and some Ipomoea species are known by different common names. Those formerly separated in Calonyction (Greek καλός kalós "good" and νύξ, νυκτός núx, nuktós, "night") are called moonflowers. The name Ipomoea is derived from the Ancient Greek ἴψ, meaning 'woodworm', and ὅμοιος (hómoios), meaning "resembling". It refers to their twining habit.

## Care Guide
This vigorous tropical vine thrives in full sun and warm conditions. Provide consistent moisture during its growing season and use a balanced fertilizer periodically to encourage prolific flowering. Ensure good drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding. Apply a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
