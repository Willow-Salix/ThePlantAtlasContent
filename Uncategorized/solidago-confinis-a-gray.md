## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pinewoods Goldenrod thrives in conditions mimicking its native Southern California and Baja California Mediterranean shrubland habitat. It requires full to partial sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing minimal watering. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it prefers lean to moderately fertile soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; generally not required. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils found in its native habitat and excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
