## Care Guide
Originating from tropical and subtropical regions, the climbing milkvine thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright indirect to partial sun. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from regular, diluted fertilization during its active growth period. Protect it from intense direct afternoon sun and cold temperatures.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength monthly during the growing season (spring/summer).
