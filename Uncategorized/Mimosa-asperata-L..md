| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in environments with ample light exposure, typical of disturbed open areas, riverbanks, and forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, reflecting its native habitat along wetland margins and riverbanks. Avoid allowing the soil to dry out completely, especially during warm growing periods. |

## Introduction
Mimosa is a genus of about 600 species of herbs and shrubs, in the mimosoid clade of the legume family Fabaceae. Species are native to the Americas, from North Dakota to northern Argentina, and to eastern Africa (Tanzania, Mozambique, and Madagascar) as well as the Indian subcontinent and Indochina. The generic name is derived from the Greek word μῖμος (mimos), 'actor' or 'mime', and the feminine suffix -osa, 'resembling', suggesting its 'sensitive leaves' which seem to 'mimic conscious life'.
Two species in the genus are especially notable. One is Mimosa pudica, commonly known as touch-me-not, which folds its leaves when touched or exposed to heat. It is native to southern Central and South America but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value, both as a houseplant in temperate areas, and outdoors in the tropics. Outdoor cultivation has led to weedy invasion in some areas, notably Hawaii. The other is Mimosa tenuiflora, which is best known for its use in shamanic ayahuasca brews due to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine found in its root bark.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and demands consistently moist soil, reflecting its tropical wetland-edge origins. Provide moderate fertility and ensure it does not experience prolonged drought, which it is not adapted to.

### Fertilizer
As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen. Benefits from moderate fertility; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season is sufficient.
