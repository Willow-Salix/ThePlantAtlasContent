## 🌱 Overview
Stipa is a genus of about 140 species of large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and  spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to Stipa, which have since been reclassified into new genera.
Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as Stipa brachytricha, S. arundinacea, S. splendens, S. gigantea and S. pulchra are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.
It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stipa Dregeana thrives in environments mimicking its native South African montane grasslands, requiring full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide moderate fertilization during the active growing season to support its vigorous growth, ensuring it's not waterlogged but also not allowed to dry out completely for extended periods.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
