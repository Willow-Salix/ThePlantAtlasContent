## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (coastal plains from New Jersey south to Florida and west to Louisiana) and parts of the Caribbean (e.g., Cuba). |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Bogs and Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate full sun if humidity and moisture are consistently high. |
| **Watering** | Constantly moist to wet. Requires high humidity. Use distilled, rainwater, or deionized water to avoid mineral buildup. |

## Introduction
Sphagnum is a genus of approximately 380 accepted species of mosses, commonly known as sphagnum moss, also bog moss and quacker moss (although that term is also sometimes used for peat). Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16 to 26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions.
As Sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. Thus, Sphagnum can influence the composition of such habitats, with some describing Sphagnum as 'habitat manipulators' or 'autogenic ecosystem engineers'. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants.
Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions.
Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, and any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.

## Care Guide
Austin's Sphagnum thrives in consistently saturated, acidic conditions with high humidity, mimicking its native bog environment. It needs bright indirect to partial sun and must be watered with pure water to prevent mineral toxicity. No fertilizer should be applied.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed. Extremely sensitive to mineral salts and nutrient concentrations found in tap water and standard fertilizers.
