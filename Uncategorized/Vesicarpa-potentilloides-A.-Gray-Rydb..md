## Care Guide
False Chicken-Sage is a robust, drought-tolerant perennial suited for arid and semi-arid conditions. It demands full sun exposure and well-draining soil, thriving with infrequent watering and minimal fertilization to mimic its native montane habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean to moderately fertile soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release formula in spring, especially in very poor soils.
