## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sasak's Snow Lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light, mimicking its native sub-alpine habitat. Provide consistent moisture through frequent misting or high ambient humidity, and avoid any direct fertilization due to its sensitivity to nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilization and is highly sensitive to high nutrient concentrations; receives trace nutrients from the air and precipitation.
