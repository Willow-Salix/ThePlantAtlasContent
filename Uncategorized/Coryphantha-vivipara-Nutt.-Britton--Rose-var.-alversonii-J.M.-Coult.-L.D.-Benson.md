## Introduction
Coryphantha (from Greek, "flowering on the top"), or beehive cactus, is a genus of small to middle-sized, globose or columnar cacti. The genus is native to arid parts of Central America, Mexico, through Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas and north into southwestern, central, and southeastern Montana. With its two subgenera, 57 species and 20 subspecies, it is one of the largest genera of cactus.

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. Use a well-draining cactus mix and fertilize sparingly during its active growth period to mimic its arid native environment.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Apply a diluted, balanced cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer).
