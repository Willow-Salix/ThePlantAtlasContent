## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | High sun; requires abundant full sunlight, at least 6-8 hours daily, to thrive and flower. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and deep watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking desert rainfall patterns. Reduce watering significantly in winter. |

## Introduction
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## Care Guide
The Scarlet Hedgehog Cactus thrives in conditions mirroring its native arid desert habitat. Provide abundant full sun and infrequent, thorough watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. Fertilize sparingly during the growing season for optimal health and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low; apply a balanced, diluted fertilizer (e.g., 5-10-5 or 10-10-10) once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
