## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern North America, specifically eastern Canada (e.g., Newfoundland, Quebec) and northeastern United States (e.g., Maine, New Hampshire). |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate to Subarctic Coastal Barrens |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in exposed, open coastal areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It thrives in well-drained conditions and is susceptible to root rot in waterlogged soil, reflecting its rocky, often dry native habitats. |

## Introduction
Oxytropis is a genus of plants in the legume family. It includes over 600 species native to subarctic to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. It is one of three genera of plants known as locoweeds, and are notorious for being toxic to grazing animals. The other locoweed genus is the closely related Astragalus. Most oxtropis species are native to Eurasia and North America, but several species are native to the Arctic. These are hairy perennial plants which produce raceme inflorescences of pink, purple, white, or yellow flowers which are generally pea-like but have distinctive sharply beaked keels. The stems are leafless, the leaves being all basal. The plant produces legume pods containing the seeds.

## Care Guide
Provide full sun and excellent drainage, mimicking its native exposed coastal barrens. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and avoid rich fertilizers as it is adapted to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required. As a member of the legume family, it can fix its own nitrogen. Native soils in barrens are typically nutrient-poor, so heavy fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
