## Care Guide
This moss thrives in perpetually wet, often submerged or saturated, environments with cool to moderate temperatures. It requires medium to high light exposure and very minimal nutrient input, replicating its native boreal and arctic fen conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Its natural habitat is typically nutrient-poor; high levels of fertilization can be detrimental to its health.
