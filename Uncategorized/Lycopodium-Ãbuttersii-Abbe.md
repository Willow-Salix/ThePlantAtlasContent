## Introduction
Lycopodium (from Ancient Greek lykos, wolf and podion, diminutive of pous, foot) is a genus of clubmosses, also known as ground pines or creeping cedars, in the family Lycopodiaceae. Two very different circumscriptions of the genus are in use. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Lycopodium is one of nine genera in the subfamily Lycopodioideae, and has from nine to 15 species. In other classifications, the genus is equivalent to the whole of the subfamily, since it includes all of the other genera. More than 40 species are accepted.

## Care Guide
Butters' Clubmoss thrives in conditions mimicking its native open woodland habitat. Provide partial sun to partial shade and ensure the soil is well-draining, allowing it to dry out between moderate waterings. It has low fertilizer needs, adapting well to nutrient-poor, acidic soils.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
