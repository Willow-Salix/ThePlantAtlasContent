| **Native Origin** | California, USA (specifically Panamint Mountains and Death Valley region) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), tolerating intense heat and light. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and deep watering; drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in winter. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
Panamint Beardtongue thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native desert environment. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing to ensure its healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. If necessary, use a very diluted, low-phosphorus fertilizer once in spring, as desert soils are typically lean.
