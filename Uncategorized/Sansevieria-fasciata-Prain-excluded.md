## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Africa (Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, direct sunlight; can tolerate some partial shade but thrives in high light conditions. |
| **Watering** | Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic its native drought conditions. Overwatering leads to root rot. |

## Introduction
Sansevieria is a historically recognized genus of flowering plants, native to Africa, notably Madagascar, and southern Asia, now included in the genus Dracaena on the basis of molecular phylogenetic studies. Common names for the 70 or so species formerly placed in the genus include mother-in-law's tongue, devil's tongue, jinn's tongue, bow string hemp, snake plant and snake tongue. In the APG III classification system, Dracaena is placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Convallarioideae (formerly subfamily Nolinoideae); before that it was placed in family Ruscaceae. It has also been placed in the former family Dracaenaceae.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in bright, direct sunlight, reflective of its arid East African origins. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between sessions, and has minimal fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry environments.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Feed sparingly (once or twice during the growing season) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength.
