## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and Subarctic regions of North America, including Alaska (USA) and Canada. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, and Subalpine Boreal Forest margins. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) to partial sun, reflecting its growth in open, exposed environments. |
| **💧 Water** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet, well-drained soil, mimicking its native boggy or stream-side habitats. Do not allow soil to dry out, especially during the growing season. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Richardson's Willow thrives in full sun and demands consistently moist, well-drained soil to replicate its native tundra and subalpine wetland environments. It is a low to moderate feeder, benefiting from minimal fertilization in spring to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Benefits from a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, particularly if planted in very nutrient-poor soils.
