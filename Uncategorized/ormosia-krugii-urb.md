## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun is ideal, mimicking the dappled light of its native forest understory or mid-canopy. Avoid harsh, direct midday sun, especially when the plant is young. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged, reflecting the high rainfall and humidity of its tropical habitat. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil begins to feel dry, reducing frequency slightly in cooler, dormant periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Peronia is a genus of air-breathing sea slugs, a shell-less marine pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Onchidiidae. These slugs differ from other onchidiid slugs in having branched "gills" on their dorsal side, although these can be retracted. More than two dozen species of Peronia have been described from the Indo-West Pacific, but a recent revision of the genus determined that 21 of these names are synonyms. Nine species of Peronia are recognized, most of which can differentiated only by examining their internal anatomy or with DNA sequencing.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Native to the tropical moist forests of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, Ormosia krugii thrives in bright indirect to partial sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Regular feeding during the growing season supports its lush growth, mirroring the rich organic matter of its natural environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during fall and winter.
