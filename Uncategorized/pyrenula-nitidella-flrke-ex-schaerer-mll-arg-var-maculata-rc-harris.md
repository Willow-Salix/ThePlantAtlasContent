## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Humid subtropical and tropical regions, including southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Louisiana) and the Neotropics (Central and South America). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical to Tropical Forest / Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to Moderate, indirect light. As an epiphytic lichen, it typically grows in shaded or partially shaded conditions on tree bark, avoiding direct, intense sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity (70-90%+) is crucial. It absorbs moisture from the air and rainfall, so it requires frequent misting if kept indoors, rather than traditional soil watering. Consistent moisture is key, but not standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pyrenula is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Pyrenulaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in tropical regions, and contains about 200 species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This specific lichen thrives in extremely high humidity and low to moderate, indirect light, mimicking its native habitat on tree bark in humid subtropical and tropical forests. It requires no soil-based watering or fertilizer, instead relying on consistent atmospheric moisture through high humidity and frequent misting to survive and grow.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required. Lichens derive necessary nutrients directly from the atmosphere (dust, gases, rainwater) and the substrate. Excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
