## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America, from Nova Scotia and New England south to Florida and west to Louisiana and Missouri. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically wet woods, swamps, bogs, and marshy areas within this biome) |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade, preferring dappled light or indirect exposure. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can scorch its fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil is crucial, never allowing it to dry out. Regular and frequent watering is essential, mimicking its natural boggy habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
The moth genus Dryopteris is now considered a junior synonym of Oreta.

Dryopteris , commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to Dryopteris filix-mas), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales.
Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American Dryopteris hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization.
The fossil record of this genus shows that it was widespread even as far back as the Cretaceous with fossils being found in Late Cretaceous rock layers from North America down to Antarctica.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Eastern Marsh Fern, replicate its native boggy, shaded woodland environment. Ensure the soil remains consistently moist and provide ample shade or indirect light. Fertilize sparingly during the growing season to encourage healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer is sufficient. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
