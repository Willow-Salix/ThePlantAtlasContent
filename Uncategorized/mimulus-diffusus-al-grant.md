## 🌱 Overview
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Palomar monkeyflower thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, especially mimicking its native Mediterranean chaparral habitat. Provide moderate water during its active spring growth, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and minimize fertilizer. It is adapted to survive dry summer conditions once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor chaparral soils. Use a very dilute native plant formula if desired.
