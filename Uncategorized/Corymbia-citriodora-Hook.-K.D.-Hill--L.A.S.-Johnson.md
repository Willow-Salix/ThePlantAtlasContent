## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia (primarily Queensland, extending into northern New South Wales) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Woodland to Tropical Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, reflecting its open woodland habitat where it receives high light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering during establishment, then drought-tolerant once mature. Thrives with moderate, consistent moisture but can endure periods of dryness typical of its native climate. |

## Introduction
Corymbia citriodora, commonly known as lemon-scented gum and other common names, is a species of tall tree that is endemic to north-eastern Australia. It has smooth white to pink bark, narrow lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three, white flowers and urn-shaped or barrel-shaped fruit.

## Care Guide
This tree thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, tolerating various conditions once established. Provide regular water for young plants, reducing frequency as it matures, and apply minimal, low-phosphorus fertilizer. It requires ample space due to its large size.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Native soils in Australia are often low in phosphorus; use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer if needed, primarily for young trees.
