## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal Western Europe, Mediterranean region (North Africa, Southern Europe, Middle East), and Macaronesia |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland / Temperate Coastal |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers full sun exposure, reflecting its native habitat on open coastal cliffs and disturbed grounds. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. It is drought-tolerant once established, accustomed to dry summers in its native climate, but benefits from occasional deep watering during prolonged dry periods. |

It is one of several closely related genera in the family to bear the common English name mallow.

## Care Guide
Tree Mallow thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean coastal environment. It requires moderate watering, becoming drought-tolerant once established, and needs minimal fertilization. Ensure good air circulation and protection from severe frosts.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor, well-drained soils. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is generally sufficient, or none if the soil is reasonably fertile.
