## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Andes mountains, including Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Montane Cloud Forest to Temperate Highlands |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to bright indirect light; can tolerate some partial shade, especially in hotter climates. High altitude sun exposure suggests it appreciates intense light. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is key; keep soil evenly moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging, mimicking the well-drained but often damp conditions of its mountain habitat. |

## Introduction
Carica is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caricaceae including the papaya (C. papaya syn. C. peltata, C. posoposa), a widely cultivated fruit tree native to the American tropics.
The genus was formerly treated as including about 20-25 species of short-lived evergreen pachycaul shrubs or small trees growing to 5–10 m tall, native to tropical Central and South America, but recent genetic evidence has resulted in all of these species other than C. papaya being reclassified into three other genera.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Mountain Papaya needs bright light and consistent moisture, echoing its native cool, moist mountain climate. Ensure well-draining soil and provide moderate fertilization during growth. It prefers cooler temperatures and should be protected from extreme heat and frost.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate, balanced fertilization during its active growing season to support fruit production, reflecting the nutrient cycling in montane forest soils.
