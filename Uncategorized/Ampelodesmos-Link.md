## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean region, including North Africa (e.g., Mauritania, Algeria, Morocco) and Southern Europe (e.g., Spain, Italy, Greece) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun is preferred, tolerating partial sun. Its natural habitat in open grasslands and hillsides indicates a need for strong, direct light. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant once established. Requires moderate watering during active growth (spring/autumn), but needs significantly less water during hot, dry summers. Excellent drainage is essential to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Ampelodesmos is a  genus of Mediterranean plants in the grass family, which is known by the common names stramma, Mauritania grass, rope grass, and dis(s) grass. It is classified in its own tribe Ampelodesmeae within the grass subfamily Pooideae.
The genus probably originated through ancient hybrid speciation, as a cross between parents from tribes Stipeae and Phaenospermateae.
Ampelodesmos mauritanicus is a large clumping perennial bunchgrass, which is native to the Mediterranean region. It has been introduced outside its native range and is cultivated as an ornamental grass. Its nodding flower panicles can be nearly two feet long. In its native area it is used as a fiber for making mats, brooms, and twine. The plant can become an Invasive species in non-native ecosystems beyond the Mediterranean Basin.  In its native area it is used as a fiber for making mats, brooms, and twine. The leaves of this grass possess sharp edges and can inflict small lacerations on exposed skin.
The genus name comes from the Greek ampelos, "vine", and desmos, "bond", from its former use as a string to tie up grapevines.

## Care Guide
Mauritanian Grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its Mediterranean native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate water during cooler growing seasons and minimal water during hot, dry summers. Fertilizer needs are low, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to poorer, well-drained soils and generally does not require much fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial in very lean soils.
