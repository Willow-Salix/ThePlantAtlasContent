## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Intermountain West region of the United States, including states like Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and Oregon. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is essential, as it naturally grows in open, exposed, and often dry environments. |
| **Watering** | Low watering frequency. Allow the soil to dry out completely between deep waterings, mimicking its drought-tolerant nature in arid habitats. Avoid overwatering. |

## Introduction
Phacelia (phacelia, scorpionweed, heliotrope) is a genus of about 200 species of annual or perennial herbaceous plants in the borage family, native to North and South America. California is particularly rich in species with over 90 recorded in the region.
The genus is traditionally placed at family rank with the waterleafs (Hydrophyllaceae) in the order Boraginales. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, recognizing that the traditional Boraginaceae and Hydrophyllaceae are paraphyletic with respect to each other, merges the latter into the former and considers the family basal in the Euasterids I clade. Other botanists continue to recognize the Hydrophyllaceae and Boraginales after analysing the secondary structure of the ITS1 genetic region rather than its sequence for these higher taxonomic levels.  This placed Phacelia within the Hydrophyllaceae. Further molecular taxonomic analysis of the Boraginales has divided the Boraginales in two and placed Phacelia among the monophyletic herbaceous Hydrophyllaceae in Boraginales II.
The genus includes both annual and perennial species. Many have been cultivated as garden and honey plants.
There are reports that glandular hairs of stems, flowers and leaves of some species of Phacelia secrete oil droplets that can cause an unpleasant skin rash (contact dermatitis) in some people, specifically from P. brachyloba, P. campanularia, P. crenulata, P. gina-glenneae, P. grandiflora, P. ixodes, P. minor, and P. pedicellata. The major contact allergen of P. crenulata has been identified as geranylhydroquinone and of P. minor as geranylgeranylhydroquinone.
The mining bee Andrena phaceliae is a specialist pollinator of this genus in the Eastern United States.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in sunny, dry conditions with well-draining, lean soil, typical of its arid scrubland origins. It requires minimal watering once established and generally does not need frequent fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Its native soils are typically sandy, gravelly, and nutrient-poor, indicating it thrives with minimal supplemental nutrients.
