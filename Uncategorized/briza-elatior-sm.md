## 🌱 Overview
Briza is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the grass family, native to northern temperate regions of Eurasia, North Africa, and certain islands in the Atlantic.
The group is generally referred to as the quaking grasses because the flowers and seedheads shake on their stalks in the slightest breeze. Some of its members are grown as ornamental plants.
Briza species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora lixella.

Species
Briza humilis M.Bieb. – from Albania to Iran
Briza marcowiczii Woronow – Turkey, Caucasus
Briza maxima L. – Mediterranean, Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands; naturalized in parts of Asia, Africa, Australia, the Americas, and certain oceanic islands

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Greater Quaking Grass, recognized botanically as Briza elatior Sm., thrives in conditions mirroring its Mediterranean origins, preferring full to partial sun. Water moderately during its spring growth phase, ensuring the soil dries between waterings, and reduce significantly during summer due to its excellent drought tolerance. It requires minimal fertilization and adapts well to various well-drained soil types.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor soils without heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if desired, but often not necessary.
