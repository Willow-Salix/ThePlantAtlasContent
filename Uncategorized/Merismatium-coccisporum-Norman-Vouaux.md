## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe and North America, often in areas with high atmospheric humidity. |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate Forest / Temperate Rainforest (specifically the shaded, damp understory or rocky outcrops) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to very low indirect light; thrives in deep shade or dappled light conditions. Direct sunlight will be detrimental. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and a damp, but not waterlogged, substrate. Regular misting or placement in a high-humidity environment (e.g., terrarium) is essential. |

## Care Guide
To care for Merismatium lichen, ensure a consistently damp environment with very high humidity and only low, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight and refrain from using any chemical fertilizers, as they can be detrimental to this sensitive organism.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and their substrate and are highly sensitive to chemical fertilizers, which can be harmful.
