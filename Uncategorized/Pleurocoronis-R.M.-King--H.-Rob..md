## Care Guide
Pleurocoronis thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid desert, requiring full sun and excellent drainage. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry out between applications to prevent rot. Minimal to no fertilization is necessary for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilization needed. If desired, a highly diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in early spring during active growth.
