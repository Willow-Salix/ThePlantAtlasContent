## Care Guide
Provide this plant with full sun to partial shade and well-drained, sandy soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and fertilize sparingly due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low, as its native sandy soils are typically nutrient-poor; use minimal or slow-release, low-dose fertilizer if necessary.
