## Introduction
Oenothera elata is a species of Oenothera known by the common name Hooker's evening primrose or tall evening primrose. Subspecies include hookeri, hirsutissima, longisima, jamesii, villosa and elata. It is native to much of western and central North America. The plants are quite tall, especially the hookeri subspecies, native to California, which can reach about 1.8 meters (6 feet) height.  The plants are found along roadsides, in moist meadows, or in woodland, from sea level up to 9,000 ft (2,700 m) in elevation.

## Care Guide
Hooker's Evening Primrose thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflective of its native Mediterranean and arid scrubland environments. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent deep watering during dry spells. Minimal fertilization is needed to ensure robust flowering and prevent excessive foliage growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Excessive fertilization can lead to more foliage and fewer flowers. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring is sufficient if needed.
