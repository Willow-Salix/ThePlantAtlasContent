## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern North America, primarily the Great Plains and eastern U.S. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open prairie habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; highly drought-tolerant once established due to adaptation to periods of dry weather in its native prairies. Allow soil to dry completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Schizachyrium scoparium, commonly known as little bluestem or beard grass, is a species of North American prairie grass native to most of the contiguous United States (except California, Nevada, and Oregon) as well as a small area north of the Canada–US border and northern Mexico. It is most common in the Midwestern prairies and is one of the most abundant native plants in Texas grasslands.
Little bluestem is a perennial bunchgrass and is prominent in tallgrass prairies, along with big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). It is a warm-season species, meaning it employs the C4 photosynthetic pathway.

## Care Guide
Little Bluestem is a highly adaptable, low-maintenance prairie grass that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. This plant is ideal for naturalized landscapes or xeriscaping due to its resilience.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically no fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-variable prairie soils. Excessive fertilizer can lead to weak, leggy growth.
