## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full, direct sun and requires excellent drainage. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilizer needs are minimal, mimicking its native arid environment.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Native soils are typically nutrient-poor. Minimal to no fertilization is required; if grown in pots, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
