## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant grass thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. Native to rocky slopes and open woodlands of eastern North America, it requires minimal watering once established and tolerates low to moderate soil fertility, making it a low-maintenance option for dry landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, especially in poor soils. Avoid excessive fertilization, as this grass is adapted to lean conditions.
