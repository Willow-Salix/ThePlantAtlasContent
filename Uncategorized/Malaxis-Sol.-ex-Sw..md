## Introduction

## Care Guide
Malaxis orchids flourish in environments that mimic their humid, shaded native habitats. Provide consistent moisture in a well-draining medium and ensure low to moderate indirect light. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted solution during periods of active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization (e.g., quarter-strength orchid fertilizer) during active growth periods.
