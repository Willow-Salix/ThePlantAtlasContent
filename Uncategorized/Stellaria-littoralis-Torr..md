## Care Guide
Beach Starwort thrives in bright, exposed conditions with well-draining soil, mimicking its native coastal environment. Provide moderate watering, ensuring the soil dries out between applications, and be mindful of its low nutrient needs. Excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low. Native to nutrient-poor sandy soils, it does not require frequent or heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year is sufficient if needed.
