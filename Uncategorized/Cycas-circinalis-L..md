| **Native Origin** | Southern India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia |
| **Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Dry Deciduous Forest and Coastal |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers bright, indirect light or morning sun in very hot climates to prevent leaf scorch, reflecting its growth in open woodlands or forest edges. |

## Introduction
Sago palm is a common name for several plants which are used to produce a starchy food known as sago. Sago palms may be "true palms" in the family Arecaceae, or cycads with a palm-like appearance. Sago produced from cycads must be detoxified before consumption. Plants called sago palm include:

Metroxylon (true sago palms), a genus in the palm family (Arecaceae) native to Southeast Asia
Cycads
Cycas revoluta, (king sago palm), native to Japan and widely cultivated as an ornamental plant
Cycas rumphii, (queen sago palm), native to southeast Asia
Cycas circinalis, (queen sago palm), native to India

## Care Guide
The Queen Sago thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical origin with bright light and a cycle of regular watering followed by dry periods. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot and provide light fertilization during active growth for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season (spring/summer), as it naturally grows in moderately fertile to poor, well-draining soils.
