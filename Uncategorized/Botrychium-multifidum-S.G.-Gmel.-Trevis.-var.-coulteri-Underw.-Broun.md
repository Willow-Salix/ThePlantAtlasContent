## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Pacific Northwest to Rocky Mountains) |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Boreal |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Sun to Partial Shade (tolerates some direct morning sun, prefers protection from intense afternoon sun, mimicking forest edges and open clearings) |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Mimics its natural habitat of moist meadows and bogs that are damp but not stagnant. |

## Introduction
Botrychium is a genus of ferns, seedless vascular plants in the family Ophioglossaceae. Botrychium species are known as moonworts. They are small, with fleshy roots, and reproduce by spores shed into the air. One part of the leaf, the trophophore, is sterile and fernlike; the other, the sporophore, is fertile and carries the clusters of sporangia or spore cases.  Some species only occasionally emerge above ground and gain most of their nourishment from an association with mycorrhizal fungi.

## Care Guide
Leathery Grapefern (Coulter's variety) thrives in cool, moist, temperate environments. It prefers partial sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Fertilization should be minimal, if at all, as it's not a heavy feeder, reflecting its preference for less nutrient-rich habitats.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. If fertilizing, use a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly during the active growing season. Native soils are often not exceptionally rich.
