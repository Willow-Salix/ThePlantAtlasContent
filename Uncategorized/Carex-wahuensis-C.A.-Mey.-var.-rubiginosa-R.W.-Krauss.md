## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian sedge thrives in cool, moist conditions with filtered light. Ensure the soil remains consistently damp, never allowing it to dry out completely, and provide high humidity if possible. Fertilize sparingly to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer).
