## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Neotropics (e.g., Central America, Caribbean, northern South America), Southeastern USA (Florida) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Deep shade to low indirect light. This fern thrives in the very low light conditions of the rainforest understory, avoiding any direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist; the substrate should never dry out. Requires extremely high ambient humidity (70-90% or more), often needing misting or terrarium conditions. |

## Introduction
Trichomanes is a genus of ferns in the family Hymenophyllaceae, termed bristle ferns. The circumscription of the genus is disputed. All ferns in the genus are filmy ferns, with leaf tissue typically 2 cells thick.  This thinness generally necessitates a permanently humid habitat, and makes the fronds somewhat translucent. Because of this membrane-like frond tissue, the plant is prone to drying out. "Filmy ferns" in the taxa Hymenophyllaceae grow in constantly wet environments. Many are found in cloud forests such as "Choco" in Colombia. There are also members of the taxa that can grow submersed in water. 
The name bristle fern refers to the small bristle that protrudes from the indusia of these ferns.

## Care Guide
This delicate bristle fern demands extremely high humidity, consistently moist growing medium, and very low light, replicating its native tropical rainforest habitat. It is best suited for enclosed environments like terrariums or vivariums where its specific environmental needs can be met reliably.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. Apply a very diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/8 strength) once a month during active growth. Over-fertilization can harm this delicate epiphyte.
