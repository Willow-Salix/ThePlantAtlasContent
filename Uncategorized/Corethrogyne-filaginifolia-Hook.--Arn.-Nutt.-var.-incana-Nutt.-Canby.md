## Care Guide
To care for the Woolly Aster, provide full sun exposure and well-draining soil, replicating its native coastal scrubland environment. Water sparingly, only when the soil is dry, as it is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to overwatering. Avoid excessive fertilization to maintain its natural vigor.

### Fertilizer
Fertilizer needs are low; it thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils and generally does not require heavy feeding.
