| **Native Origin** | Rocky Mountains of the Western United States (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright light, similar to its high-altitude native habitat, but can benefit from some afternoon shade in extremely hot climates. |

## Introduction
Gentiana () is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the gentian family (Gentianaceae), the tribe Gentianeae, and the monophyletic subtribe Gentianinae. With over 300 species, it is considered a large genus. Gentians are notable for their mostly large trumpet-shaped flowers, which are often of an intense blue hue, though some are also bright yellow. The type species of the genus is Gentiana lutea.
The genus name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king who may have discovered tonic properties in gentians.

## Care Guide
Parry's Gentian thrives in conditions mimicking its Rocky Mountain native habitat. Provide full to partial sun, ensuring consistent soil moisture with excellent drainage. Fertilize lightly in spring for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding. A low-dose, balanced slow-release fertilizer once in early spring is usually sufficient. Prioritize well-draining soil with moderate organic content over heavy fertilization.
