## Introduction
Oxytropis is a genus of plants in the legume family. It includes over 600 species native to subarctic to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. It is one of three genera of plants known as locoweeds, and are notorious for being toxic to grazing animals. The other locoweed genus is the closely related Astragalus. Most oxtropis species are native to Eurasia and North America, but several species are native to the Arctic. These are hairy perennial plants which produce raceme inflorescences of pink, purple, white, or yellow flowers which are generally pea-like but have distinctive sharply beaked keels. The stems are leafless, the leaves being all basal. The plant produces legume pods containing the seeds.

## Care Guide
This rare alpine plant thrives in full sun on well-drained, lean, calcareous soil. Provide consistent moisture during its short growing season, ensuring no waterlogging, and avoid rich fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low; prefers lean, mineral-rich, calcareous soils. Avoid rich organic fertilizers. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen.
