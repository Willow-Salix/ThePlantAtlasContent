# Coral Granular Lichen

*Lopadium coralloideum (Nyl.) Lynge* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including northern North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska, Pacific Northwest), Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia), and Siberia. |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest (Taiga) and humid Temperate Rainforests, often found in sub-alpine or alpine zones. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers indirect light to partial shade, mimicking its native habitat under dense tree canopies or in shaded, humid areas. Direct, intense sunlight should be avoided as it can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and a perpetually moist (but not waterlogged) substrate. Regular misting is crucial, and the environment should simulate frequent precipitation, fog, or dew. Avoid drying out completely. |

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, highly humid conditions with indirect light, mirroring its native boreal and temperate forest environments. Maintain a consistently moist substrate through regular misting and ensure high ambient humidity, while strictly avoiding any form of fertilization.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere, rain, and trace elements, and are highly sensitive to external chemical inputs and pollutants.
