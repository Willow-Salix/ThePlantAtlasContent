## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic regions of North America (Alaska, Canada, Greenland) and parts of Siberia |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, tolerating the intense but low-angle sunlight typical of high latitudes during its short growing season. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil during the active growing period, allowing the surface to dry slightly between waterings, mimicking snowmelt and boggy conditions, but ensuring good drainage. |

## Introduction
Noccaea is a problematic genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, native to temperate areas of western North America, southern South America, northern Africa, Europe and Asia.

## Care Guide
Arctic Pennycress thrives in cool, exposed conditions with full sun during its brief growing period. It prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil and requires minimal fertilization, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor tundra environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed, as tundra soils are typically poor in nutrients and high in organic matter that decomposes slowly.
