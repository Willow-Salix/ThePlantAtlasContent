## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, accustomed to the intense light and low moisture of arid environments. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal water once established, and generally needs little to no fertilization due to its adaptation to poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy, or rocky soils and generally does not require fertilization, or at most a very light, balanced application once a year in spring if grown in particularly poor soil.
