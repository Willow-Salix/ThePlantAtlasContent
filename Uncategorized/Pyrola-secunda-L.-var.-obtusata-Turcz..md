## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska), Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Russia), and Northern Asia (e.g., Siberia, Japan) |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest (Taiga) and Cool Temperate Coniferous Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate light, preferring dappled shade or partial shade; avoid direct, harsh sun which can scorch foliage. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged, ensuring excellent drainage. Mimic the steady moisture levels found on a forest floor. |

## Introduction
Pyrola  is a genus of evergreen herbaceous plants in the family Ericaceae. Under the old Cronquist system it was placed in its own family Pyrolaceae, but genetic research showed it belonged in the family Ericaceae. The species are commonly known as wintergreen, a name shared with several other related and unrelated plants (see wintergreen for details). They are native to northern temperate and Arctic regions.
They are rather small plants with a rosette of simple orbicular or ovate leaves, with a flower stem bearing generally rather lax racemes of simple white, cream or pink flowers. The immediate distinguishing feature of Pyrola species is the flower style which is often curved, sticks out beyond the petals and is expanded below the stigma which itself is branched into several lobes. To the casual observer the flower appears to have a small bell-clapper sticking out.

## Care Guide
Obtuse Wintergreen flourishes in cool, shaded conditions replicating its native boreal forest understory. It requires consistently moist, well-drained, organically rich soil and must be protected from intense direct sunlight. Fertilize lightly and infrequently to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in organically rich, somewhat acidic soil. Use a light, balanced organic fertilizer sparingly, primarily to enrich the soil rather than force growth.
