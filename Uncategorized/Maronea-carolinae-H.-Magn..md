# Carolina Maronea Lichen

*Maronea carolinae H. Magn.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to partial shade; protect from direct, intense sunlight which can cause desiccation. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity is crucial. This lichen absorbs moisture from the air and rainfall; regular misting (with distilled or rainwater) and placement in a high-humidity environment are more beneficial than traditional watering. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
The Carolina maronea lichen thrives in high humidity and indirect light, replicating its native humid subtropical forest conditions. Provide consistent moisture primarily through ambient humidity and occasional misting, as traditional watering and fertilization are not suitable for this organism.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from the atmosphere, rain, and substrate, and traditional plant fertilizers can be harmful.
