## Care Guide
Hawai'i Hala Pepe thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, mimicking its native forest habitat. Ensure consistent moisture, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and provide moderate humidity. Fertilize lightly during the active growing season for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength, every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or stop feeding during fall and winter.
