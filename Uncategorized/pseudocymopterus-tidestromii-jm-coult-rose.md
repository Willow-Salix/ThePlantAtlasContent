# Tidestrom's False Springparsley
### *Pseudocymopterus tidestromii J.M. Coult. & Rose*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (e.g., Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane to Subalpine Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, reflecting its exposure on rocky slopes and open woodlands. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate; thrives in dry conditions. Water deeply when the topsoil is dry, then allow it to dry out completely before the next watering, mimicking seasonal precipitation patterns. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient montane plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained, rocky soils, reflecting its arid native habitat. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established. Fertilization is generally not needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; native to rocky, often nutrient-poor soils. Fertilization is rarely needed; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring if soil is exceptionally poor.
