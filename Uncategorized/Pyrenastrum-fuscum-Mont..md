## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pantropical regions, including parts of South America, Central America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. Thrives in dappled shade, protected from direct, intense sunlight that can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and consistent moisture are crucial. As a lichen, it absorbs water directly from atmospheric moisture and rainfall. If cultivated, frequent misting or a humid environment is necessary, avoiding prolonged dryness. |

## Care Guide
This lichen requires a consistently humid environment with ample atmospheric moisture and protection from direct sunlight. It thrives on bark or rock in conditions mimicking its tropical rainforest origin, absorbing all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere and rain.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Lichens obtain nutrients from atmospheric deposition and dissolved minerals in rain; standard plant fertilizers can be harmful.
