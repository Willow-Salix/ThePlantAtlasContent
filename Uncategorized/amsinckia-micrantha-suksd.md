## 🌱 Overview
Amsinckia is a genus of flowering plants commonly known as fiddlenecks.  The common name is derived from the flower stems, which curl over at the top in a manner reminiscent of the head of a fiddle.  Fiddlenecks are in the family Boraginaceae, along with borage and forget-me-nots. The genus is named after the patrician Amsinck family in honour of the Hamburg head of state and patron of botany Wilhelm Amsinck (1752–1831).
