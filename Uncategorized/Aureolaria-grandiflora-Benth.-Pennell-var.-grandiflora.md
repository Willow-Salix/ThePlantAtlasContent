## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland/Forest Edge |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to full sun. Thrives in areas with good light, similar to the dappled light of open woodlands or full sun at forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Water regularly to keep soil moist but well-drained, allowing the top inch or two to dry slightly between waterings, mimicking typical rainfall patterns in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Aureolaria, with the common name false foxgloves, is a genus of 8 species, native to North America.
Aureolaria plants are hemiparasitic, which is a character that in part describes the family Orobanchaceae.
Until recently the genus was aligned with members of the family Scrophulariaceae.  As a result of numerous molecular phylogenetic studies based on various chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) loci, it was shown to be more closely related to members of the Orobanchaceae.

## Care Guide
This temperate woodland plant thrives in partial to full sun and requires moderately moist, well-drained soil. It is relatively low-maintenance regarding fertilizer and can tolerate some drought once established, reflecting its adaptability in its native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native to naturally occurring soils, it generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil is poor.
