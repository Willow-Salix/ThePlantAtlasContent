## 🌱 Overview
Verbesina, many species of which have crownbeard as part of their common names, is a genus of flowering plants, in the family Asteraceae. It is a large genus of about 350 species.
All of the species bear white or yellow flowers similar to small sunflowers. The name Verbesina very likely refers to the similarity of the foliage to that of the (unrelated) Verbena.
Verbesina species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species. These include Schinia bina, which has been recorded from V. encelioides, and Schinia siren which feeds exclusively on that species.
Pollen grains from eight of the nine species of Verbesina found in Brazil have been characterized as oblate-spheroidal, medium-sized, isopolar monads. They are 3-colplorate with a subtriangular amb, a small polar area, a long colpus, a lalongate endoaperture, a caveate exine and an echinate sexine.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dwarf crownbeard thrives in full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native humid subtropical woodland habitat. It prefers consistently moist, well-draining sandy soils and, while drought-tolerant once established, benefits from regular watering. Minimal fertilization is typically required for this resilient plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; an annual application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost is sufficient, especially in nutrient-poor sandy soils.
