## 🌱 Overview
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This narrowleaf bedstraw thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering only during prolonged dry spells. It prefers well-draining soil and does not need heavy fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant suitable for Mediterranean-style gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; a light, balanced fertilizer in spring if growth seems sluggish, otherwise not essential.
