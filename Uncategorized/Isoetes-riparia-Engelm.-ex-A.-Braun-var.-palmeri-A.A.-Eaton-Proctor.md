## Introduction
Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of lycopod. It is the only living genus in the family Isoetaceae and order Isoetales. As of 2016, there were about 200 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution mostly in aquatic habitats but with the individual species often scarce to rare. Species virtually identical to modern quillworts have existed since the Jurassic epoch, though the timing of the origin of modern Isoetes is subject to considerable uncertainty.
The name of the genus may also be spelled Isoëtes. The diaeresis (two dots over the e) indicates that the o and the e are to be pronounced in two distinct syllables. Including this in print is optional; either spelling (Isoetes or Isoëtes) is correct.

## Care Guide
This aquatic fern ally thrives in temperate wetland conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade. It must be continuously submerged in shallow water or grown in consistently saturated soil. Provide a nutrient-rich substrate and supplement with aquatic fertilizer as needed for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from nutrient-rich aquatic substrate or occasional aquatic plant fertilizer.
