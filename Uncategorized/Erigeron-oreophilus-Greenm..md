| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the active growing season (spring); allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal water during dry summer periods. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Chaparral Fleabane prefers full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native chaparral environment. It needs moderate watering in spring, becoming very drought-tolerant as summer progresses, and has low nutrient requirements.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in leaner soils; over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if needed.
