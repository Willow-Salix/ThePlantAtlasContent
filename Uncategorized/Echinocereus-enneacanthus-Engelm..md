## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and northern Mexico (Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Nuevo León, San Luis Potosí, Sonora, Zacatecas) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland (Chihuahuan Desert) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day, reflecting its open desert habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. During winter dormancy, water very sparingly or not at all. Requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## Care Guide
This desert cactus demands full, direct sunlight and extremely well-draining soil. Water sparingly, allowing the substrate to dry entirely between applications, especially reducing water in cooler months. Fertilize very lightly with a low-nitrogen formula during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer needed. Use a low-nitrogen, high-potassium fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring to early summer), reflecting the lean desert soils.
