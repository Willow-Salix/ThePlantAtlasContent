| **Native Origin** | California, USA (Sierra Nevada foothills and inner North Coast Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Temperate Woodland/Chaparral/Grassland) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun, especially during its active growth in spring. Can tolerate full morning sun in cooler climates. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives by replicating its native Mediterranean cycle: abundant moisture and good light during its active spring growth, followed by a dry, dormant period through the hot summer. Ensure well-draining soil and avoid any watering during summer dormancy to prevent rot.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost tea can be beneficial once in early spring at the start of active growth. Avoid heavy feeding.
