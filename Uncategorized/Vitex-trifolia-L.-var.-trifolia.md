## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal and riparian areas across tropical and subtropical Asia (e.g., India, Southeast Asia), Australia, and the Pacific Islands. |
| **Climate** | Coastal Tropical and Subtropical, often with monsoon influence, characterized by warm temperatures year-round, high humidity, and distinct wet and dry seasons. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; thrives with ample direct sunlight, typical of open coastal environments and disturbed areas. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, especially during dry periods, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings to mimic monsoon patterns; tolerant of some drought due to its native habitat on sandy coasts. |

## Care Guide
Provide this resilient plant with ample sunlight and consistent, but not waterlogged, moisture, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings to emulate its native coastal monsoon conditions. It thrives in warm temperatures and tolerates various soil types, requiring only light fertilization during its growth phase.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate balanced fertilizer during the active growing season; it is adaptable to the often nutrient-poor sandy or disturbed soils of its native habitat and is not a heavy feeder.
