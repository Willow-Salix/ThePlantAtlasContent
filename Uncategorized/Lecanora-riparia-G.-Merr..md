## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically coastal and interior regions of California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Riparian (influenced by coastal or mountainous humidity), found on rocks near water bodies. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun exposure; thrives on exposed rock surfaces but benefits from consistent atmospheric moisture. |
| **Watering** | Frequent exposure to atmospheric moisture (rain, fog, dew) and occasional splashing from water bodies, allowing for complete drying between moistening events. |

## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
This saxicolous lichen thrives on stable, siliceous rocks in riparian zones of Western North America, requiring consistent atmospheric moisture from fog, rain, or water splash, interspersed with dry periods. It tolerates bright indirect light to partial sun exposure and does not need traditional fertilization, deriving all necessary nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
None; as a lichen, it absorbs trace nutrients directly from the air, rain, and the rock surface, not requiring traditional fertilizers.
