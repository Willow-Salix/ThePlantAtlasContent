## Care Guide
As a desert native, Jumping Cholla thrives in full, direct sun and requires minimal water, tolerating long periods of drought. Ensure extremely well-draining soil to prevent root rot, mimicking its natural sandy environment. Fertilizer needs are negligible, only applying a specialized cactus food sparingly during its active growth phase.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. If desired, a highly diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer).
