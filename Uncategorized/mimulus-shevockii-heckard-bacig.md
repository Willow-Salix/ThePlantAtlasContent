## 🌱 Overview
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rare California native thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its natural seep environment. It prefers full sun with abundant water, or partial shade to protect it from intense heat. Fertilization should be minimal to support its adaptation to less nutrient-rich conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. If necessary, use a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly at the start of the growing season.
