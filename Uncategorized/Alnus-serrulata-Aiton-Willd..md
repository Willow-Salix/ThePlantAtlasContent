## Care Guide
This water-loving shrub thrives in consistently moist to wet soils and can tolerate a range of light conditions from full sun to partial shade. Due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities, it has low fertilizer requirements, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant for suitable wet environments.

### Fertilizer
Low; as a nitrogen-fixing species, it enriches the soil and generally does not require high external nitrogen fertilization.
