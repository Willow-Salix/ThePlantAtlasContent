## Care Guide
Dwarf Labrador Tea thrives in cold, wet, and acidic conditions, making it a challenging plant outside its native range. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil remains consistently moist, never allowing it to dry out. Fertilizer should be minimal or absent, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. If necessary, use a very dilute, acid-forming fertilizer.
