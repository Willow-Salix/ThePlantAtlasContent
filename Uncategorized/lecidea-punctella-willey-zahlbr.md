## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lecidea punctella thrives in high humidity and dappled light, typical of temperate forest environments. It requires periodic moisture for hydration but should not be kept constantly wet. No soil or external fertilization is needed, as it naturally colonizes tree bark and obtains nutrients from the air.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilization is required or recommended. Lichens derive nutrients from the atmosphere and their substrate.
