## Care Guide
This wetland plant thrives in full sun to partial sun conditions with consistently wet, even saturated, soil. Mimicking its native humid subtropical wetland environment, it requires ample water and benefits from moderate fertilization to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to low fertilization is sufficient, adapting to the often nutrient-poor or moderately rich soils of its wetland habitat.
