## Care Guide
This hollyfern hybrid thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate forest understory. Provide partial to full shade and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil. Light fertilization during the active growing season will support robust frond development.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. Use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength, once a month during the growing season (spring/summer).
