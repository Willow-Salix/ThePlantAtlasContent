## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across Tropical Africa, including West, Central, East, and Southern regions. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Savanna/Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in open areas with high light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season (mimicking the wet season), allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce frequency significantly or provide a dry period during dormancy (mimicking the dry season). |

## Introduction
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. Species are distributed widely – from Quebec to northern Argentina in the Americas, across northern and southern tropical Africa, in the southern Arabian Peninsula, in Myanmar and Thailand, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia.

## Care Guide
This tropical African legume thrives in conditions mimicking its native savanna, preferring full sun to partial shade. Water moderately during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and reduce water during a dormant dry season. Fertilize lightly with a balanced feed, acknowledging its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season, especially given its nitrogen-fixing ability as a legume. Avoid over-fertilizing.
