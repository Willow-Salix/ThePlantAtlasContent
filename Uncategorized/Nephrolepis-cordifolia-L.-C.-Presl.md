## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pantropical and Subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia, Australia, Africa, and the Americas. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. As an understory plant in its native habitat, it cannot tolerate direct, intense sunlight which will scorch its fronds. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking the frequent rainfall and high humidity of its native environment. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil begins to dry, but avoid waterlogging. High ambient humidity is also crucial. |

## Introduction
Nephrolepis is a genus of about 30 species of ferns. It is the only genus in the family Nephrolepidaceae, placed in the suborder Aspleniineae (eupolypods I) of the order Polypodiales in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). (It is placed in the Dryopteridaceae in some other classifications.) Species in this genus include plants commonly referred to as Boston ferns. The fronds are long and narrow, and once-pinnate, in the case of one Bornean species reaching thirty feet (nine meters) in length.

## Care Guide
To thrive, the Narrow Swordfern needs conditions similar to its native tropical forest floor: consistent moisture, high humidity, and bright, indirect light. Keep the soil moist but not soggy, and provide occasional light fertilization during the growing season to support healthy frond development.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
