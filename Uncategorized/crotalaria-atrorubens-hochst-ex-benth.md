## 🌱 Overview
Crotalaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae (subfamily Faboideae) commonly known as rattlepods. The genus includes over 700 species of herbaceous plants and shrubs. Africa is the continent with the majority of Crotalaria species (approximately 400 species), which are mainly found in damp grassland, especially in floodplains, depressions and along edges of swamps and rivers, but also in deciduous bush land, roadsides and fields. Some species of Crotalaria are grown as ornamentals. The common name rattlepod or rattlebox is derived from the fact that the seeds become loose in the pod as they mature, and rattle when the pod is shaken. The name derives from the Ancient Greek κρόταλον, meaning "castanet", and is the same root as the name for the rattlesnakes (Crotalus).
Crotalaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Endoclita sericeus, Etiella zinckenella and Utetheisa ornatrix. The toxic alkaloids produced by some members of this genus are known to be incorporated by Utetheisia larvae and used to secure their defense from predators.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This species thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical African savanna environment, preferring full sun and well-draining soil. Water regularly during active growth, allowing for dry periods, and provide minimal fertilization due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen, reducing the need for external nitrogen fertilizer. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth appears stunted.
