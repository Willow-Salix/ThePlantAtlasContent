## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (specifically inner South Coast Ranges and southern Sierra Nevada foothills) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean / Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, thriving in open, exposed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Low. Extremely drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly during its active growing season (spring), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires very little to no water during its dormant summer and fall months. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Inland Gilia thrives in its native Mediterranean/Arid Scrubland conditions, demanding full sun and exceptionally well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering primarily during its active spring growth, and minimal to no fertilization. Mimicking its dry, sunny habitat is crucial for successful cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor or moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental. If growth appears very weak, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in early spring.
