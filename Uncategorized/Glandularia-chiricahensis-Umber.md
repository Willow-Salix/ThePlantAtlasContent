## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arid-adapted plant flourishes in full sun and well-draining soil, demanding very little water once established. It tolerates lean conditions and requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; thrives in lean soils. A light application of balanced granular fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary.
