## Introduction
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## Care Guide
This arid-adapted plant flourishes in full sun and well-draining soil, demanding very little water once established. It tolerates lean conditions and requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; thrives in lean soils. A light application of balanced granular fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary.
