## Care Guide
Thriving in its native dry tropical scrubland, Chirriador requires full sun and is very drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering. It prefers well-draining soil and low to moderate fertilization, making it a robust, low-maintenance plant for warm, sunny conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization needs. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year in spring or early summer, primarily to support new growth.
