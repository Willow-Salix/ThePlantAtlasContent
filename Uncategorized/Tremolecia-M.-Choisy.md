## Care Guide
This rock-dwelling lichen thrives in cool, exposed conditions with alternating periods of moisture and dryness. Provide bright, indirect light, mist infrequently allowing full drying, and never apply fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and substrate; added nutrients can be harmful.
