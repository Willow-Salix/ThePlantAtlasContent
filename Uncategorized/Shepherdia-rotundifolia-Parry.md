## Care Guide
The Roundleaf Buffaloberry is a hardy, low-maintenance shrub best suited for arid landscapes. It requires full sun and minimal watering once established, thriving in poor soils without the need for fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy desert soils and can fix its own nitrogen, making additional fertilization unnecessary.
