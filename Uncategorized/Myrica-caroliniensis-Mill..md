## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, specifically coastal regions from Newfoundland, Canada, south to Florida, USA, and west to parts of the Gulf Coast states. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coastal and Maritime Forests, Scrublands, and Dunes |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in full sun, tolerating some afternoon shade, especially in hotter parts of its range. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil but is highly drought-tolerant once established. Water regularly during its establishment phase; mature plants generally require infrequent watering, tolerating dry conditions. |

## Introduction
Myrica pensylvanica, the northern bayberry, is a species of Myrica native to eastern North America, from Newfoundland west to Ontario and Ohio, and south to North Carolina. It is also classified as Morella pensylvanica.
Myrica pensylvanica is a deciduous shrub growing to 4.5 m tall. The leaves are 2.5–7 cm long and 1.5-2.7 cm broad, broadest near the leaf apex, serrate, and sticky with a spicy scent when crushed. The flowers are borne in catkins 3–18 mm long, in range of colors from green to red. The fruit is a wrinkled berry 3–5.5 mm diameter, with a pale blue-purple waxy coating; they are an important food for yellow-rumped warblers.
This species has root nodules containing nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, allowing it to grow in relatively poor soils.

## Care Guide
Northern Bayberry is a resilient shrub native to the coastal environments of Eastern North America, adapting well to various conditions including sandy, infertile soils. It flourishes in full sun to partial shade and, due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, requires minimal to no fertilizer. Once established, this plant is remarkably drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering.

### Fertilizer
Low. As a nitrogen-fixing plant, it enriches the soil and thrives in poor, sandy, acidic conditions. Supplemental fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful if overdone.
