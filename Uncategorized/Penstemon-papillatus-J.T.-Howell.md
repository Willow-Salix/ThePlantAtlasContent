## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
The Inyo beardtongue flourishes in full sun and well-draining, rocky soils, mimicking its native arid mountain environment. It requires minimal watering once established, being highly drought-tolerant. Avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant thrives in lean, rocky soils and does not require heavy fertilization.
