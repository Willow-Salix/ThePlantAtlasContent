## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across wetlands in temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, typically where parent Typha species overlap. |
| **Climate** | Temperate and Subtropical Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in abundant light, typical of open wetland environments. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to submerged conditions; roots must remain in water or very saturated soil, simulating its native wetland habitat. |

## Introduction
Typha  is a genus of about 30 species of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the family Typhaceae. These plants have a variety of common names, in British English bulrush or (mainly historically) reedmace, in American English cattail or punks, in Australia cumbungi or bulrush, in Canada bulrush or cattail, and in New Zealand raupō, bullrush, cattail, or reed.
The genus is largely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, where it is found in a variety of wetland habitats. Although they can accumulate toxins in polluted areas, many parts of the plant are edible, including the starchy rhizomes.

## Care Guide
This wetland hybrid thrives in consistently wet to submerged conditions, ideally under full to partial sun exposure. It prefers nutrient-rich, mucky soils. Ensure constant water availability and provide moderate fertilization for healthy growth, mimicking its natural aquatic environment.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization in nutrient-rich, mucky soil, characteristic of decomposing organic matter in wetland ecosystems.
