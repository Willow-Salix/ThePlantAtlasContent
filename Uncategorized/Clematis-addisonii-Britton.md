## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Woodlands and Forest Edges |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it is found in open woodlands, rocky slopes, and bluffs, suggesting it tolerates a good amount of direct light but can also thrive with some afternoon shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate and consistent watering. Given its temperate origin and preference for well-drained sites (like rocky slopes), it requires consistent moisture but should not be waterlogged. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clematis is a genus of about 380 species within the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae. Their garden hybrids and cultivars have been popular among gardeners, beginning with Clematis 'Jackmanii', a garden staple since 1862. More cultivars are being produced constantly,  mainly of Chinese and Japanese origin.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Addison's Leather Flower thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained, moderately fertile soil reminiscent of its native rocky woodland habitat. Maintain consistent soil moisture without waterlogging, allowing for slight drying between waterings. Fertilize lightly during the active growing season to support robust health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season. Its native limestone soils can vary in fertility, so an all-purpose balanced fertilizer applied sparingly will generally suffice, avoiding over-fertilization.
