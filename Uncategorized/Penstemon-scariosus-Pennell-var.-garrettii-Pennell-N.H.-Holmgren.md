## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (Utah, Wyoming, Colorado) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
Garrett's beardtongue thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its native temperate montane habitat in the western US. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid rich fertilizers to promote robust, natural growth.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to poor soils. Avoid rich fertilizers; a light application of compost in spring is sufficient if needed.
