## Introduction
Valeriana is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae, members of which may be commonly known as valerians. It contains many species, including the garden valerian, Valeriana officinalis. Valeriana has centers of diversity in Eurasia and South America (especially in the Andes), and is represented by native species on all continents except Antarctica. 
Some species have been introduced to parts of the world outside their native range, including Valeriana rubra in the western United States and Valeriana macrosiphon in Western Australia.

## Care Guide
This annual thrives in full sun to partial sun, preferring consistently moist soil during its spring to early summer growing season. Native to temperate moist meadows and woodland edges of western North America, it generally requires low to moderate fertilization. Ensure steady moisture for optimal growth and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not required in good soil; a diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once during its active growth if soil is poor.
