## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across warm temperate and tropical arid and semi-arid regions globally, including parts of Africa, Southern Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. |
| **Climate** | Arid Grassland and Semi-Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun. Requires direct, intense sunlight for optimal growth, mimicking its open native habitats. |

## Introduction
Aristida is a very nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. Aristida is distinguished by having three awns (bristles) on each lemma of each floret. The genus includes about 300 species found worldwide, often in arid warm regions. This genus is among those colloquially called three-awns wiregrasses, speargrasses and needlegrasses. The name Aristida is derived from the Latin "arista", meaning "awn".
They are characteristic of semiarid grassland. The Wiregrass Region of North America is named for A. stricta. Other locales where this genus is an important component of the ecosystem include the Carolina Bays, the sandhills of the Carolinas, and elsewhere, Mulga scrub in Australia, and the xeric grasslands around Lake Turkana in Africa. Local increases in the abundance of wiregrasses is a good indicator of overgrazing, as livestock avoid them.

## Care Guide
This resilient annual grass requires full sun and is exceptionally drought-tolerant, needing very little water. It thrives in poor soils, making fertilizer largely unnecessary. Mimic arid environments for successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Very low; generally no fertilizer is needed. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy, or rocky soils.
