## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal regions of western North America, specifically California and Baja California. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Coastal Fog Belt; Mediterranean-influenced Arid Scrubland with significant maritime fog. |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect bright light to partial shade, protected from intense direct sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires very high atmospheric humidity and consistent moisture from misting or fog-like conditions; avoid prolonged dryness or waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dendrographa is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Roccellaceae. It has seven species. These lichens form small, shrubby tufts that cling to bark or coastal rocks along the Pacific seaboard, with brown-grey main branches and paler, pencil-thin tips that lack a protective outer skin. The genus was originally established in 1895 for a single Pacific coast species, but molecular studies in the 2010s expanded it by transferring four additional species from other genera and led to the discovery of a seventh species in Brazil.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Dendrographa Lichen, replicate its native coastal fog belt environment. Provide high humidity and indirect bright light, ensuring it stays consistently moist through frequent misting while avoiding standing water. No fertilization is needed as it naturally absorbs nutrients from the atmosphere.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer required. Lichens obtain trace nutrients from the air and rain.
