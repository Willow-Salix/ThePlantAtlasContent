## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across tropical and subtropical Africa and Asia (e.g., India, Southeast Asia, East Africa), extending to parts of northern Australia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Savanna or Monsoonal Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial sun. It thrives in open, brightly lit environments, tolerant of direct sunlight for most of the day, reflecting its natural habitat in grasslands and open fields. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate watering during its active growing season, mimicking the heavy rainfall of its native monsoon season. It is drought-tolerant once established but appreciates consistent moisture without waterlogging. Allow the topsoil to dry out between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Alysicarpus is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. Species are known generally as moneyworts. Unusually for legumes, the leaves are simple (not compound).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, accustomed to the distinct wet and dry seasons of its native tropical savanna. Water regularly during active growth, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and fertilize sparingly as it fixes its own nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family, it is capable of nitrogen fixation and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer at the start of the growing season can support vigorous growth, particularly in very poor soils.
