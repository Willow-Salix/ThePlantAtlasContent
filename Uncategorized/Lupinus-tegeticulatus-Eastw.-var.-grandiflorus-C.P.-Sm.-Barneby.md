## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
This Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean and montane chaparral habitat. It is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, with minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low. As a legume, this plant fixes nitrogen, so high-nitrogen fertilizers are unnecessary and can be detrimental. A light, balanced phosphorus and potassium supplement may be beneficial in very poor soils.
