# Woodland Reindeer Lichen

*Cladonia sylvatica auct.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including temperate and subarctic areas of North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest, Taiga, Heathland |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Tolerates dappled shade but prefers good light exposure without intense, direct afternoon sun that could lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and regular moisture. As a lichen, it absorbs water directly from the air and precipitation; frequent misting is beneficial in dry conditions. Avoid prolonged desiccation. |

## Introduction
Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations.
Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).
Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.
Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dunes, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.
Larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes continuella, feed on Cladonia species.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light to partial sun. It requires consistent moisture, often from high ambient humidity or misting, and has virtually no nutrient needs, making fertilization harmful. Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues while maintaining humidity.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low; fertilization is generally detrimental as lichens derive necessary nutrients primarily from the atmosphere and their substrate, not soil-based fertilizers.
