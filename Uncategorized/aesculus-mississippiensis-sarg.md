## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Eastern United States (Mississippi River valley region) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight, but can tolerate some afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist, but not waterlogged, soil. Tolerates moderate drought once established, but performs best with adequate moisture, mimicking natural rainfall patterns of temperate forests. |

## 🌱 Overview
The genus Aesculus ( or ), with notable species including buckeye and horse chestnut, comprises 13–19 species of flowering plants in the family Sapindaceae. They are trees and shrubs native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with six species native to North America and seven to 13 species native to Eurasia. Several hybrids occur. Aesculus exhibits a classical Arcto-Tertiary distribution. 
Mexican buckeye seedpods resemble the Aesculus seedpods, but belong to a different genus.
Carl Linnaeus named the genus Aesculus after the Roman name for an edible acorn. Common names for these trees include "buckeye" and "horse chestnut", though they are not in the same order as the true chestnuts, Castanea in the Fagales. Some are also called white chestnut or red chestnut. In Britain, they are sometimes called conker trees because of their link to the game of conkers, played with the seeds, which are also called conkers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Mississippi Buckeye thrives in temperate climates, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, rich, well-drained soil. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry periods, and enrich the soil with organic matter or a balanced fertilizer to support its growth in a woodland-like environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, well-drained soil high in organic matter. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in early spring is beneficial, especially for young trees.
