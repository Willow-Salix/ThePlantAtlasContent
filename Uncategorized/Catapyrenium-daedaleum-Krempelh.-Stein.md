## Introduction
Catapyrenium is a genus of squamulose lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. These small lichens grow as clusters of tiny scales (squamules that lie flat against rocks and soil, often in dry or disturbed habitats.

## Care Guide
Earth Lichen thrives in cool, consistently moist, high-humidity environments with partial shade, mimicking its alpine and boreal origins. Provide regular moisture through misting or high ambient humidity, ensuring excellent drainage. Do not fertilize, as lichens are highly sensitive to added nutrients.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; lichens are highly sensitive to external nutrients and pollutants, which can be detrimental.
