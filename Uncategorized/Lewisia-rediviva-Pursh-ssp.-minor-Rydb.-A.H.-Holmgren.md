## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the intermountain west and Rocky Mountains at higher elevations. |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid to arid montane/alpine, characterized by cold, snowy winters and dry, warm to hot summers. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure is essential, replicating its native open, high-altitude habitats. |
| **Watering** | Requires minimal watering, thriving in drought-like conditions once established. Water sparingly, only when the soil is completely dry, and ensure excellent drainage to prevent rot, especially during its summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Lewisia is a plant genus, named for the American explorer Meriwether Lewis (1774-1809) who encountered the species in 1806. The native habitat of Lewisia species is rocky ground and cliffs in western North America. Native Americans ate the roots, which have also been used to treat sore throats.

## Care Guide
This plant demands full sun and exceptionally well-drained, lean soil, mirroring its high-altitude, rocky native environment. Water very sparingly, allowing it to experience dry periods, particularly during summer dormancy, to prevent rot. Avoid rich fertilizers as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs; thrives in lean, rocky, and well-drained soils. Avoid rich fertilizers, which can promote lush growth susceptible to rot.
