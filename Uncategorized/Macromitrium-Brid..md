## Care Guide
Macromitrium moss thrives in consistently humid environments with indirect light, mimicking its native forest habitat. Ensure regular moisture without waterlogging and provide very minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient requirements. Fertilization is generally unnecessary; if used, a highly diluted moss-specific or general liquid fertilizer once or twice a year would suffice.
