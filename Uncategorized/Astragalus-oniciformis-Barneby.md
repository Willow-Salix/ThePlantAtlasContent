| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South-central Idaho, USA (specifically Blaine and Custer counties) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Steppe / Semi-arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure throughout the day, characteristic of its open, treeless native sagebrush steppe habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering is essential; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. This species is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to root rot if overwatered, reflecting its adaptation to dry native conditions. |

## Care Guide
Picabo Milkvetch thrives in conditions mimicking its native semi-arid habitat, requiring full sun and very infrequent watering. It is highly drought-tolerant and prefers lean, well-draining soil with little to no supplemental fertilizer, making overwatering and rich soils its main threats.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is needed. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. If grown in very poor soil, a very diluted, low-nitrogen fertilizer might be applied once annually in spring, but generally it thrives in lean, well-drained soils.
