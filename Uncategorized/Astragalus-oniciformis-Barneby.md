# Picabo Milkvetch

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Picabo Milkvetch thrives in conditions mimicking its native semi-arid habitat, requiring full sun and very infrequent watering. It is highly drought-tolerant and prefers lean, well-draining soil with little to no supplemental fertilizer, making overwatering and rich soils its main threats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is needed. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. If grown in very poor soil, a very diluted, low-nitrogen fertilizer might be applied once annually in spring, but generally it thrives in lean, well-drained soils.
