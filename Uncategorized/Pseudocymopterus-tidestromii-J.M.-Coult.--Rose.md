# Tidestrom's False Springparsley

*Pseudocymopterus tidestromii J.M. Coult. & Rose* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (e.g., Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming) |
| **Climate** | Montane to Subalpine Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, reflecting its exposure on rocky slopes and open woodlands. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; thrives in dry conditions. Water deeply when the topsoil is dry, then allow it to dry out completely before the next watering, mimicking seasonal precipitation patterns. |

## Care Guide
This resilient montane plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained, rocky soils, reflecting its arid native habitat. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established. Fertilization is generally not needed.

### Fertilizer
Low; native to rocky, often nutrient-poor soils. Fertilization is rarely needed; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring if soil is exceptionally poor.
