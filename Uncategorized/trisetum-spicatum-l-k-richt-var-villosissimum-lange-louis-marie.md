## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal: Arctic and subarctic regions of North America (including Greenland, Canada, Alaska), Eurasia, and high altitudes in the Andes of South America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. Thrives in bright, direct light, reflecting its exposed native habitat above the treeline or in open arctic plains. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to low water. Water regularly during its active growing season, but ensure excellent drainage and allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings, mimicking snowmelt followed by periods of drier conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Trisetum is a genus of plants in the grass family, widespread in temperate, subarctic, and alpine habitats in much of the world. Oatgrass is a common name for plants in this genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cold-hardy grass is best suited for full sun exposure and well-drained, infertile soils, replicating its alpine and arctic tundra environment. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly to maintain its natural vigor and prevent overgrowth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer. Native soils are typically nutrient-poor. Apply a very diluted, balanced fertilizer once a year, or none if planted in rich enough soil, to avoid over-fertilization.
