| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean region (Southern Europe and Northwest Africa), specifically countries like Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Morocco. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it thrives in the open, bright conditions of its native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; allow the soil surface to dry out between waterings. More frequent watering may be needed during hot, dry summer periods to support active growth and flowering, mirroring its native dry summers after spring rains. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dwarf morning-glory thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its Mediterranean origin. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between waterings, and use a light hand with fertilizer to promote abundant flowering. These conditions mimic its native hot, sunny, and somewhat drier environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied monthly during the growing season to encourage blooming in cultivation, as native Mediterranean soils are not typically overly rich.
