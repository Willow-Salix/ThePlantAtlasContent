## Introduction
Ophioglossum, the adder's-tongue ferns, is a genus of about 50 species of ferns in the family Ophioglossaceae. The genus name comes from Ancient Greek ὄφις (óphis), meaning "snake", and γλῶσσα (glôssa), meaning "tongue". Their cosmopolitan distribution is mainly in tropical and subtropical habitats.
The genus has the largest number of chromosomes in the known plant kingdom, but contrary to popular belief does not have the largest number of chromosomes out of all known organisms, falling short to the protist Sterkiella histriomuscorum.

## Care Guide
Northern Adderstongue thrives in temperate conditions, preferring partial to dappled sunlight and consistently moist soil. It is a light feeder, requiring minimal fertilization during its active growth period. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot while maintaining moisture.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; use a very dilute balanced liquid fertilizer once or twice during the growing season.
