## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern North America (including Eastern Canada, Northeastern USA, Greenland) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subarctic |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires bright, direct light for most of the day, typical of open alpine or arctic environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; prefers consistently moist but very well-drained soil, mimicking the meltwater and rocky conditions of its native habitat. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
Fernald's Willow thrives in full sun and cold, exposed conditions, reflecting its alpine tundra origins. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and has minimal needs for fertilization, adapted to its naturally lean native environment.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Minimal or no fertilization is typically needed. If desired, a very diluted, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring might be applied.
