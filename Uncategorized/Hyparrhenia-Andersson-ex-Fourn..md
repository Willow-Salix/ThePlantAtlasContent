## Introduction
Hyparrhenia is a genus of grasses. Many species are known commonly as thatching grass.
They are mostly native to tropical Africa; some can be found in warmer areas in temperate Eurasia, Australia, and Latin America. These are annual and perennial bunch grasses. The inflorescence branches into twin spikes of paired spikelets.

## Care Guide
Thatching Grass (Hyparrhenia) thrives in full sun, characteristic of its African savanna origin. It requires moderate to high watering during its active growth but is highly drought-tolerant. Moderate fertilization supports its vigorous development in various soil types.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization during its growth phase to support vigorous development. It can tolerate poor to moderately fertile soils.
