## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Central and South America (ranging from Mexico to Brazil and the Caribbean) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest / Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. As lianas, they often grow in the understory but seek out brighter conditions, so avoid harsh, direct afternoon sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Keep the soil consistently moist but never waterlogged, mimicking continuous tropical rainfall with good drainage. Allow the top inch to dry slightly before rewatering, and maintain high humidity. |

## Introduction
Hiraea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malpighiaceae. The genus Hiraea comprises over 55 species of woody vines and shrubs found in diverse habitats, except very dry vegetation types, in the New World tropics and subtropics from western Mexico to Paraguay and adjacent Argentina and south-eastern Brazil; it also occurs in the Lesser Antilles in Grenada and St. Lucia.
Hiraea faginea and H. fagifolia are among the most widespread species. Hiraea perplexa of Ecuador is included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

## Care Guide
Hiraea plants require conditions similar to their native tropical moist forests: warm temperatures, high humidity, and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and feed regularly during the growing season to support their vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring through fall) with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer, reflecting the rapid nutrient cycling of tropical forest soils.
