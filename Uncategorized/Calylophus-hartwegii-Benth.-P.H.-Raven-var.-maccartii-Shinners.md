## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Texas, New Mexico, Arizona) and northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland/Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun. As a plant of open, exposed arid environments, it thrives in direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, Deep Watering. Native to dry climates, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic natural rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Oenothera is a genus of about 145 species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas. It is the type genus of the family Onagraceae.  Common names include evening primrose, suncups, and sundrops. They are not closely related to the true primroses (genus Primula).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native arid and semi-arid scrublands. It requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and benefits from lean soils with minimal fertilization. Mimicking its natural environment with ample sunlight and good drainage is key to its success.

### Fertilizer
Low to No Fertilizer. Plants in arid regions often grow in lean soils; excessive fertilization can harm rather than help.
