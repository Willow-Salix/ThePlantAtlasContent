## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Levant region (Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan), extending into parts of Turkey and Iraq |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean/Semi-arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) to ensure robust growth and flowering, mirroring its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during active growth, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings. It is adapted to summer drought conditions, so reduce watering significantly or cease entirely during periods of dormancy or extreme heat. |

## Introduction
Lathyrus  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae, and contains approximately 160 species. Commonly known as peavines or vetchlings, they are native to temperate areas, with a breakdown of 52 species in Europe, 30 species in North America, 78 in Asia, 24 in tropical East Africa, and 24 in temperate South America. There are annual and perennial species which may be climbing or bushy.  This genus has numerous sections, including Orobus, which was once a separate genus. The genus has numerous synonyms, including Pisum, the ancient Latin name for the pea.

## Care Guide
The Syrian pea thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its Mediterranean habitat. Water moderately during its active growing season, allowing the soil to dry completely between applications, and reduce watering significantly during its summer dormancy. Given its nitrogen-fixing ability, it requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it is a nitrogen-fixer, meaning it enriches the soil with nitrogen. Supplemental nitrogen fertilizer is generally not required; a balanced, low-dose fertilizer or compost can be applied sparingly if soil appears poor.
