## Care Guide
This temperate moss thrives in a consistently moist, humid environment with partial sun to partial shade. It requires minimal to no fertilization and good drainage to prevent waterlogging, mimicking its natural habitat on rocks and soil in Japan.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Mosses are not heavy feeders and can extract sufficient nutrients from their substrate and environment; if used, apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer rarely.
