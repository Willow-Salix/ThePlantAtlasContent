## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian native variety thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering. It adapts well to various soil types and has low fertilization needs, making it a resilient and low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
