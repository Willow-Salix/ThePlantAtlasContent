## Introduction
Loeselia is a genus of flowering plants in the phlox family Polemoniaceae, native to the southwestern United States, Mexico, Central America, Columbia and Venezuela.

## Care Guide
Loeselia scariosa thrives in bright, direct sunlight and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. It prefers well-drained soil and benefits from light fertilization during its active growing period for best performance.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer) is sufficient; avoid heavy fertilization.
