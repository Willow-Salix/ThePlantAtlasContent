## Introduction
Lechea (pinweed) is a genus in the family Cistaceae of the order Malvales. The genus contains about 18 species referred to as "pinweeds" primarily in eastern North America. Most are low-growing herbs with narrow leaves and many small flowers that resemble pinheads.
Linnaeus named the genus Lechea for Swedish botanist Johan Leche (1704–1764), who taught in Finland and is regarded as the father of Finnish meteorology and space research, based on his documentation of the northern lights and early measurements of air temperature in collaboration with Anders Celsius.

## Care Guide
This plant is adapted to dry, sunny environments with lean, well-draining soil, making it very low maintenance. Provide full to partial sun and water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Minimal to no fertilization is needed.
