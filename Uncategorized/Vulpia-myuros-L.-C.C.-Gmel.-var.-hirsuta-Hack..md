## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eurasia and North Africa, particularly the Mediterranean Basin |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean and Temperate Grasslands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and seed production. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Highly drought tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry summers. Water occasionally during prolonged dry periods, but allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Vulpia is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family, native to many countries around the world and naturalized in many of the nations to which it is not native. It is most common in temperate regions.
Vulpia is a part of a group of species known as fescues; Vulpia is sometimes considered a subset of the main fescue genus, Festuca. Many of these fescues are considered noxious weeds in many places. Vulpia myuros is a notable weed.
The genus is named for Johann Samuel Vulpius (1760-1846), a German botanist.

## Care Guide
This adaptable grass thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, demonstrating strong drought tolerance typical of its native Mediterranean climate. It requires minimal watering and no specific fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low. This species is adapted to poor or disturbed soils and generally does not require fertilization. Excessive nutrients can promote leggy growth.
