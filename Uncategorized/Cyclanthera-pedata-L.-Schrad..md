## Care Guide
Cyclanthera pedata thrives in conditions mimicking its native Tropical Montane Forest environment, requiring partial sun to bright indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide regular fertilization during its active growth and fruiting stages to support its vigorous vining and fruit production, and ideally offer high humidity.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to heavy feeder; fertilize regularly during the growing season (spring through fall) with a balanced fertilizer, especially when flowering and fruiting.
