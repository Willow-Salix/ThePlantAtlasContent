## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically alpine and subalpine regions of Washington and Oregon, USA |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, typical of open, high-altitude environments above or near the tree line. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the well-draining soil to dry between applications. Mimic snowmelt followed by drier periods. Drought tolerant once established. |

## Introduction
Draba is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, commonly known as whitlow-grasses (though they are not related to the true grasses).

## Care Guide
Thompson's Draba is an alpine plant requiring full sun and exceptionally well-draining soil to mimic its native rocky, high-altitude habitat. Water moderately during its growing period, but avoid overwatering, and fertilize very sparingly to maintain its compact, hardy form.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Alpine plants thrive in lean, poor soils; excessive nutrients can harm their compact growth habit.
