## Care Guide
This variety of Prickly Currant thrives in cool, moist, and partially shaded environments typical of its native Western North American montane forests. Provide consistently moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter, and protect it from intense afternoon sun. Minimal fertilization is needed, focusing on organic amendments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from organic matter enrichment in the soil rather than heavy synthetic fertilizers, mimicking forest floor decomposition.
