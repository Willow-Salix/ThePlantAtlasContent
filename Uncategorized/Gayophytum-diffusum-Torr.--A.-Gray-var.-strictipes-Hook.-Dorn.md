## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (including British Columbia, California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers open, brightly lit environments, mirroring its native meadows and open woodland edges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Allow soil to dry slightly between waterings. While it tolerates some drought once established, consistent moisture during its active growth period, particularly in spring, is beneficial. |

## Introduction
Gayophytum is a genus of annual herbs in the evening primrose family known commonly as groundsmoke. There are about nine species of groundsmoke, most of which are native to western North America. These are erect flowering herbs generally well under a metre in height and with narrow leaves. They produce white flowers which fade to pink or red.
Species include:

Gayophytum decipiens - deceptive groundsmoke
Gayophytum diffusum - spreading groundsmoke
Gayophytum eriospermum - Coville's groundsmoke
Gayophytum heterozygum - zigzag groundsmoke
Gayophytum humile - dwarf groundsmoke

## Care Guide
This Western North American native thrives in full to partial sun, mimicking its natural open woodland and meadow habitats. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and is relatively undemanding regarding soil fertility, tolerating average to poor soils. Overall, it's a hardy plant preferring well-drained conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. This plant is adapted to average to poor soils and typically does not require rich amendments. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient if growth appears weak, otherwise generally not critical.
