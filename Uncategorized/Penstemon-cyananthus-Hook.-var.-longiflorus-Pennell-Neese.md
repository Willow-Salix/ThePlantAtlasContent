## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (primarily Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado) |
| **Climate** | Arid to semi-arid montane and subalpine regions, Mountain Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its natural exposure in open mountain environments. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate watering; drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings, mimicking sporadic rainfall in arid mountain areas. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This Penstemon thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, mirroring its native mountain environment. It requires low to moderate watering, as it is drought-tolerant once established. Avoid over-fertilization to ensure robust growth and prolific blooming.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils typical of its native habitat. Rich soils or excessive fertilizer can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
