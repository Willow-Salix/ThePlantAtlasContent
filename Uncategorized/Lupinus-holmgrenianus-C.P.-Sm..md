## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Holmgren's Lupine thrives in full sun and dry conditions, mirroring its native arid scrubland habitat. Provide it with ample sunlight and water infrequently but deeply, ensuring the soil dries out completely. Avoid over-fertilizing, particularly with nitrogen, as it's adapted to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required, especially nitrogen, due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities and adaptation to lean, arid soils.
