## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil typical of its native Texas grasslands. Provide consistent moisture, especially during dry spells, and a light feeding to support its vibrant blooms. Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season is beneficial, but avoid over-fertilizing which can reduce blooms.
