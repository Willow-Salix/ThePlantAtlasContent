## 🧤 Care Instructions
Aerva is a robust, drought-tolerant plant thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. Mimic its arid native climate by providing infrequent watering and minimal fertilization. Ensure it receives ample sunlight to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and does not require rich substrate.
