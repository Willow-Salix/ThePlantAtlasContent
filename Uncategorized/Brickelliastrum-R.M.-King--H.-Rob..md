## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, California) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid and Semi-Arid Scrubland, Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun; thrives with high light exposure typical of open desert environments. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering; allow soil to dry completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant due to adaptation to arid conditions. |

## Introduction
Brickellia is a North American genus of about 100 to 110 species of plants in the family Asteraceae, known commonly as brickellbushes. They are found in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central America.  Many species are native to the American southwest, especially Texas. Brickellia is among the more basal lineages of the Eupatorieae and should not be assigned to a subtribe pending further research.
They are mostly woody perennial shrubs. Some species have a very strong pleasant scent, while others smell distasteful. All contain high amounts of essential oils. Germacrene D, a natural insecticide, is found in B. veronicifolia and probably other species, if not all.
Despite their chemical defenses, brickellbushes are food for caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera. These include the noctuid moths Schinia trifascia, Schinia oleagina, which is known only from Brickellia, Schinia buta, which is only known from B. californica, and Schinia gracilenta, which is only known from B. eupatorioides.
The genus is named for John Brickell, 1748–1809, Irish-born physician and naturalist.

## Care Guide
Brickellbush thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrublands, requiring full sun and very well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is highly drought-tolerant, necessitating infrequent but deep watering, and generally needs minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal; adapted to lean, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
