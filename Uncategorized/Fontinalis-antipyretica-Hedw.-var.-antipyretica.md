## Care Guide
This aquatic moss requires constant submersion in clean, cool, and oxygenated freshwater with moderate to low light exposure. It has very low nutrient needs, primarily absorbing what it requires from the water, and benefits from avoiding direct, intense sunlight.

### Fertilizer
Very low; absorbs necessary nutrients directly from the water column. Excessive fertilization should be avoided to prevent algae blooms.
