## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |

| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (including Eastern Canada and the Northeastern and Midwestern United States, especially the Appalachian Mountains) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest (cool, moist, shaded understory) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade. Thrives in dappled sunlight typical of a forest floor, especially in early spring before the tree canopy fully develops. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, well-draining soil, particularly during its active growth in spring. Avoid waterlogging. Requires less water when dormant in summer. |

## Introduction
Cardamine is a large genus of flowering plants in the mustard family, Brassicaceae, known as bittercresses and toothworts. It contains more than 200 species of annuals and perennials. Species in this genus can be found in diverse habitats worldwide, except the Antarctic.  The name Cardamine is derived from the Greek kardaminē, water cress, from kardamon, pepper grass.

## Care Guide
This woodland ephemeral flourishes in cool, moist, shaded conditions with nutrient-rich, well-draining soil. Ensure consistent moisture during its spring growth phase, mimicking its native forest floor habitat, and enrich the soil with organic matter.

### Fertilizer
Prefers rich, organic, humus-filled soil. Benefits from light annual fertilization with compost or a balanced organic fertilizer in early spring.
