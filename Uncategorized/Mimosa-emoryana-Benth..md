## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in exposed desert environments. |
| **Watering** | Low; drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking infrequent desert rainfall patterns. Overwatering can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Mimosa is a genus of about 600 species of herbs and shrubs, in the mimosoid clade of the legume family Fabaceae. Species are native to the Americas, from North Dakota to northern Argentina, and to eastern Africa (Tanzania, Mozambique, and Madagascar) as well as the Indian subcontinent and Indochina. The generic name is derived from the Greek word μῖμος (mimos), 'actor' or 'mime', and the feminine suffix -osa, 'resembling', suggesting its 'sensitive leaves' which seem to 'mimic conscious life'.
Two species in the genus are especially notable. One is Mimosa pudica, commonly known as touch-me-not, which folds its leaves when touched or exposed to heat. It is native to southern Central and South America but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value, both as a houseplant in temperate areas, and outdoors in the tropics. Outdoor cultivation has led to weedy invasion in some areas, notably Hawaii. The other is Mimosa tenuiflora, which is best known for its use in shamanic ayahuasca brews due to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine found in its root bark.

## Care Guide
Emory's Mimosa requires full sun and thrives in well-draining soil with infrequent watering, reflecting its native arid scrubland habitat. Being a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has minimal fertilizer needs. Mimicking its desert origins will ensure its health and vitality.

### Fertilizer
Low; as a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen. Fertilization is generally not required, or a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring if growth is poor.
