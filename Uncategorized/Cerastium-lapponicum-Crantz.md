## 🌱 Overview
Cerastium is a genus of annual, winter annual, or perennial flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. They are commonly called mouse-ears or mouse-ear chickweeds. There are 214 accepted species, found nearly worldwide but with the greatest concentration in the northern temperate regions. A number of the species are common weeds in fields and on disturbed ground.

Cerastium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora chalcogrammella (which feeds exclusively on Cerastium arvense) and Coleophora striatipennella (which has been recorded on Cerastium fontanum).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cold-hardy plant requires a bright, open location with full to partial sun. Ensure consistent soil moisture through regular, moderate watering, but always allow for good drainage. It thrives in lean soils and has very low fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance choice for suitable climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Naturally grows in nutrient-poor, thin tundra soils. If grown in containers or very poor soil, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring, but generally not necessary.
