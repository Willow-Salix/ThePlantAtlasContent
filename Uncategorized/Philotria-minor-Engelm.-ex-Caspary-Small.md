## Care Guide
Watershield is an aquatic plant that thrives in full sun and constant water submersion. Ensure a nutrient-rich substrate, supplementing with aquatic fertilizers during the growing season for robust health. It requires minimal care once established in suitable pond or container conditions.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from aquatic plant fertilizer tabs pressed into the substrate every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season, or a naturally rich, muddy bottom.
