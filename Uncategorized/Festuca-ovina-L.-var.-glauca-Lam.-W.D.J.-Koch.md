## Care Guide
Blue Fescue is a low-maintenance grass best suited for sunny, well-drained locations, mimicking its native European dry grasslands. It requires minimal watering once established and generally does not need fertilization. Provide ample sunlight to encourage its characteristic blue-gray foliage and dense form.

### Fertilizer
Low, thrives in lean to poor soils; excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced vigor.
