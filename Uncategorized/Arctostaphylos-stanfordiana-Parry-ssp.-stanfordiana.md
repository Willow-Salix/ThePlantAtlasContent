## Introduction
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## Care Guide
Stanford's manzanita is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub best suited for full sun to partial shade. It requires very little water once established, thriving in the dry summers characteristic of its native Mediterranean climate. Avoid excessive fertilization, especially with high-phosphorus products, as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required; sensitive to high phosphorus levels and thrives in lean, well-draining soils.
