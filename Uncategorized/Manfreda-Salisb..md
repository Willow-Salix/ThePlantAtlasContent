| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico |

| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal flowering, tolerating some afternoon shade in extremely hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate during the active growing season (summer), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Significantly reduce or cease watering during the winter dormancy period to prevent bulb rot. Requires excellent drainage. |

## Care Guide
Tuberose, native to Mexico's subtropical dry forests and scrublands, thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Water moderately during its summer growth phase, ensuring the soil dries out completely between waterings, and keep it dry during winter dormancy. Fertilize lightly during the growing season for best flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Apply a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer sparingly once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer). Avoid over-fertilizing.
