# Pochote

*Ceiba aesculifolia (Kunth) Britten & Baker f.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico (from Jalisco south to Chiapas) and Central America (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest, Thorn Scrub, and Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun is essential for robust growth, replicating its natural habitat in open, exposed areas of dry forests and savannas. |
| **Watering** | Water regularly during its active growing season (typically spring and summer), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal to no water during its dormant dry season. |

## Care Guide
Pochote requires full sun and a distinct wet-dry watering cycle, thriving with regular water during growth but tolerating significant drought when dormant. Provide moderate fertilization in well-draining soil to mimic its tropical dry forest origins.

### Fertilizer
Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season. Over-fertilization is generally not necessary, as it is adapted to moderately fertile soils.
