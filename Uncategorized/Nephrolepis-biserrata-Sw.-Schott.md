## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pantropical (e.g., Central and South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia, Pacific Islands) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforests and Moist Tropical Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial to full shade; bright, indirect light is ideal. Direct sun exposure can scorch its fronds, typical of an understory plant. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, reflecting its native habitat's high rainfall and humidity. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Nephrolepis is a genus of about 30 species of ferns. It is the only genus in the family Nephrolepidaceae, placed in the suborder Aspleniineae (eupolypods I) of the order Polypodiales in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). (It is placed in the Dryopteridaceae in some other classifications.) Species in this genus include plants commonly referred to as Boston ferns. The fronds are long and narrow, and once-pinnate, in the case of one Bornean species reaching thirty feet (nine meters) in length.

## Care Guide
The Giant Swordfern flourishes in environments that replicate its tropical rainforest origins. Provide bright, indirect light or shade, maintain consistently moist soil, and ensure high humidity. Fertilize lightly during active growth to support its robust fronds.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeder. Fertilize sparingly during the growing season (spring to early autumn) with a diluted liquid fertilizer, perhaps every 4-6 weeks. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
