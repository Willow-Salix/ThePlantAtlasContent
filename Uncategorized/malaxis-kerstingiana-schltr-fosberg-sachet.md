## 🧤 Care Instructions
This terrestrial orchid requires consistent moisture and high humidity, typical of its native tropical rainforest environment. Provide low to medium indirect light and ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Fertilize regularly with a weak orchid-specific solution during active growth.
