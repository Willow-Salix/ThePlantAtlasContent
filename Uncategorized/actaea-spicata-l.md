## 🧤 Care Instructions
Eurasian Baneberry thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate woodland understory. It requires consistent shade or partial shade, along with continuously moist, well-drained soil. Provide moderate nutrients, ideally from organic matter, to support its growth without over-fertilizing.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from an annual application of organic compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially in poorer soils. Excessive fertilization is generally not needed.
