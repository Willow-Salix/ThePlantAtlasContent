## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America, particularly the Midwestern United States |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth, though young trees can tolerate some partial shade. |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent watering, especially during dry periods and for young trees. Established trees are somewhat drought-tolerant but perform best with regular moisture; allow soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Hickory is a common name for trees composing the genus Carya, which includes 19 species accepted by Plants of the World Online.
Seven species are native to southeast Asia in China, Indochina, and northeastern India (Assam), and twelve are native to North America. A number of hickory species are used for their edible nuts or for their wood.

## Care Guide
Native to the temperate deciduous forests of Eastern and Central North America, the Hybrid Hickory thrives in full sun and rich, well-draining soils. It requires moderate, consistent watering, especially when young, and benefits from organic matter to meet its nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Moderate nutrient needs. A balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied, especially for young or struggling trees. Established trees benefit from organic matter (e.g., compost) in the soil.
