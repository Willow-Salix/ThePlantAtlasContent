## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Azure Penstemon thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native habitat of dry slopes and open forests in California and Oregon. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent, deep watering. Avoid excessive fertilization, as it prefers lean conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soil. Avoid over-fertilization, which can harm native plants. A light, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly in spring, if at all.
