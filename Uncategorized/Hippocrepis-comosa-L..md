## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western and Central Europe, including the UK, extending to parts of North Africa and Western Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland (specifically chalk/calcareous grasslands) |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and flowering, reflecting its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Prefers well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant once established. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic its native drier grassland conditions. |

## Care Guide
Horseshoe Vetch thrives in full sun and well-drained, alkaline soils, characteristic of its native chalk grasslands. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications. Minimal or no fertilizer is needed due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile, alkaline soils. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, therefore, minimal to no additional fertilizer is needed, and high-nitrogen feeds should be avoided.
