## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and central North America (primarily eastern and southeastern United States) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Shrubland, specifically dry, sandy environments like coastal dunes, sandhills, and pine barrens. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open, unshaded native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering. Highly drought-tolerant once established, thriving in well-drained, dry sandy soils. Water deeply but rarely, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Care Guide
Purple Sandgrass is a low-maintenance plant ideal for dry, sunny locations with poor soil. It thrives with full sun and very infrequent watering, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or sandy garden beds where other plants struggle.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Native to nutrient-poor sandy soils, it requires minimal to no fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
