## Introduction
Bidens is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. The genus include roughly 230 species which are distributed worldwide. Despite their global distribution, the systematics and taxonomy of the genus has been described as complicated and unorganized. The common names beggarticks, black jack, burr marigolds, cobbler's pegs, Spanish needles, stickseeds, tickseeds and tickseed sunflowers refer to the fruits of the plants, most of which are bristly and barbed. The generic name refers to the same character; Bidens comes from the Latin bi ("two") and dens ("tooth").

## Care Guide
Leafy Beggarticks thrive in conditions mimicking their native temperate wetlands, requiring full to partial sun and constantly moist to wet soil. Ensure it never dries out and provide moderate fertility for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility, as native wetland soils are often rich in organic matter. A balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
