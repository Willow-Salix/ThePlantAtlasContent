## Introduction
Pitcairnia is a genus of plants in the family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Pitcairnioideae. It was named after William Pitcairn, Scottish physician and gardener (1711–1791). Pitcairnia ranks as the second most species-rich genus in the family Bromeliaceae, after Tillandsia. They are most abundant in Colombia, Peru and Brazil, but can also be found in areas from Cuba and Mexico south to Argentina. One species, Pitcairnia feliciana, is found in tropical West Africa, and is the only member of the family Bromeliaceae not native to the Americas.
Almost all Pitcairnias are terrestrial or saxicolous, and prefer moist areas. However, many are found growing epiphytically in trees.

## Care Guide
Pitcairnia thrives in bright, indirect light to partial sun and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide regular humidity and light fertilization during active growth to mimic its native tropical and subtropical humid environments.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the growing season (spring/summer) with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/2 strength).
