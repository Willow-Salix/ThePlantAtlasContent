## Care Guide
Arizona Wheatgrass is a robust, drought-tolerant perennial grass native to the semi-arid grasslands of the Southwestern US. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal watering once established. This makes it an excellent, low-maintenance choice for xeriscaping or native plant gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. Supplemental fertilizer is generally not required.
