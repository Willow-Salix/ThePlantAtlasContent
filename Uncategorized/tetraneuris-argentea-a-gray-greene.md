## 🌱 Overview
Tetraneuris, commonly known as four-nerve daisy or bitterweed, is a genus of North American plants in the sneezeweed tribe within the daisy family.
The genus includes one annual species, Tetraneuris linearifolia, with all the other species being perennials.
The name is of Greek origin, deriving from tetra, meaning "four", and neuron, meaning "nerve", which refers to the venation of the rays: three-lobed with the outer lobes themselves having an apparent vein down the middle.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Perky Sue thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native arid montane environments. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and generally needs minimal to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean, well-draining soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary, or a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly once in early spring.
