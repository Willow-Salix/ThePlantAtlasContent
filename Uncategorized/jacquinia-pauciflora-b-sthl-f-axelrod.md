## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical scrubland native thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions to mimic its native wet and dry seasons. Fertilize lightly during the growing period, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season is sufficient. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
