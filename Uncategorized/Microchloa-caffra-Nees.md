## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and Southern Africa (e.g., South Africa, Kenya, Zimbabwe), extending to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of India. |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid to Subtropical Grasslands and Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires at least 6 hours of bright, direct sunlight daily for optimal growth. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Mimic seasonal rainfall patterns, reducing water during cooler, dormant periods. |

## Care Guide
Pincushion Grass thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native semi-arid grassland and savanna habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent yet deep watering once the soil has dried out completely. Minimal fertilization is needed for this resilient grass.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This grass is adapted to naturally less fertile soils. A light, balanced granular fertilizer can be applied once in early spring, but often isn't essential for vigorous growth.
