## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pincushion Grass thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native semi-arid grassland and savanna habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent yet deep watering once the soil has dried out completely. Minimal fertilization is needed for this resilient grass.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This grass is adapted to naturally less fertile soils. A light, balanced granular fertilizer can be applied once in early spring, but often isn't essential for vigorous growth.
