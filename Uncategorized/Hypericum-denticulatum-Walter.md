| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (from Virginia south to Florida, west to Texas and Oklahoma, and north into the Ohio Valley) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Wetland (specifically wet meadows, bogs, and ditches within a humid subtropical zone) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day is ideal, but tolerates some afternoon shade) |

## 🌱 Overview
Hypericum  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Hypericaceae (formerly considered a subfamily of Clusiaceae).  The genus has a nearly worldwide distribution, missing only from tropical lowlands, deserts and polar regions. Many Hypericum species are regarded as invasive species and noxious weeds.  All members of the genus may be referred to as St. John's wort, and some are known as goatweed. The white or pink flowered marsh St. John's worts of North America and eastern Asia are generally accepted as belonging to the separate genus Triadenum Raf.
Hypericum is unusual for a genus of its size because a worldwide taxonomic monograph was produced for it by Norman Robson (working at the Natural History Museum, London). Robson recognizes 36 sections within Hypericum.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, consistently wet conditions, mimicking its native bog and wet meadow habitats. Ensure high moisture levels and adequate sunlight, while providing only minimal fertilization. It is well-suited for rain gardens or moist garden beds.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typical wetland soils are not overly rich. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is generally sufficient, or none if soil is already organic-rich.
