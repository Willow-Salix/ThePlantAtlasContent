## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (specifically California, including the San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains) |
| **Climate** | Montane/Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in exposed, high-elevation areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the well-drained soil to dry out between applications, mimicking its native habitat's snowmelt and summer rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
Ewan's Paintbrush thrives in full sun and requires well-drained, lean soils, typical of its high-elevation montane habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions. Due to its hemiparasitic nature, fertilizer needs are minimal or met via host plants.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a hemiparasitic plant, it typically draws nutrients from host plants in its natural environment, so rich fertilization is generally not needed.
