| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers ample direct light for best growth, tolerating intense sun in its native range. |
| **Watering** | Regular and consistent watering during the wet/growing season; highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring significantly less water during dry periods. |

## Introduction
Gliricidia sepium, often simply referred to as gliricidia or by its Spanish common name madre de cacao (calque of Nahuatl cacahuanāntli; also anglicized as mother of cocoa), is a medium size leguminous tree belonging to the family Fabaceae.  It is an important multi-purpose legume tree, with a native range from Mexico to Colombia, but now widely introduced to other tropical zones.

## Care Guide
Quickstick thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical dry forest environment, preferring full sun to partial shade and ample light. It requires regular watering during its active growing season but is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing significantly less water during dry periods. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, its fertilizer needs are generally low.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. Occasional balanced fertilizer can support vigorous growth, especially in nutrient-poor soils.
