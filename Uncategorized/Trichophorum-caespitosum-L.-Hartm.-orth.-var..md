## Care Guide
This plant thrives in very wet, acidic, and nutrient-poor conditions, mimicking its native bog and moorland habitat. Provide full sun and ensure the soil remains consistently waterlogged, never allowing it to dry out. Fertilization should be minimal to none.

### Fertilizer
Very low; native bog environments are nutrient-poor. Minimal to no fertilization is needed.
