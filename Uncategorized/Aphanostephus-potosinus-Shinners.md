## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Potosi Dozedaisy thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid to semi-arid environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and minimize fertilization as it is adapted to lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; these plants are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils characteristic of arid regions, requiring minimal supplemental feeding.
