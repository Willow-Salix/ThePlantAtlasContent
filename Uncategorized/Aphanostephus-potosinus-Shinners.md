| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Grassland and Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with its native open, exposed environments. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking the sparse rainfall patterns of its native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant. |

## Care Guide
The Potosi Dozedaisy thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid to semi-arid environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and minimize fertilization as it is adapted to lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; these plants are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils characteristic of arid regions, requiring minimal supplemental feeding.
