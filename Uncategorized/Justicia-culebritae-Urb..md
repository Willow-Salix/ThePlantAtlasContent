## Care Guide
The Culebrita Island Water-Willow requires full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its tropical coastal origins. While it enjoys moisture, it's adapted to periods of relative dryness, so avoid overwatering. Provide moderate fertilization during its active growth phases.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength, applied monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer) is generally sufficient.
