| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily). Thrives in open, exposed environments. |
| **Watering** | Very low. Highly drought-tolerant once established. Requires excellent drainage and should not be overwatered, especially during warmer months. Prefers dry conditions similar to its native summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Chorizanthe is a genus of plants in the buckwheat family known generally as spineflowers. These are small, squat, herbaceous plants with spiny-looking inflorescences of flowers. The flowers may be in shades of red or yellow to white. The bracts are pointed and sometimes tipped with a hooked awn, and the inflorescence often dries into a rounded, spiny husk. Spineflowers are found in western North America and South America.
Name derivation: The word Chorizanthe comes from the Greek roots chorizo and anthos meaning "to divide," and "flower," thus meaning "divided flowers," but actually used in reference to the divided calyx.

## Care Guide
The Monterey Spineflower requires full sun and exceptionally well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its native coastal California habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing very little water once established, and should be protected from overwatering, especially in summer. Fertilization is typically unnecessary and can be detrimental to this species adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Fertilization is generally not recommended and can be harmful, promoting excessive vegetative growth at the expense of flowering.
