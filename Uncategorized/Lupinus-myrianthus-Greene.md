| **Climate** | Montane Forest and Meadow (Mediterranean-influenced) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), tolerating some partial afternoon shade in hot climates. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
The Many-flowered Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring moderate moisture during its active growth in spring and early summer. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has low fertilizer needs, making it suitable for recreating a montane environment in a garden setting.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil and does not require nitrogen-rich fertilizers; excessive nitrogen can hinder flowering. A light application of phosphorus and potassium may be beneficial in very poor soils.
