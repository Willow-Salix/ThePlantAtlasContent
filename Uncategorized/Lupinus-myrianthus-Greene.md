## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Many-flowered Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring moderate moisture during its active growth in spring and early summer. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has low fertilizer needs, making it suitable for recreating a montane environment in a garden setting.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil and does not require nitrogen-rich fertilizers; excessive nitrogen can hinder flowering. A light application of phosphorus and potassium may be beneficial in very poor soils.
