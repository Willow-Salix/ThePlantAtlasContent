## Introduction
Graphina is a genus of script lichens in the family Graphidaceae. It has about 25 species. The genus was circumscribed in 1880 by Swiss lichenologist Johannes Müller Argoviensis. Müller Argoviensis did not indicate a type species for the genus in his original publication; David Hawksworth proposed to designate Graphina anguina as a lectotype in 1981.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in the humid, warm conditions of tropical rainforests. Provide consistent high humidity, frequent misting or ambient moisture (avoiding standing water), and indirect, dappled light, shielding it from direct sunlight and chemical fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed; obtains nutrients from air and rainwater. Sensitive to atmospheric pollutants.
