## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., Scandinavia, North America) |
| **Climate** | Boreal/Arctic Tundra and Alpine environments |
| **Sunlight** | Tolerant of varying light conditions, from bright, exposed sun to partial shade, reflecting its growth on rocks and bark in high-latitude environments. Adaptable to long periods of light or darkness. |
| **Watering** | Relies on atmospheric moisture from rain, snowmelt, dew, and fog. Does not require soil-based watering and can tolerate prolonged periods of desiccation. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
Caring for Lecidea ornata, a lichen, involves providing a stable, unpolluted environment mirroring its native Arctic/Boreal habitat. It thrives on atmospheric moisture rather than root watering and does not need fertilizers. Ensure it receives appropriate light exposure, tolerating varying conditions characteristic of high-latitude regions.

### Fertilizer
Does not require supplemental fertilization. Highly sensitive to excess nutrients and atmospheric pollutants, which can be detrimental.
