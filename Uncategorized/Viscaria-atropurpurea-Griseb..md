## Introduction
Viscaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae, native to Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Kazakhstan, and western Siberia. Molecular studies attempting to resolve relationships in the tribe Sileneae have found that Viscaria is closely genetically related to the genus Atocion, but is quite distinct from it morphologically.

## Care Guide
Native to the Mediterranean regions of Southeastern Europe, Purple Catchfly thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering during its growth period, becoming tolerant of drier conditions once established. This plant is relatively low-maintenance, needing minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low, generally not a heavy feeder. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil is poor.
