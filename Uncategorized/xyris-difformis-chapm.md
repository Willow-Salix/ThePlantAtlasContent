## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (from Delaware south to Florida and west to Texas and Oklahoma) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Wetlands (specifically bogs, marshes, and wet pinelands) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is ideal for robust growth, though it can tolerate light partial shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently wet to saturated soil conditions, mimicking its natural bog habitat. It should never be allowed to dry out; often grown in standing water or bog gardens. |

## 🌱 Overview
Xyris is a genus of flowering plants, the yelloweyed grasses, in the yellow-eyed-grass family.  The genus counts over 250 species, widespread over much of the world, with the center of distribution in the Guianas.
The leaves are mostly distichous, linear, flat, and thin or round with a conspicuous sheath at the base. They are arranged in a basal aggregation. The small, yellow flowers are borne on a spherical or cylindrical spike or head (inflorescence). Each flower grows from the axil of a leathery bract. The fruit is a nonfleshy, dehiscent capsule.  In Xyris complanata, a single flower bud on the spike appears in the morning, and expands into a conspicuous flower during the afternoon hours.
The APG IV system, of 2016, places the genus in family Xyridaceae, into the order Poales in the clade commelinids, in the monocots.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bog Yelloweyed Grass thrives in full sun and demands continuously wet, acidic soil conditions, characteristic of its native bogs and marshes. Avoid allowing the soil to dry out, and fertilize very minimally due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nutrient requirements. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very dilute, acidic-formulated fertilizer, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor bog soils.
