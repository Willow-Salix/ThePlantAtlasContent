## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, particularly the Northeastern United States and adjacent Canada. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest and Wetland environments (moist woodlands, swamps, wet meadows) |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial shade to dappled sunlight, mimicking its understory and woodland edge habitat. Avoids intense, direct full sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions; replicate its native wetland and moist woodland environment by ensuring the soil never dries out. Can tolerate periodically saturated soil. |

## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
The Roundfruit Sedge thrives in cool, moist conditions reminiscent of its native temperate woodland and wetland habitats. Provide consistently moist to wet soil and partial to dappled sunlight for optimal growth. It has low to moderate fertilizer requirements, benefiting mostly from good soil organic content.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. Benefits from rich organic matter in the soil but generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring if desired.
