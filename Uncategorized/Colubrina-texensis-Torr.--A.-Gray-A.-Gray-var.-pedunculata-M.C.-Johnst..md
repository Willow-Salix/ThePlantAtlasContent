## Care Guide
Texan Hogplum thrives in conditions mirroring its native semi-arid scrublands, requiring full sun exposure and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent, deep watering once established, and tolerates lean soils without much need for fertilization. This makes it an ideal low-maintenance plant for hot, dry, sunny landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; adapts well to poor soils. Light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, if desired, but often not necessary.
