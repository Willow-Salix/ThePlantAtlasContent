## Introduction
Ranunculus sardous is a species of buttercup known by the common name hairy buttercup. It is native to Europe and it can be found in many other areas of the world, including parts of the United States and Australia, as an introduced species and a roadside and lawn weed. It grows in many types of disturbed habitat, especially in moist areas. It is an annual or biennial herb producing a mostly erect, hairy stem up to half a meter tall. The hairy leaves are usually divided into three leaflets which are borne on petioles a few centimeters in length. The flower has usually five yellow petals each up to a centimeter long and five reflexed sepals. The fruit is an achene borne in a spherical cluster of up to 35.

## Care Guide
This buttercup thrives in sunny to partly shaded locations with consistently moist, well-draining soil during its active growth period. Mimicking its native Mediterranean-montane climate, provide regular water in spring and early summer. It requires minimal fertilizer, preferring average to moderately fertile soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Benefits from average to moderately rich soil, especially during its growing season.
