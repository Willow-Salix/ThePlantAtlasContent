## 🌱 Overview
Sporobolus is a nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. The name Sporobolus means "seed-thrower", and is derived from Ancient Greek word σπόρος (spóros), meaning "seed", and the root of βάλλειν (bállein) "to throw", referring to the dispersion of seeds. Members of the genus are usually called dropseeds or sacaton grasses. They are typical prairie and savanna plants, occurring in other types of open habitat in warmer climates. At least one species (S. caespitosus from Saint Helena) is threatened with extinction, and another (S. durus from Ascension Island) is extinct.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in its native subtropical grasslands, Sporobolus Arcuatus requires full sun and moderate watering, tolerating dry spells once established. It benefits from well-drained soil and minimal annual fertilization to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced fertilizer once annually in spring is generally sufficient, particularly in poorer soils.
