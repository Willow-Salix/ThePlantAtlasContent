| **🌍 Origin** | Widely distributed in temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Filtered to partial shade, avoiding intense direct sunlight. Often found on tree bark under a canopy, it prefers consistent, indirect light. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and frequent access to moisture from rain or dew. Should be misted regularly; avoid standing water but ensure the immediate environment is often damp. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rinodina is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 265 species. It is hypothesized that a few saxicolous species common to dry regions of western North America, southern Europe, North Africa and central Asia may date back 240 million years to the Middle Triassic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen thrives in cool, humid conditions with filtered light, typical of temperate forests. Provide high atmospheric moisture through frequent misting and ensure consistent humidity, while protecting it from direct, harsh sun. No conventional fertilizers are required as it naturally absorbs nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization is needed. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from atmospheric dust and rainfall, and from the substrate they grow on.
