| **Native Origin** | Southern Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile (South America) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Grassland/Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun is essential, mirroring its native habitat in open fields and disturbed areas with high light exposure. |

## Introduction
This is about the Verbena bonariensis described by Linnaeus. See also below for a common misapplication of this taxon.

Verbena bonariensis, the purpletop vervain, clustertop vervain, Argentinian vervain, tall verbena  or pretty verbena, is a member of the verbena family cultivated as a flowering annual or herbaceous perennial plant. In United States horticulture, it is also known by the ambiguous names purpletop (also used for the grass Tridens flavus) and South American vervain (which can mean any of the numerous species in the genus Verbena occurring in that continent). For the misapplication "Brazilian verbena" see below.
It is native to tropical South America where it grows throughout most of the warm regions, from Colombia and Brazil to Argentina and Chile.

## Care Guide
To care for Purpletop Vervain, provide full sun exposure, mimicking its open grassland origins. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and apply minimal fertilizer as it thrives in average soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It naturally grows in average to poor soils and does not require rich conditions or heavy fertilization; excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
