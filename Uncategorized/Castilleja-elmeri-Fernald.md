## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
This hemiparasitic plant thrives in its native habitat of well-drained, rocky slopes and subalpine meadows, requiring full sun to partial sun exposure. It needs moderate to low watering and highly prefers excellent drainage, tolerating dry conditions once established. Due to its parasitic nature, avoid heavy fertilization as it draws nutrients from host plants.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; as a hemiparasite, it obtains nutrients from host plants and can be sensitive to high soil fertility.
