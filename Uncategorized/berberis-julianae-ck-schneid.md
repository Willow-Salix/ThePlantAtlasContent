## 🌱 Overview
Berberis (), commonly known as barberry, is a large genus of deciduous and evergreen shrubs from 1–5 m (3+1⁄2–16+1⁄2 ft) tall, found throughout temperate and subtropical regions of the world (apart from Australia). Species diversity is greatest in South America and Asia, but native species also appear in Europe, Africa and North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Wintergreen Barberry thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate montane forest, requiring full sun to partial shade and regular watering in well-drained soil. This robust shrub is generally low-maintenance, needing minimal fertilization once established and exhibiting good drought tolerance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically not essential in average garden soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial in nutrient-poor soils.
