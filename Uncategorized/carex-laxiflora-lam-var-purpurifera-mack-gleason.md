Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This woodland sedge thrives in partial to full shade, mimicking its native understory habitat in temperate forests. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil rich in organic matter. Fertilization is generally minimal, focusing on maintaining soil health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
