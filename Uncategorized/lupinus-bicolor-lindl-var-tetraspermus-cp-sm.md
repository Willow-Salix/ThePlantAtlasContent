## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (primarily California, USA, and Baja California, Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open grassland and chaparral native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the growing season (cooler months), allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. It is adapted to wet winters and dry summers, preferring well-drained soil and disliking waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus bicolor is a species of lupine known as the miniature lupine, Lindley's annual lupine, pigmy-leaved lupine, or bicolor lupine.
It is a showy flowering annual or perennial plant native to western North America, from northwestern Baja California, throughout California, and north to British Columbia. It is found in diverse habitats below 3,000 feet (910 m), including: grasslands; chaparral; oak, mixed conifer and Joshua tree woodlands; coastal sage scrub; and open conifer forests. It often shares habitats with other prolifically blooming spring and early summer wildflowers, including the California poppy.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Miniature Lupine thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean habitat. Provide moderate water during its active growth in cooler months, ensuring excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers as the plant fixes its own nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, making rich or high-nitrogen fertilizers unnecessary and potentially detrimental to flowering.
