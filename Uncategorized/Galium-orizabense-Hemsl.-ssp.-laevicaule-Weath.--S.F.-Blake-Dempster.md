## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico and Guatemala, primarily in mountainous regions |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Montane Forests and Open Slopes (e.g., pine-oak forests, rocky clearings) |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial to full sun. Thrives in bright light and can tolerate several hours of direct sunlight, especially in cooler montane conditions. |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent watering during the growing season, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce frequency during cooler or less active periods. |

## Introduction
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## Care Guide
This montane species thrives in bright, open conditions. Provide consistent moisture during warm months, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize sparingly in spring/summer to support healthy growth without over-enrichment.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during its active growth period in spring and summer. Avoid over-fertilizing.
