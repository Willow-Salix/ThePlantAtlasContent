## Introduction
Tilia is a genus of about 30 species of trees or bushes, native throughout most of the temperate Northern Hemisphere. The species are known as linden or lime for the European and Asian species, and linden or basswood for North American species and more generally in American literature. The greatest species diversity is found in Asia, but the genus also occurs widely in Europe and eastern North America. Under the Cronquist classification system, this genus was placed in the family Tiliaceae, but genetic research summarised by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has resulted in the incorporation of this genus, and of most of the previous family, into the Malvaceae.
Tilia is the only known ectomycorrhizal genus in the family Malvaceae. Studies of ectomycorrhizal relations of Tilia species indicate a wide range of fungal symbionts and a preference toward Ascomycota fungal partners.

## Care Guide
Carolina Basswood thrives in full sun to partial shade within a humid subtropical environment, preferring consistently moist yet well-drained soil. Regular watering and an annual spring fertilization will help ensure robust growth, mimicking its native deciduous forest conditions.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderately rich, organic soil. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can support healthy growth, especially in less fertile soils.
