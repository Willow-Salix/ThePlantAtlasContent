## Care Guide
This likely succulent, hailing from arid South American regions, thrives in full sun and requires infrequent watering due to its drought tolerance. Fertilization needs are minimal, with a diluted feed sufficient during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low; a diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
