## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States, specifically South Florida (Miami-Dade County) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Woodland (Pine Rockland ecosystem) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth). |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season (warm months), allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Drought tolerant once established, but prefers regular moisture during active growth. Reduce watering significantly in cooler, drier months. |

## Introduction
Polygala is a large genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygalaceae. They are commonly known as milkworts or snakeroots. The genus is distributed widely throughout much of the world in temperate zones and the tropics. The genus name Polygala comes from the ancient Greek "much milk", as the plant was thought to increase milk yields in cattle.

## Care Guide
Miami Milkwort thrives in conditions mimicking its native South Florida pine rocklands, requiring full to partial sun and well-drained soil. Provide moderate watering during warm growing periods, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and reduce watering in cooler months. Fertilize sparingly as it prefers lean nutrient conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Prefers lean, well-drained soils typical of pine rocklands. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, slow-release formula if growth is weak, primarily during the active growing season.
