## Care Guide
Laurentian Braya requires full sun and exceptionally well-drained, alkaline soil mimicking its native limestone alvars. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and avoid any waterlogging. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor conditions, so fertilizer should be applied sparingly or not at all.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Native habitats are typically nutrient-poor limestone soils, and excess fertilization can be detrimental.
