## Care Guide
This rare Ferris' Milkvetch thrives in full sun and well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, particularly avoiding excess moisture during its summer dormancy period. Avoid heavy fertilization to mimic its native serpentine habitat.

### Fertilizer
Adapted to nutrient-poor soils (like serpentine soils). Requires very minimal to no fertilization; excessive nutrients may be detrimental.
