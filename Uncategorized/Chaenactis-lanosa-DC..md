## Introduction
Chaenactis is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae which are known generally as pincushions and dustymaidens.
These wildflowers are native to western North America, especially the desert southwest of the United States. They are quite variable in appearance. They are generally aster-like in appearance with many disc florets in each head. There may be only disc florets, but sometimes there are also enlarged ray florets along the edges of the corolla. They may be white to yellow or pink.

## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring very little water once established. Avoid overwatering and provide minimal fertilization for best results, mimicking its arid natural habitat.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization needed. If desired, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once in spring.
