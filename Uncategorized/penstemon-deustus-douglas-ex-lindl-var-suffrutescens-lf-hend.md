## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Scabland Penstemon thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland. Provide full sun exposure and extremely well-draining soil, watering infrequently only when the soil is dry to the touch as it is highly drought-tolerant. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its preference for lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean, rocky soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, perhaps once in spring with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer, or none for established plants.
