## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas (e.g., Mexico, Brazil, Caribbean) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Dry Forest/Woodland/Disturbed Areas |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial shade; can tolerate bright indirect light. Native habitat suggests adaptability to open, well-lit conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Water regularly, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. It thrives with consistent moisture but requires good drainage to avoid root rot, mimicking tropical rainfall patterns. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wild poinsettia thrives in warm, bright conditions similar to its native tropical and subtropical American habitats. Provide ample sunlight, consistent moisture with good drainage, and regular fertilization during its growing period for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, reflecting the generally fertile but sometimes leached soils of its native habitat.
