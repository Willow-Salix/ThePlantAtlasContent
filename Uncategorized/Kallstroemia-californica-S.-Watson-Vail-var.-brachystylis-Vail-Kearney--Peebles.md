## Introduction
Kallstroemia is a genus of flowering plants in the caltrop family, Zygophyllaceae. The approximately 20 species it contains are native to tropical and warm temperate regions of the Americas. The flower and fruit morphology is similar to Tribulus. The convex fruits separate into about 10 nutlets each with one seed. The genus is named after A. Kallstroem who lived in the 18th century.

## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires very little water, being extremely drought tolerant once established. It prefers well-draining soil and does not need frequent fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for arid and semi-arid landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. This plant is adapted to poor to average soils and typically does not require frequent supplemental feeding. A light, balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season might be beneficial.
