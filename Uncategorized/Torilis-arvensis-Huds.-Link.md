## Care Guide
Spreading Hedgeparsley is a resilient annual plant that thrives in full sun to partial shade, adapting well to temperate and Mediterranean conditions. It requires moderate watering but tolerates periods of drought once established, and has low fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance choice for various soil types.

### Fertilizer
Low, as it is an opportunistic species capable of growing in average to poor soils and does not require rich nutrient inputs to thrive.
