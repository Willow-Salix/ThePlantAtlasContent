# Northrop's Epidendrum
### *Epicion northropiae (Schltr.) Small*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Bahamas |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Pine Woodland and Coppice |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun, tolerating some direct morning sun. Avoid harsh midday sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Water thoroughly when the potting medium approaches dryness, allowing for good drainage and air circulation around roots. Reduce frequency during cooler, dormant periods. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic or rupicolous orchid thrives in bright, indirect light, mimicking its natural habitat in the Bahamian pine woodlands. It requires consistent watering when the medium dries out, with good air circulation and distinct wet/dry cycles. Fertilize regularly with a weak solution during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Apply a balanced, diluted orchid-specific fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during active growth, typically in spring and summer. Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
