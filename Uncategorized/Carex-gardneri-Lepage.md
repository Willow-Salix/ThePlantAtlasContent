## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid sedge requires consistently wet to saturated soil and prefers full to partial sun, typical of its native temperate wetland habitat. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to nutrient-rich organic soils rather than heavily amended ones. Ensure constant moisture for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in organic-rich wetland soils but does not typically require heavy or frequent fertilization.
