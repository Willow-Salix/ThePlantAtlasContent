## Introduction
Abutilon  is a large genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia. General common names include Indian mallow and velvetleaf; ornamental varieties may be known as room maple, parlor maple, or flowering maple.
The genus name is an 18th-century Neo-Latin word that came from the Arabic ’abū-ṭīlūn (أبو طيلون),  the name given by Avicenna to this or a similar genus.
The type species is Abutilon theophrasti. Several species formerly placed in Abutilon, including the cultivated species and hybrids commonly known as "flowering maples", have recently (2012, 2014) been transferred to the new genus Callianthe.

## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, preferring its soil to dry completely between waterings. Mimicking its native arid conditions, it needs infrequent, deep watering and very light, if any, fertilization for optimal health and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer needed. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, or none if planted in rich soil.
