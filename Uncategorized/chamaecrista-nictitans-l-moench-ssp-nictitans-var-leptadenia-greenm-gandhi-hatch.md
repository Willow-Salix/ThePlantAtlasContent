## 🌱 Overview
Chamaecrista is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Members of the genus are commonly known as sensitive pea. Several species are capable of rapid plant movement. Unlike the related genera Cassia and Senna, members of Chamaecrista form root nodules.
Chamaecrista has 367 species, with a wide distribution – the Americas from Minnesota to northern Argentina, sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Iran, the Indian Subcontinent, Indochina, China, Korea, Japan, Malesia, New Guinea, and Australia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Sensitive Partridge Pea, provide full sun exposure and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions. Its nitrogen-fixing ability means it requires minimal fertilization. Emulate its native subtropical grassland environment for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Supplemental feeding with a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer may be beneficial in very poor soils, but is often not required.
