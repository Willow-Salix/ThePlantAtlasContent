## 🌱 Overview
Medicago lupulina, commonly known as black medick, nonesuch, or hop clover, is a plant of dry grassland belonging to the legume or clover family. Plants of the genus Medicago, or bur clovers, are closely related to the true clovers (Trifolium) and sweet clover (Melilotus). Like the true clovers, black medick has three leaflets and a small, yellow flower closely resembling those of lesser trefoil. Black medick belongs to the same genus as alfalfa.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This variety of Black Medick requires full sun exposure and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between applications. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it has very low fertilizer needs and can tolerate less fertile soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil and does not require additional nitrogen fertilizer. It can thrive in poor to moderately fertile soils.
