## Introduction
Polygala is a large genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygalaceae. They are commonly known as milkworts or snakeroots. The genus is distributed widely throughout much of the world in temperate zones and the tropics. The genus name Polygala comes from the ancient Greek "much milk", as the plant was thought to increase milk yields in cattle.

## Care Guide
Shining Milkwort is a desert-adapted plant that thrives in full sun and requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing its soil to dry out completely. It prefers lean, well-draining soils with minimal fertilization, reflecting its origins in arid scrubland environments.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs, thriving in lean to poor soils; a very light, balanced fertilizer application once a year in spring is sufficient, or none at all if planted in native soil.
