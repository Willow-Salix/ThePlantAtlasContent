## Care Guide
Austrian Draba is a resilient alpine plant requiring full sun and very well-drained, lean soil to mimic its native exposed, high-altitude habitat. Water sparingly, only when the soil is dry, and avoid rich fertilizers to ensure its longevity and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; thrives in lean, well-drained, rocky or gravelly soil, indicating it adapted to nutrient-poor environments.
