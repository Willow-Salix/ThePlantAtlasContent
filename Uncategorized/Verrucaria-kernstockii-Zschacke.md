## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Europe, specifically Central and Northern Europe (e.g., Austria, Germany, Scandinavia, UK, France, Italy) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate, often found on calcareous rocks in humid or semi-exposed environments, such as stream beds or moist forest areas. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade, tolerating some direct morning sun, but protection from harsh afternoon sun is crucial to prevent desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High atmospheric humidity is paramount. Frequent misting or exposure to consistent moisture (e.g., from rain or proximity to water bodies) is needed, allowing for periodic drying. |

## 🌱 Overview
Verrucaria is a genus of lichenized (lichen-forming) fungi in the family Verrucariaceae. These lichens form crust-like growths on rocks, particularly limestone and other calcareous surfaces, though some species also grow on siliceous rock or occasionally on bark and soil. The genus includes both terrestrial species found in dry environments and marine species that can survive periodic flooding or permanent submersion in coastal and freshwater habitats. With about 150 accepted species worldwide, Verrucaria represents a challenging taxonomic group due to overlapping physical characteristics and the polyphyletic nature of the genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in stable, humid environments on calcareous rock. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and ensure high atmospheric humidity through frequent misting or proximity to water. Avoid any form of fertilization as it is detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens are highly adapted to nutrient-poor environments; added fertilizers can be detrimental.
