## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central Florida, USA |
| **Climate** | Xeric Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open scrub and pinelands. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry completely between waterings. Requires excellent drainage and is highly drought-tolerant, typical of sandy scrubland species. |

## Introduction
Lesquerella is the former name of a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Recent work has shown that Lesquerella is indistinct from the genus Physaria and both genera have been united under Physaria. In addition, the former Lesquerella of the southeastern United States have been moved to the genus Paysonia since 2002. The genus Lesquerella is now no longer applied to any species and is considered defunct.
The genus is named in honor of Leo Lesquereux, 1805–1889, Swiss and American botanist.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires exceptionally well-draining soil, characteristic of its native xeric scrubland habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely, and avoid over-fertilizing as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Native to nutrient-poor sandy soils, so excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
