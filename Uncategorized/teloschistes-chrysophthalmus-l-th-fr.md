## 🌱 Overview
Teloschistes is a genus of lichens in the family Teloschistaceae, of which it is the namesake. It was circumscribed by Norwegian botanist Johannes Musaeus Norman in 1852. The name of the genus means "split ends". The genus was originally described as Borrera by Swedish lichenologist Erik Archarius, after English botanist William Borrer, but this name was rejected.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic/saxicolous lichen thrives in bright, open conditions characteristic of coastal Mediterranean and temperate zones. Provide ample light and high atmospheric humidity, ensuring periods of drying between hydration cycles, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilization; obtains all necessary nutrients from airborne particles and dissolved minerals in precipitation.
