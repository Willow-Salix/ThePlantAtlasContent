## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Humid temperate regions, including the Pacific Northwest of North America, Eastern North America (Appalachian Mountains), and Western Europe. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Humid Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light; sensitive to direct sun and excessive heat which can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and frequent wetting (e.g., daily misting or rainfall simulation); it absorbs moisture directly and does not tolerate prolonged dryness. |

## Introduction
Collema (jelly lichen) is a genus of lichens in the family Collemataceae. The photobiont is the cyanobacterium genus Nostoc. Species in this genus typically grow on nutrient-rich bark or somewhat siliceous or calcareous rocks in humid environments.

## Care Guide
To care for Collema subflaccidum, provide consistently high humidity and low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its natural temperate forest understory habitat. Avoid direct sun and never use traditional fertilizers, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the environment.

### Fertilizer
None; traditional fertilizers are harmful. Lichens absorb all necessary nutrients from airborne particles and dissolved minerals in water.
