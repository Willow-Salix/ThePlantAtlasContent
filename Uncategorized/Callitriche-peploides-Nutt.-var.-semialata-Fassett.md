## Care Guide
This aquatic plant thrives when fully or partially submerged in fresh water within a pond or aquatic container. It prefers bright light, ranging from full sun to partial shade, and consistent water levels are crucial for its health. Minimal fertilization is typically sufficient, especially in natural pond settings.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from nutrient-rich water or occasional use of a balanced aquatic plant fertilizer in a contained environment.
