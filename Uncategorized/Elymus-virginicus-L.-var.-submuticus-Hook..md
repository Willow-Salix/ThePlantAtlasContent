## Care Guide
This adaptable temperate grass thrives in partial shade to full sun, preferring consistently moist, well-drained soil. It has low to moderate fertilizer needs, requiring only occasional feeding to support healthy growth in its native North American climate.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a native grass adapted to average soil conditions, it does not require heavy fertilization but can benefit from a light, balanced fertilizer application in spring if soil fertility is poor.
