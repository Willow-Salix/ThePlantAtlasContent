## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Carpathian Mountains, Central Europe, and Scandinavia (montane and subalpine regions) |
| **Climate** | Montane/Subalpine Temperate |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in bright, indirect light to full sun exposure, typical of exposed rock faces in mountain environments, but also tolerates periods of cloud cover and fog. |
| **Watering** | Relies solely on atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, fog, snowmelt) for hydration. Requires frequent ambient moisture and high humidity; it cannot be watered like a vascular plant. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
This saxicolous lichen thrives in cool, clean air with bright light and consistent atmospheric moisture, mimicking its mountain habitat. It requires no soil, artificial watering, or external fertilization, deriving all its sustenance from the environment.

### Fertilizer
Requires no artificial fertilizer. It obtains necessary nutrients from clean air and precipitation and is highly sensitive to pollution and chemical additives.
