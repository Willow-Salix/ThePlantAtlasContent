## Care Guide
This woodland perennial thrives in dappled to full shade, requiring consistently moist, well-drained, and organically rich soil to mimic its native forest floor environment. Ensure good drainage and provide a light feeding of compost or organic fertilizer in early spring for optimal growth and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, organically amended soil. An annual top-dressing of compost or a light application of a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer in early spring is sufficient.
