# Radula Complanata

*Radula complanata (L.) Dumort.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (humid, shaded understory or sheltered niches) |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light. This plant thrives in deep shade and will be damaged by direct sunlight. Indirect, filtered light is essential. |
| **Watering** | High and consistent humidity is critical. Requires frequent misting or a consistently moist (but not waterlogged) substrate, mimicking its natural environment on damp tree bark or rocks. |

## Introduction
The radula (US: ; pl.: radulae or radulas)  is an anatomical structure found in most mollusks, serving as their primary feeding tool. Often compared to a tongue, this minutely toothed, chitinous ribbon typically functions by scraping or cutting food before it enters the esophagus. Mollusks in every class possess a radula, except for bivalves, which instead employ waving cilia to draw in minute organisms for feeding.
Within the gastropods, the radula is used in feeding by both herbivorous and carnivorous snails and slugs. The arrangement of teeth (denticles) on the radular ribbon varies considerably from one group to another.
In most of the more ancient lineages of gastropods, the radula is used to graze, by scraping diatoms and other microscopic algae off rock surfaces and other substrates.
Predatory marine snails such as the Naticidae use the radula plus an acidic secretion to bore through the shell of other mollusks. Other predatory marine snails, such as the Conidae, use a specialized radular tooth as a poisoned harpoon. Predatory pulmonate land slugs, such as the ghost slug, use elongated razor-sharp teeth on the radula to seize and devour earthworms. Predatory cephalopods, such as squid, use the radula for cutting prey.
The introduction of the term "radula" (Latin, "little scraper") is usually attributed to the Russian zoologist Alexander von Middendorff in 1847.

## Care Guide
Radula complanata requires a highly humid environment with consistent moisture and very low, indirect light, mimicking its native temperate forest habitat. Avoid direct sun and ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues while maintaining high humidity.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to none. Epiphytic liverworts obtain nutrients from rainwater and atmospheric dust; excessive fertilization can be detrimental. If used, apply a very diluted liquid fertilizer extremely sparingly.
