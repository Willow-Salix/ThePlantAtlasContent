# Isopterygium micans

*Isopterygium micans (Sw.) Kindb.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Gulf Coast states), Mexico, Central America, Caribbean, and parts of tropical South America. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade; avoid direct sunlight. Thrives in deeply shaded, humid environments, often on forest floors or tree bases. |
| **Watering** | Constant high humidity and consistently moist substrate are essential. Never allow to dry out completely. Frequent misting or placement in a closed terrarium is ideal to maintain high ambient humidity. |

## Introduction
Isopterygium is a genus of mosses variably placed in the families Hypnaceae and Pylaisiadelphaceae.  It includes 137 species and has a cosmopolitan distribution.
The first type species was I. planissimum, which was superseded by the lectotype I. tenerum in 1979.

## Care Guide
This tropical moss thrives in a consistently humid environment with very low to partial light, mimicking its native forest floor habitat. Ensure the substrate remains moist but not waterlogged, and provide high ambient humidity through regular misting or a terrarium. Minimal fertilization is required.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs. If fertilized, use a very dilute solution (e.g., 1/4 strength or less) infrequently, perhaps once a month during active growth.
