## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Alpine regions globally, including North America, Europe (e.g., Alps, Scandinavia), and Asia (e.g., Siberia, Himalayas). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, Boreal/Cold Temperate Rocky Environments. |
| **Sunlight** | High light to full sun, typical of exposed rock surfaces above treeline or in open northern environments. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent but thorough hydration via misting or soaking, followed by complete drying periods to prevent rot. Mimics natural rain, snowmelt, and fog events. |

## Introduction
Rock tripe is the common name for various lichens of the genus Umbilicaria that grow on rocks. They are widely distributed, including on bare rock in Antarctica, and throughout northern parts of North America such as New England and the Rocky Mountains. They are edible when properly prepared; soaking extensively and boiling with changes of water removes the bitterness and purgative properties. They have been used as a famine food in extreme cases when other food sources were unavailable, as by early American northern explorers.
Umbilicaria esculenta is commonly used as a food in Asian cuisine and a restorative medicine in traditional Chinese medicine.

## Care Guide
Navel Lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions, mirroring its native alpine and arctic rocky habitats. It requires infrequent but thorough hydration, followed by complete drying periods, absorbing moisture directly from the air. No external fertilization is necessary, as excess nutrients can be harmful to these symbiotic organisms.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and their substrate. Excess nutrients can be detrimental.
