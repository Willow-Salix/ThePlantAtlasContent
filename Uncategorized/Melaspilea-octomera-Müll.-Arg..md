## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of South America (e.g., Brazil), Central America, and Asia |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium, indirect light; thrives in dappled or filtered sun similar to an understory environment |
| **Watering** | High humidity is crucial. Requires frequent misting or a consistently high-humidity environment; never allow to dry out completely but avoid standing water. |

## Introduction
Melaspilea is a genus of fungi in the family Melaspileaceae. The genus includes both lichen-forming species that grow on tree bark and lichenicolous species that parasitise other lichens. Originally, Melaspilea encompassed a broad and diverse group of species, but a 2015 molecular study narrowed its circumscription, showing that many species historically placed in the genus actually belonged to unrelated lineages. In its current sense, Melaspilea belongs to the family Melaspileaceae and order Eremithallales within Dothideomycetes and is characterised by dark fruiting bodies with single-septum spores. The genus has a worldwide distribution but is particularly diverse in tropical regions, with species primarily found growing on the bark of trees and woody plants.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest habitat. Provide consistently high humidity and low to medium, indirect light, avoiding any direct sun. Avoid chemical fertilizers, as it absorbs nutrients from the air and its substrate.

### Fertilizer
None to minimal. As a lichen, it primarily acquires nutrients from the air and its substrate, and is highly sensitive to chemical fertilizers.
