## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Cascade Range, Olympic Mountains, and Northern Rocky Mountains (including British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and California). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun, requiring high light exposure typical of exposed alpine environments. |
| **Watering** | High watering needs; keep soil consistently moist, especially during the growing season, mimicking its native habitat near snowmelt or streams. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
The Cascade Willow thrives in conditions mimicking its alpine home: full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is adapted to cold winters and prefers lean nutrient conditions, requiring minimal fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. It is adapted to lean, rocky alpine soils. A light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring may be beneficial, but avoid over-fertilization.
