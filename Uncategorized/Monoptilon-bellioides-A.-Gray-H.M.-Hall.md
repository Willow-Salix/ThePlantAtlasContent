## Care Guide
This resilient annual thrives in the harsh conditions of its native desert, requiring full sun and very little water. Plant in well-draining, poor soil and water sparingly, ensuring the soil dries out completely between applications. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization to mimic its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Very low; thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils. Little to no supplemental fertilization is typically needed.
