## Care Guide
Culver's Root flourishes in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained, organically rich soil. Regular watering is crucial, particularly during dry spells, and an annual application of compost will provide sufficient nutrients without the need for heavy chemical fertilizers. This mimics its native temperate woodland and prairie conditions.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; prefers organically rich soil. Amend with compost or other organic matter annually; heavy fertilization is generally not needed.
