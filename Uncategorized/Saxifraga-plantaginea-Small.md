## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, moist, and shady conditions, mimicking its native temperate mountain habitat. Ensure consistently moist, well-draining soil and provide only light fertilization during its active growth period. Protect from intense direct sun to prevent scorching.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient. A diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied once a month during the active growing season.
