## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Peru (Andes Mountains) |
| **Climate** | High Andean Montane Grasslands / Puna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring 6+ hours of direct sunlight daily due to its high-altitude native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the topsoil to dry out between waterings. It thrives in well-drained conditions, tolerating some drought once established. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Thrive by providing full sun exposure, mimicking its native high-altitude environment. Water moderately, ensuring well-draining soil and allowing it to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize sparingly with a low-nitrogen formula to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced or low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus/potassium fertilizer can be applied sparingly if soil is poor.
