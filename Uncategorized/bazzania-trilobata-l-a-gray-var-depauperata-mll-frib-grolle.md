## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort requires consistently moist conditions and very high humidity, similar to its native forest understory habitat. Provide low, indirect light and avoid direct sun exposure. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Bryophytes obtain sufficient nutrients from decaying organic matter and atmospheric deposition; excess fertilizer can be detrimental.
