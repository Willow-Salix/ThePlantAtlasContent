## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in its native arid scrubland, Texas Croton prefers full sun and well-draining soil. It is very drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering once established. Fertilization needs are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to less nutrient-rich environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Typically does not require heavy fertilization, especially in native or well-amended soils. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring may benefit container plants or those in very poor soil.
