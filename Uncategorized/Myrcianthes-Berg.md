## Care Guide
Myrcianthes species generally thrive in conditions that mimic their native subtropical to tropical forest habitats, preferring partial to full sun exposure and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Regular, moderate fertilization during the growing season supports healthy growth, ensuring the plant receives adequate nutrients from its simulated environment.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, balanced fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease feeding during cooler, dormant periods.
