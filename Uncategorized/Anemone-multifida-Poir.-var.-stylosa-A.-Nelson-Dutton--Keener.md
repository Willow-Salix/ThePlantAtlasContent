## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native subalpine meadows. Provide full to partial sun and consistently moist, very well-drained soil. Light fertilization with organic matter will support healthy growth, ensuring good drainage is crucial to prevent rot.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Amend soil with compost or other organic matter rather than heavy chemical fertilizers.
