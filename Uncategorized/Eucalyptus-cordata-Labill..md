## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tasmania, Australia |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires bright, direct light for optimal growth, reflecting its exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; allow the topsoil to dry out between waterings. Requires excellent drainage and is intolerant of waterlogging, consistent with its growth in well-drained, often rocky, soils. |

## Introduction
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## Care Guide
The Silver-dollar Eucalyptus thrives in full, direct sunlight and necessitates well-draining soil, allowing it to dry slightly between waterings to mimic its cool temperate, subalpine native environment. It is a low-maintenance plant regarding nutrient intake, performing best with minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; rarely requires fertilization as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy loams. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be used sparingly if growth appears stunted.
