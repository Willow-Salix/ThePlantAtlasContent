## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in partial to full shade, preferring to be protected from intense sun. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, and tolerates lean, well-draining soils with minimal fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, diluted fertilizer, perhaps once or twice during the growing season. It thrives in lean, well-draining mineral-rich soils.
