## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant is perfectly adapted to cold, high-latitude environments, requiring full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It naturally thrives in nutrient-poor conditions, meaning fertilizer should be kept to a minimum or avoided entirely.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Minimal to no fertilization is required.
