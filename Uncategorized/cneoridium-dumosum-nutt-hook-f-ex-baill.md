## 🌱 Overview
Cneoridium is a monotypic genus in the citrus family which contains the single species Cneoridium dumosum, commonly known as bushrue or coast spice bush. As a perennial, evergreen shrub, Cneoridium is native to the coast of southern California and Baja California, thriving in hot, dry conditions. This plant is characterized by a distinctive citrusy aroma and small, white flowers that appear from winter to spring. The flowers eventually become round berries that resemble a miniature version of the common citrus.
Widely known and utilized by the indigenous peoples of the Americas for centuries, this species was first discovered and introduced to Western science by Thomas Nuttall, on his trip to San Diego. Today, this species is listed as imperiled, as some of its habitats are threatened by coastal development, urbanization, military operations and fire suppression. It has also found its way into horticultural circles in its native regions, providing gardeners with a low-maintenance shrub that gives off rewarding flowers. Despite attractive qualities like its distinctive fragrance and flowers, this species may cause blistering and burning rashes to people after contact with its foliage, a phenomenon common with members of the citrus family, known as phytophotodermatitis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bush Rue thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean chaparral, requiring full sun and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering, and has minimal fertilizer requirements. Mimicking these arid, sun-drenched conditions is key to its success.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in nutrient-poor, well-draining soils. A very light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring, or none at all, is sufficient.
