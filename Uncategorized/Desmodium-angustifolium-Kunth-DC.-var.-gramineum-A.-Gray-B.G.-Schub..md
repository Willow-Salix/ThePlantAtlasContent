## Introduction
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. Species are distributed widely – from Quebec to northern Argentina in the Americas, across northern and southern tropical Africa, in the southern Arabian Peninsula, in Myanmar and Thailand, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade in well-drained soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and provide light fertilization during the growing season. It is a robust plant, tolerant of some drought once established, making it relatively low-maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the growing season, especially if soil is poor. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and may not require heavy nitrogen application.
