## Introduction
Xanthoparmelia (commonly known as green rock shields or rock-shield lichens) is a genus of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. This genus of lichen is commonly found in the United States, South America, southern Africa, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
The name means 'golden yellow parmelia'. The photobiont (photosynthetic partner) is Trebouxia (a genus of green algae).

## Care Guide
Ahti's Neofuscelia Lichen thrives in cold, exposed environments typical of Alpine Tundra, requiring full sun on acidic rock surfaces. It sustains itself on natural atmospheric moisture and tolerates periods of drought, making artificial watering unnecessary. This lichen is extremely sensitive to nutrient enrichment, so all forms of fertilizer should be strictly avoided.

### Fertilizer
None; lichens are highly sensitive to pollutants and excess nutrients, which can be detrimental.
