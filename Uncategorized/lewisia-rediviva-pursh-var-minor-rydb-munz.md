## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Intermountain West and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States (e.g., Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado) and Canada (e.g., British Columbia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-arid Montane to Alpine Foothills, characterized by hot, dry summers and cold, often snowy winters, with significant periods of drought. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily). This plant thrives in open, exposed areas with intense light. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely low; highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply only during its active growth period in spring, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires excellent drainage and very little to no water during its summer dormancy to prevent rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bitterroot (Lewisia rediviva) is a small perennial herb in the family Montiaceae. Its specific epithet rediviva ("revived, reborn") refers to its ability to regenerate from dry and seemingly dead roots.
The genus Lewisia was moved in 2009 from the purslane family (Portulacaceae) with adoption of the APG III system, to the family Montiaceae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bitterroot thrives in full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its arid montane origins. Provide minimal water during its spring growth and almost none during summer dormancy to prevent rot, as it prefers lean, nutrient-poor soils. Avoid overwatering and rich fertilization for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; prefers lean, nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils. Avoid rich fertilizers, as excessive nutrients can lead to lush, weak growth and increased susceptibility to rot.
