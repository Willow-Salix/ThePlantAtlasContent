## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Caribbean islands (Greater and Lesser Antilles) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light; mimicking its understory habitat, it should be protected from direct sun which can scorch its fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Its native environment has high rainfall and humidity, so allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, but never completely dry out. High humidity is also essential. |

## 🌱 Overview
Thelypteris (maiden ferns) is a genus of ferns in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, family Thelypteridaceae, order Polypodiales. Two radically different circumscriptions of the genus are in use as of January 2020. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the genus is a very small one with about two species. In other approaches, the genus is the only one in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, and so includes between 875 and 1083 species.
The genus name is from Greek thēlys "female" and pteris "fern". However, "female fern" usually refers to the common lady-fern.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Arrowhead Maiden Fern thrives in conditions replicating its native tropical rainforest understory: consistent moisture, very high humidity, and low to medium indirect light. Ensure its soil remains moist but not saturated, and protect it from direct sunlight and dry air to prevent frond damage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding during the active growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., half-strength every 4-6 weeks). Reduce or stop fertilization in fall and winter.
