## Care Guide
This adaptable grass, native to the humid subtropical southeastern US, thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering to maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Its resilience makes it a relatively low-maintenance plant in appropriate growing conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally thrives in average soils without heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is sufficient if soil nutrients are low.
