## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in temperate to boreal regions of North America, Europe, and Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Open Rocky Outcrops |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; requires high light exposure characteristic of open rock surfaces, often found in exposed conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Absorbs moisture directly from the atmosphere (rain, dew, mist). Requires occasional wetting followed by dry periods; highly desiccation tolerant. Avoid constant wetness or standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Acarospora is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Acarosporaceae. Most species in the genus are crustose lichens that grow on rocks in open and arid places all over the world. They may look like a cobblestone road or cracked up old paint, and are commonly called cobblestone lichens or cracked lichens. They usually grow on rock (are "saxicolous"), but some grow on soil (terricolous) or on other lichens. Some species in the genus are fungi that live as parasites on other lichens (lichenicolous fungi). Acarospora is a widely distributed genus, with about 128 species according to a 2008 estimate.
Species in Acarospora may be shiny as if covered with a glossy varnish, or dull and powdery looking. They have a diverse range of colors, from the brilliant yellow bright cobblestone lichen, to the dark reddish-brown mountain cobblestone lichen, or they can appear tan, gray, or white, from a dusty-looking coating (pruina). They may grow in crustose forms like a warty surface (verrucose), like cracking-up old crust of paint (rimose), like a bunch of "islands" in a dry lake bed (areolate), like the flakes of cracking up paint are peeling up at the edges (sub-squamulous), or like the flakes are growing over others like scales (squamulous).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide high light conditions and excellent air circulation, mimicking its exposed rocky habitat. Ensure occasional access to atmospheric moisture (e.g., misting or high humidity) allowing for complete drying between wetting cycles. Absolutely no traditional fertilization is required or recommended.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None; lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air and their rocky substrate. Artificial fertilization is unnecessary and can be harmful.
