## Introduction
Bromus is a large genus of grasses, classified in its own tribe Bromeae. They are commonly known as bromes, brome grasses, cheat grasses, or chess grasses. Estimates in the scientific literature of the number of species have ranged from 100 to 400, but plant taxonomists currently recognize around 160–170 species.
Bromus is part of the cool-season grass lineage (subfamily Pooideae), which includes about 3300 species.  Within Pooideae, Bromus is classified in tribe Bromeae (it is the only genus in the tribe).  Bromus is closely related to the wheat-grass lineage (tribe Triticeae) that includes such economically important genera as Triticum (wheat), Hordeum (barley) and Secale (rye).

## Care Guide
Nodding Brome, a grass native to temperate North American forests and grasslands, thrives in conditions ranging from partial sun to full sun. It prefers moderate, consistent moisture but can tolerate short dry spells. Minimal fertilization is generally required for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is usually sufficient, especially in poorer soils.
