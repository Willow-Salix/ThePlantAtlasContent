## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States, primarily Texas and other Gulf Coast states. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Savanna and Humid Subtropical, often with dry periods. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily). Thrives in open, unshaded environments typical of prairies and savannas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist soil during active growth, but is notably drought-tolerant once established. Requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## Care Guide
This Liatris variety thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native prairie habitat. Water consistently during active growth and dry periods, ensuring good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Fertilize sparingly to encourage robust, compact growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Thrives in average to poor soils; over-fertilization can lead to weak, leggy growth. A light application of balanced granular fertilizer or compost in early spring is usually sufficient.
