## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America, specifically the Pacific Northwest region (e.g., British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Northern California) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland/Forest, characterized by mild, wet winters and drier, but often humid, summers |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect to partial shade, typically found on tree bark under a forest canopy |
| **Watering** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and frequent wetting from rain or mist, absorbing moisture directly from the environment rather than through roots in soil |

## Introduction
Julella is a genus of ascomycete fungi. Most species are non-lichenised, bark-dwelling saprophytes, though some collections appear to be facultatively lichenised with the green alga Trentepohlia. The fungi produce immersed, black, flask-shaped perithecia with a dark involucrellum. Their asci are double-walled and contain two or eight large, colourless, muriform (multi-chambered) ascospores. Asexual fruiting bodies (pycnidia) produce simple, rod-shaped conidia. No secondary metabolites are known. The genus was introduced by Jean-Henri Fabre in 1879. Modern treatments recognise only a few species, and its family placement is unsettled, with recent sources placing it in Thelenellaceae, Trypetheliaceae, or Didymosphaeriaceae.

## Care Guide
This corticolous lichen thrives in environments with high ambient humidity and indirect light, mimicking its native temperate woodland habitat. It does not require traditional soil watering or fertilization, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients directly from the air and precipitation while growing on suitable bark substrates.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilization; obtains necessary trace nutrients directly from atmospheric deposition and occasional surface runoff on its host tree bark
