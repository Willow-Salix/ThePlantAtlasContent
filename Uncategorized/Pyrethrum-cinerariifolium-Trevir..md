## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Dalmatia (Croatia), Balkan Peninsula |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Water regularly during the active growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring significantly less water in winter. |

## Introduction
Tanacetum cinerariifolium is a species of flowering plant in the aster family, Asteraceae, and formerly part of the genus Pyrethrum, but now placed in the genus Chrysanthemum, or the genus Tanacetum by some biologists. It is called the Dalmatian chrysanthemum or Dalmatian pyrethrum, denoting its origin in western coastal Balkan Peninsula, where it ranges from Dalmatia to Albania. It looks more like the common daisy than other pyrethrums do. Its flowers, typically white with yellow centers, grow from numerous fairly rigid stems. Plants have blue-green leaves and grow to 45 to 100 cm (18 to 39 in) in height.

## Care Guide
Dalmatian Pyrethrum thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean environment. It requires regular watering during its growing period but is very drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization needs are minimal, preferring leaner conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is usually sufficient, or none if planted in reasonably fertile soil.
