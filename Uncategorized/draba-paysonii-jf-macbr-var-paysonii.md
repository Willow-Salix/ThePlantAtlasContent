## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States, particularly the Rocky Mountains (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Nevada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Rocky Slopes |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily); it naturally grows in exposed, high-altitude environments without tree cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate during the growing season; prefers well-draining, gravelly soil and tolerates periods of dryness. Allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot, mimicking snowmelt and occasional rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Draba is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, commonly known as whitlow-grasses (though they are not related to the true grasses).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Payson's Draba thrives in conditions mimicking its native alpine habitat, requiring full sun and very well-draining, lean soil. Water moderately during the growing season, allowing for slight drying between waterings, and fertilize sparingly, if at all. This cold-tolerant plant is well-suited for rock gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; it thrives in lean, rocky, nutrient-poor soils. A very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once annually in early spring if desired, but often not necessary.
