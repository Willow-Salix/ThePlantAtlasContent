## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and Central United States, extending from the Great Lakes region south to Georgia and west to Oklahoma. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest biome margins and prairies (dry-mesic woodlands, clearings, and open rocky sites). |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial sun to full sun; tolerates full sun in cooler climates but appreciates some afternoon shade in hot, southern regions to prevent leaf scorch. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate; allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. It is tolerant of some drought once established, reflecting its native dry-mesic conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Blephilia, the pagoda plant or wood mint, is a genus of four species of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. They are all herbaceous plants native to eastern North America. Blephilia are most often found in open areas, glades, and mesic forests.  All species of Blephilia are considered threatened or endangered in some states.

The genus includes only perennial species that spread by both seeds and through stem division. Small white to purple-lavender flowers occur in inflorescences that cluster in the upper leaf axils, often in several circular layers (hence the common name pagoda-plant).  Leaves are generally lanceolate to ovate and vary in shades of green.  Leaves are either petiolate or subsessile (depending on the species).  Like many other members of the subtribe Menthinae, all parts of Blephilia are highly aromatic when crushed and have smells similar to menthol and spearmint.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Downy Pagoda-Plant is an adaptable species thriving in well-draining soil under partial to full sun, especially with some afternoon shade in hotter climates. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and is quite drought-tolerant once established, needing minimal fertilizer to flourish.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typically thrives in average garden soils without heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in very poor soils.
