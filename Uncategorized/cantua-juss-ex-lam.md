## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cantua, native to the Andean mountains, requires bright light and well-draining soil to mimic its high-altitude environment. Water regularly, allowing the soil to dry slightly, and fertilize moderately during the growing season. Protect from extreme heat or prolonged drought.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. Use a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
