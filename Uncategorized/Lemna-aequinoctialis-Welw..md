## Introduction
Lemna is a genus of free-floating aquatic plants referred to by the common name "duckweed". They are morphologically divergent members of the arum family Araceae. These rapidly growing plants have found uses as a model system for studies in community ecology, basic plant biology, ecotoxicology, and production of biopharmaceuticals, and as a source of animal feeds for agriculture and aquaculture. Currently, 14 species of Lemna are recognised.

## Care Guide
Lesser duckweed is a fast-growing aquatic plant that requires consistent warm freshwater. Provide ample bright light and ensure the water contains sufficient nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, to support its rapid growth and spread.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in nutrient-rich water; benefits from regular replenishment of macro and micronutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus.
