## Introduction
Sclerocactus ("hard cactus", from Greek; refers to the hard, dry fruit) is a genus of cacti.  It comprises about 15 species, the exact number depending on the authority. These species are xerophytic. They are sometimes called 'fishhook cactus' or 'little barrels.'

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in full, direct sun and requires infrequent, deep watering, with the soil completely drying out between sessions. Fertilization should be very minimal, mirroring the lean nutrients of its arid native habitat. Providing excellent drainage is crucial for its survival.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; use a highly diluted, low-nitrogen cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer) or not at all if regularly repotted.
