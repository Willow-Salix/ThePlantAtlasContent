## Care Guide
The Russian Olive is a hardy plant that flourishes in full sun and is highly tolerant of drought once established, requiring infrequent deep watering. It has minimal fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it adaptable to poor soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a nitrogen-fixer, it can thrive in poor, lean soils. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, typically only in extremely nutrient-deficient conditions.
