# Thamnogala

*Thamnogala D. Hawksw.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Variable; species within the genus are found globally in diverse ecosystems where their host lichens thrive, reported from temperate to tropical regions. |
| **Climate** | Diverse, ranging from temperate to tropical and alpine, reflecting the varied habitats of its host lichens which can be found in a multitude of biomes. |
| **Sunlight** | Not applicable; Thamnogala is a lichenicolous fungus and does not perform photosynthesis. Its 'light exposure' is indirectly determined by its host lichen's position in its habitat. |
| **Watering** | Not applicable in the traditional plant sense; as a fungus, it requires consistent ambient humidity and moisture, typically obtained via its host lichen and the surrounding microenvironment. |

## Care Guide
Thamnogala D. Hawksw. is a genus of lichenicolous fungi, not a plant, meaning conventional plant care is irrelevant. Its survival is entirely dependent on the presence and health of its specific lichen host, from which it parasitically obtains all nutrients and moisture. Therefore, 'caring' for Thamnogala means ensuring a suitable environment for its host lichen, typically involving consistent humidity and appropriate light for the host.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; as a parasitic lichenicolous fungus, Thamnogala derives all necessary nutrients directly from its host lichen, rather than from soil or external fertilizers.
