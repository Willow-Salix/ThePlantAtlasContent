## Introduction
Geranium is a genus of 422 species of annual, biennial, and perennial plants that are commonly known as geraniums or cranesbills. They are found throughout the temperate regions of the world and the mountains of the tropics, with the greatest diversity in the eastern part of the Mediterranean region.
The palmately cleft leaves are broadly circular in form. The flowers have five petals and are coloured white, pink, purple, or blue, often with distinctive veining. Geraniums will grow in any soil as long as it is not waterlogged. Propagation is by semiripe cuttings in summer, by seed, or by division in autumn or spring.
Geraniums are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, ghost moth, and mouse moth. At least several species of Geranium are gynodioecious. The species Geranium viscosissimum (sticky geranium) is considered to be protocarnivorous.

## Care Guide
This geranium thrives in conditions mimicking its native montane habitat, preferring partial to full sun with protection from intense afternoon heat. Maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, and provide moderate fertilization during its active growth period for best results.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season.
