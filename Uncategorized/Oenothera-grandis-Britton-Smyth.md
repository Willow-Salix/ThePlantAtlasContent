## Care Guide
Showy Evening Primrose thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native temperate grassland habitat. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and requires minimal fertilization to encourage robust growth and abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is optional.
