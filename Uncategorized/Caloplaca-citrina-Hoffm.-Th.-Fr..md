## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Cosmopolitan, found across temperate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, particularly common in Europe and North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate, thriving in open, exposed habitats within oceanic to continental climates. |
| **Sunlight** | High; thrives in full sun to partial sun, often found on exposed rocks, walls, and bark in well-lit areas. |
| **Watering** | Requires periods of moisture (from rain, dew, or misting) followed by complete drying. Does not require soil watering, but benefits from high ambient humidity or occasional misting to simulate natural rainfall. |

## Introduction
Caloplaca is a lichen genus comprising a number of distinct species. Members of the genus are commonly called firedot lichen, jewel lichen. gold lichens, "orange lichens", but they are not always orange, as in the case of C. albovariegata. The distribution of this lichen genus is worldwide, extending from Antarctica to the high Arctic. It includes a portion of northern North America and the Russian High Arctic. There are about thirty species of Caloplaca in the flora of the British Isles.
A new species of Caloplaca, C. obamae, the first species to be named in honor of Barack Obama, was discovered in 2007 on Santa Rosa Island in California and published in March 2009.

## Care Guide
Orange Lichen needs bright, direct light and intermittent moisture, mimicking natural rainfall and drying cycles. Avoid traditional soil watering and fertilization, as it absorbs nutrients directly from its environment and prefers lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low; naturally obtains nutrients from airborne dust, rainwater, and its substrate. No supplemental fertilization is typically needed or recommended, as excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
