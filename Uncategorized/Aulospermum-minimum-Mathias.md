### *Aulospermum minimum Mathias*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Asia, specifically mountainous and steppe regions of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to semi-arid montane and steppe. Characterized by dry, hot summers, cold winters, and often rocky, well-drained soils. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. This plant thrives in open, exposed environments with high light intensity, typical of its native montane steppes. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic its native arid climate and prevent root rot. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Aulospermum Minimum thrives in full sun, reflecting its native arid montane habitat. It requires deep, infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum, as it is adapted to lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils, this plant requires minimal fertilization. If necessary, use a balanced, diluted fertilizer very sparingly during the growing season.
