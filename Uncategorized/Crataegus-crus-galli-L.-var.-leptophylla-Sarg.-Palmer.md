## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
This plant prefers full sun to partial shade and thrives in well-drained soil, mirroring its native habitat on woodland edges. It requires moderate watering, particularly when young, though it becomes quite drought-tolerant once established. Fertilizer needs are typically low.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial in poor soils, but often not strictly necessary in fertile garden soil.
