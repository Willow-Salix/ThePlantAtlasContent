## Care Guide
The White Fringetree thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is a relatively low-maintenance plant, needing minimal fertilization if planted in rich, organic soil, and benefits from afternoon shade in hot climates.

### Fertilizer
Low. Generally thrives in average to rich, well-drained soils with good organic content. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial for young plants or those in very poor soils.
