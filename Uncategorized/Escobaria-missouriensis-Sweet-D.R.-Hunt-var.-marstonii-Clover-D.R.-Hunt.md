## Care Guide
This resilient cactus thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage. Water infrequently during the growing season, ensuring the soil dries out completely, and reduce watering drastically in winter. Provide light fertilization during spring and summer to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a low-nitrogen cactus formula during the active growing season (spring/summer). No fertilizer in fall/winter.
