## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Rocky Mountains region (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Idaho, Alberta, British Columbia). |
| **Climate** | Alpine/Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun; thrives in open, exposed locations characteristic of high-altitude environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to Low watering; adapted to well-drained, often rocky soils, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It tolerates drought once established. |

## Introduction
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## Care Guide
The Rocky Mountain Bluegrass flourishes in full to partial sun with excellent drainage, preferring rocky or gravelly soil. It requires moderate to low watering, tolerating dry conditions once established, and needs minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; accustomed to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
