## 🌱 Overview
Olea ( OH-lee-ə) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Oleaceae. It includes 12 species native to warm temperate and tropical regions of the Middle East, southern Europe, Africa, southern Asia, and Australasia. They are evergreen trees and shrubs, with small, opposite, entire leaves. The fruit is a drupe. Leaves of Olea contain trichosclereids.
For humans, the most important and familiar species is by far the olive (Olea europaea), native to the Mediterranean region, Africa, southwest Asia, and the Himalayas, which is the type species of the genus. The native olive (O. paniculata) is a larger tree, attaining a height of 15–18 m in the forests of Queensland, and yielding a hard and tough timber. The yet harder wood of the black ironwood O. capensis, an inhabitant of Natal, is important in South Africa.
Olea species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including double-striped pug.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The African Wild Olive is a resilient, drought-tolerant tree that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. It requires infrequent, deep watering once established and benefits from minimal fertilization. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging and root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is typically sufficient, particularly if planted in poor or depleted soils.
