## 🌱 Overview
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rock-dwelling lichen thrives in dry, sunny environments, mirroring its native arid habitats. It requires high light exposure and extremely infrequent watering, absorbing moisture directly from the atmosphere or occasional rain. No traditional fertilization is needed, as it extracts nutrients from the air and its rock substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens obtain nutrients directly from air, dust, and the rock substrate.
