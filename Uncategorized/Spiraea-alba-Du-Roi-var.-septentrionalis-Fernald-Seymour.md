## Introduction
Spiraea , sometimes spelled spirea in common names, and commonly known as meadowsweets or steeplebushes, is a genus of about 80 to 100 species of shrubs in the family Rosaceae. They are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest diversity in eastern Asia.
The genus formerly included the herbaceous species now segregated into the genera Filipendula and Aruncus; recent genetic evidence has shown that Filipendula is only distantly related to Spiraea, belonging in the subfamily Rosoideae.

## Care Guide
Northern White Spiraea thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, characteristic of its native temperate wetland habitats. It prefers full sun to partial shade and requires only low to moderate fertilization to support its growth, ensuring continuous moisture is the primary focus.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typically sufficient with a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer application in spring if soil quality is poor, as its native soils can vary.
