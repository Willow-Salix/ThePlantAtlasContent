## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Americas, particularly Peru and Central America |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light. Direct sun, especially in the afternoon, can scorch leaves, reflecting its understory habitat. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, mimicking consistent tropical rainfall with good drainage. |

## Introduction
Pachystachys is a genus of 12 species of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae, native to rainforest in the Caribbean and Central and South America. They are evergreen perennials and shrubs bearing prominent terminal spikes of flowers with brightly coloured bracts.
The name Pachystachys comes from the Greek for "thick spike", referring to the flower heads. The genus is closely related to Justicia.
The species P. coccinea, P. lutea and P. spicata are found in cultivation. They can be grown outside in subtropical gardens in areas where the temperature does not fall below 10 °C (50 °F). Elsewhere, they can be grown under glass or as houseplants.

## Care Guide
The Lollipop Plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light, mirroring its tropical rainforest understory origins. Ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained, and provide regular fertilization during its active growing period for optimal health and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high nutrient needs during the growing season. Fertilize every 2-4 weeks with a balanced liquid fertilizer, reflecting the continuous nutrient cycling in rainforests.
