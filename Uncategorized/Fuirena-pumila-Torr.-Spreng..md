## Care Guide
This wetland sedge thrives in full to partial sun and demands consistently wet, even saturated, soil conditions, mirroring its native bog and marsh habitats. It is crucial that the soil never dries out. Provide light to moderate fertilization during its active growth phase.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied monthly during the growing season, but it does not require overly rich soil.
