## 🧤 Care Instructions
Haematomma persoonii is a lichen adapted to the humid, shaded environments of tropical and subtropical forests. It thrives with high ambient moisture and indirect light, absorbing water and minimal nutrients directly from the atmosphere. Avoid strong direct sunlight and the use of concentrated fertilizers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely minimal; primarily obtains nutrients from airborne particles and rainfall. High concentrations of fertilizer are detrimental.
