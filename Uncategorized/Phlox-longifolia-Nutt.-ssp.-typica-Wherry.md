## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (primarily Western United States and parts of Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Semi-Arid Grassland/Shrubland and dry woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive) |
| **Watering** | Low to Moderate. Drought-tolerant once established; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Phlox (; Ancient Greek: φλόξ "flame"; plural "phlox" or "phloxes", Ancient Greek: φλόγες phlóges) is a genus of 68 species of perennial and annual plants in the family Polemoniaceae. They are found mostly in North America (one in Siberia) in diverse habitats from alpine tundra to open woodland and prairie. Some flower in spring, others in summer and fall. Flowers may be pale blue, violet, pink, bright red, or white. Many are fragrant.

## Care Guide
Longleaf Phlox thrives in conditions mimicking its native Western North American semi-arid grasslands. It requires full sun and well-drained soil, tolerating drought once established with infrequent watering. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to leaner soils.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soils; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or none at all if soil is naturally fertile.
