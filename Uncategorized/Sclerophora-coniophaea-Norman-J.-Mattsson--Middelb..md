## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including Northern Europe (e.g., Norway, Sweden, Finland), Central Europe, and parts of North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forest (old-growth), characterized by moderate rainfall, cool to mild temperatures, and high ambient humidity. |
| **Sunlight** | Low to indirect light, thriving in dappled shade or under dense forest canopy. Avoid direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity is crucial. Absorbs moisture from the air and rainfall; no traditional watering. Regular misting or placement in a humid environment would be beneficial if cultivated. |

## Care Guide
To care for Sclerophora coniophaea, provide a stable environment with low to indirect light and consistently high humidity, mimicking its native old-growth forest habitat. Avoid direct sun and never apply traditional fertilizers, as these can be detrimental to its growth.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is needed or recommended, as lichens derive nutrients from the air and substrate. Fertilizers can be harmful.
