## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cactus, often considered a synonym of Coryphantha ramillosa, thrives in conditions mimicking its arid Mexican origins, requiring abundant sunlight and very well-draining soil. Water sparingly during its growing period and keep it dry in winter to prevent rot, ensuring minimal fertilization for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Apply a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer). Avoid fertilizing during dormancy.
