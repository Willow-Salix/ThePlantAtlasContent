# Florida Lopholejeunea

*Lopholejeunea muelleriana (Gottsche) Schiffn. ssp. floridana R.M. Schust.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern USA, primarily Florida |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. Prefers dappled shade or consistently shaded conditions, mimicking its natural habitat under a tree canopy or in crevices. |
| **Watering** | Consistently high humidity and frequent moisture. Requires regular misting or placement in a terrarium to maintain high ambient humidity. The substrate (bark or rock) should remain moist but never waterlogged. |

## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in conditions of very high humidity and consistent moisture, typical of its humid subtropical native environment. Provide low to moderate indirect light, avoiding any direct sun exposure to prevent drying. Fertilization should be minimal, if any, to replicate its natural nutrient uptake from rainfall.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. As an epiphyte, it primarily derives nutrients from rainfall and decaying organic matter. If fertilized, use a very weak, diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/10th strength) sparingly.
