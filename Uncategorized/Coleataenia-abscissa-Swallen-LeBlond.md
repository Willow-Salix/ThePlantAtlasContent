## Care Guide
This tropical grass thrives in consistently moist to wet soil and requires full sun exposure. Provide regular watering to prevent drying out and offer moderate fertilization during its active growing season to support robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer). Less may be needed if planted in naturally rich, organic soils.
