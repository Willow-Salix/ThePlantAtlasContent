## Care Guide
California Everlasting thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering during cooler months and very little during dry summers. Fertilization needs are low, making it a low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor or disturbed soils and does not require heavy fertilization. An annual light feeding, if at all, is sufficient.
