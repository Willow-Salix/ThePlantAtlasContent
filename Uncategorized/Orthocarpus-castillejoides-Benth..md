## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions of California and Oregon, USA |
| **Climate** | Wet Coastal Scrubland/Grassland (specifically salt marshes and vernal pools) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day), mimicking its open marsh and meadow habitats. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil, especially during its active growing season (late winter to spring). Tolerates seasonal waterlogging or inundation, but avoid prolonged dry periods during growth. |

## Introduction
Orthocarpus, or owl's-clover,  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae (broomrapes). They are native to North America. A number of species formerly included in Orthocarpus have been transferred to the genus Castilleja, which includes the plants commonly known as Indian paintbrush. Plants of the genus are generally less than 30 centimetres (1 ft) in height.
Like their close relatives in genus Castilleja, Orthocarpus are root hemiparasites, capable of photosynthesis but extracting water and mineral nutrients through attachment to the roots of host plants.
Some animal species such as the Edith's checkerspot butterfly use these plants as hosts during ovipositing.

## Care Guide
Seaside Owl's Clover thrives in full sun and demands consistently moist to wet soil conditions, particularly during its spring growth and bloom, reflecting its native coastal marsh and vernal pool environments. It is adapted to lean soils and benefits from minimal to no fertilization due to its hemiparasitic nature.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required, as it is adapted to often nutrient-poor, saline soils and is hemiparasitic, drawing nutrients from host plants.
