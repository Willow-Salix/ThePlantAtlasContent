## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Rocky Mountains of western North America (USA, specifically Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its high-altitude, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. It prefers well-draining soil and can tolerate periods of drought once established, similar to its rocky native environment. Avoid waterlogged conditions. |

## Care Guide
To care for Alpine False Goldenaster, provide abundant full sun and well-draining soil to mimic its native alpine environment. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing to maintain its compact growth and vibrant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to lean, rocky alpine soils and does not require heavy fertilization. Excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
