## 🌱 Overview
Chenopodium is a genus of numerous species of perennial or annual herbaceous flowering plants known as the goosefoot, which occur almost anywhere in the world. It is placed in the family Amaranthaceae in the APG II system; older classification systems, notably the widely used Cronquist system, separate it and its relatives as Chenopodiaceae, but this leaves the rest of the Amaranthaceae polyphyletic. However, among the Amaranthaceae, the genus Chenopodium is the namesake member of the subfamily Chenopodioideae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable plant thrives in full sun conditions and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. It is tolerant of various soil types and generally needs minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance species suitable for open, disturbed areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season if the soil is poor.
