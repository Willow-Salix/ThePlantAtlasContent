## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Southern United States (e.g., Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Savanna |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open fields and prairies. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Drought-tolerant once established; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Aristida is a very nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. Aristida is distinguished by having three awns (bristles) on each lemma of each floret. The genus includes about 300 species found worldwide, often in arid warm regions. This genus is among those colloquially called three-awns wiregrasses, speargrasses and needlegrasses. The name Aristida is derived from the Latin "arista", meaning "awn".
They are characteristic of semiarid grassland. The Wiregrass Region of North America is named for A. stricta. Other locales where this genus is an important component of the ecosystem include the Carolina Bays, the sandhills of the Carolinas, and elsewhere, Mulga scrub in Australia, and the xeric grasslands around Lake Turkana in Africa. Local increases in the abundance of wiregrasses is a good indicator of overgrazing, as livestock avoid them.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This native grass is highly adaptable to full sun and well-drained soils. Once established, it is very drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering. It thrives with low fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant suitable for prairie or naturalized landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Generally thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils characteristic of native grasslands. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient, or often no fertilizer is needed.
