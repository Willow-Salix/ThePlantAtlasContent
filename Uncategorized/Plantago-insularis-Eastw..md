## Introduction
Plantago is a genus of about 200 species of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae, commonly called plantains or fleaworts. The common name plantain is shared with the unrelated cooking plantain. Most are herbaceous plants, though a few are subshrubs growing to 60 centimetres (24 inches) tall.

## Care Guide
This desert plant requires full sun exposure and is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering with well-draining soil. It thrives in lean conditions, so fertilizer needs are minimal to none, mimicking its arid native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Very low; thrives in poor, nutrient-deficient soils. Fertilization is generally not required or can be done very sparingly with a diluted, balanced fertilizer if growth seems stunted.
