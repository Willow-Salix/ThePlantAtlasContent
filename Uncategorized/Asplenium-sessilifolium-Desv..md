## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Greater Antilles (Hispaniola, Cuba, Puerto Rico) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Wet Forests and Cloud Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in low to indirect bright light, mimicking its native habitat under a dense canopy or in crevices. Avoid direct sunlight which can scorch fronds. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture; keep the substrate evenly moist but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. High ambient humidity is crucial and can be maintained through misting or a pebble tray. |

## Introduction
Asplenium is a genus of about 700 species of ferns, often treated as the only genus in the family Aspleniaceae, though other authors consider Hymenasplenium separate, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, a different chromosome count, and structural differences in the rhizomes. The type species for the genus is Asplenium marinum.
The most common vernacular name is spleenworts, applied to the more "typical" species. A. nidus and several similar species are called bird's-nest ferns, the Camptosorus group is known as walking ferns, and distinct names are applied to some other particularly well-known species.

## Care Guide
This fern thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical montane wet forests, requiring low to indirect bright light and consistently moist substrate with high humidity. Fertilize lightly during the growing season to support its moderate nutrient needs and ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from light fertilization. Apply a diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., half-strength) every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
