## Care Guide
This temperate meadow plant thrives in full sun and moderate moisture, reflecting its native open habitats. It is relatively adaptable, requiring minimal fertilizer once established, making it a low-maintenance choice for open, sunny locations.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average meadow soils, so a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly, especially if the soil is poor.
