## Introduction
The Cyperaceae () are a family of  graminoid (grass-like), monocotyledonous flowering plants known as sedges. The family is large; botanists have described some 5,500 known species in about 90 genera – the largest being the "true sedges" (genus Carex), with over 2,000 species.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in consistently wet soil, mimicking its native bog and marsh environment. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil never dries out. It has low to moderate nutrient needs, so avoid over-fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as many bog and marsh soils are naturally poor to moderately rich in nutrients.
