## Introduction
Zephyranthes  is a genus of temperate and tropical bulbous plants in the Amaryllis family, subfamily Amaryllidoideae, native to the Americas and widely cultivated as ornamentals. Following the expansion of the genus in 2019, which now includes the genera Habranthus and Sprekelia, there are about 200 recognized species, as well as numerous hybrids and cultivars. Common names for species in this genus include fairy lily, rainflower, zephyr lily, magic lily, Atamasco lily,  and rain lily.
The name is derived from Ζέφυρος (Zephyrus), the Greek god of the west wind, and ἄνθος (anthos), meaning flower, referring to the slender stalks.

## Care Guide
The Atamasco Lily thrives in its native humid subtropical conditions with full sun to partial shade. It requires consistent moisture during its active spring and summer growth, often blooming after rainfall, and benefits from light fertilization. Allow for a drier period during winter dormancy.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced fertilizer in early spring as new growth emerges, especially in poorer soils. Generally not a heavy feeder.
