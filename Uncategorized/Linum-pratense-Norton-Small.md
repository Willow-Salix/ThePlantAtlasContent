## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Western United States (e.g., Great Plains, Intermountain West) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Semi-Arid Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open prairie habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings; drought-tolerant once established, mimicking natural rainfall patterns of temperate grasslands. |

## Introduction
Linum (flax) is a genus of approximately 200 species in the flowering plant family Linaceae. They are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the world. The genus includes the common flax (L. usitatissimum), the bast fibre of which is used to produce linen and the seeds to produce linseed oil.

The flowers of most species are blue or yellow, rarely red, white, or pink, and some are heterostylous. There is an average of 6 to 10 seeds per boll.
Linum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the cabbage moth, the nutmeg, the setaceous Hebrew character and Coleophora striolatella, which feeds exclusively on Linum narbonense.

## Care Guide
Meadow flax requires full sun and well-draining soil, similar to its native grassland environment. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and fertilize sparingly as it is adapted to leaner, natural nutrient levels.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average, well-draining soil without excessive fertilization, adapted to natural nutrient cycles of prairies.
