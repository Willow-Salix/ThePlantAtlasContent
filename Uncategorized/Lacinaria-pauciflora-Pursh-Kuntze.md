## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (specifically open woodlands, savannas, pine flatwoods) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), mimicking its open habitat in native savannas and flatwoods. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during the growing season, allowing the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. It tolerates some drought once established, especially in well-draining soils. |

## 🌱 Overview
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils, reflective of its native open, humid subtropical environments. Water regularly during the growing season, letting the soil dry slightly, and use fertilizer sparingly as it's adapted to less fertile conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial in poor soils, but over-fertilizing should be avoided as it thrives in naturally lean conditions.
