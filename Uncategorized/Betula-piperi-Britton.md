## Introduction
Betula papyrifera (paper birch, also known as (American) white birch and canoe birch) is a short-lived species of birch native to northern North America. Paper birch is named after the tree's thin white bark, which often peels in paper-like layers from the trunk. Paper birch is often one of the first species to colonize a burned area within the northern latitudes, and is an important species for moose browsing. Primary commercial uses for paper birch wood are as boltwood and sawlogs, while secondary products include firewood and pulpwood. It is the provincial tree of Saskatchewan and the state tree of New Hampshire.

## Care Guide
This birch species, known as Paper Birch, thrives in cold temperate climates with ample sunlight. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and benefits from moderate fertility. Ensure adequate watering during dry periods, particularly for young trees.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if the soil is poor or growth appears weak.
