## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tree Clubmoss thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, replicating its native temperate forest floor habitat. It requires consistently moist, well-drained, acidic soil and benefits from light, infrequent fertilization. Protect it from direct sunlight and maintain high ambient humidity.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization, if any, during the growing season. A diluted balanced liquid fertilizer or organic top-dressing is suitable.
