## Introduction
Asclepias is a genus of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants known as milkweeds, named for their latex, a milky substance containing cardiac glycosides termed cardenolides, exuded where cells are damaged. Most species are toxic to humans and many other species, primarily due to the presence of cardenolides. However, as with many such plants, some species feed upon milkweed leaves or the nectar from their flowers. A noteworthy feeder on milkweeds is the monarch butterfly, which uses and requires certain milkweeds as host plants for its larvae.
The Asclepias genus contains over 200 species distributed broadly across Africa, North America, and South America. It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.

## Care Guide
Decumbent Milkweed thrives in full sun to partial shade, reflecting its native temperate grassland habitat. It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, becoming somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilizer is typically not a high priority, especially in healthy garden soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not required in average garden soil. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil is poor.
