## Care Guide
Fourwing Saltbush is a robust, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained, poor soils, reflecting its native arid and semi-arid scrubland origins. It requires minimal watering once established and generally needs no fertilization. Overwatering and rich soils should be avoided to ensure its health.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Naturally adapted to poor, often saline, soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary and can be detrimental.
