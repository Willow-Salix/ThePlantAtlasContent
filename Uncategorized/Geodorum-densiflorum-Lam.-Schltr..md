## Introduction
Geodorum, commonly known as shepherds' crooks or 地宝兰属 (di bao lan shu), is a genus of eight species of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. They are deciduous, terrestrial herbs with underground pseudobulbs, broad, pleated leaves and small to medium-sized, tube-shaped or bell-shaped flowers on a flowering stem with a drooping end.

## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid thrives in warm, humid conditions with dappled light, mimicking its native tropical forest floor habitat. It requires consistent moisture during its growing season, along with good drainage, and appreciates moderate fertilization. Ensure high humidity and protect from direct, harsh sunlight to promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Apply a balanced, diluted orchid-specific fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Reduce or cease feeding during dormancy.
