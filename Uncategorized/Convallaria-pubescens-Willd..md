## Introduction
Maianthemum canadense (Canadian may-lily, Canada mayflower, false lily-of-the-valley, Canadian lily-of-the-valley, wild lily-of-the-valley, two-leaved Solomon's seal)
is an understory perennial flowering plant, native to Canada and the northeastern United States, from Yukon and British Columbia east to Newfoundland, into St. Pierre and Miquelon. It can be found growing in both coniferous and deciduous forests. The plant appears in two forms, either as a single leaf rising from the ground with no fruiting structures or as a flowering/fruiting stem with two to three leaves. Flowering shoots have clusters of 12–25 starry-shaped, white flowers held above the leaves.
The plant is rich in calcium and phosphorus and as such makes up the bulk of the diet of white-tailed deer in the northeastern United States in the spring, when lactating does and antler-growing bucks require extra amounts of those nutrients.

## Care Guide
Canada Mayflower thrives as an understory plant in cool, moist temperate forests. Provide partial to full shade, consistently moist, well-draining soil rich in organic matter, and protect from intense direct sun for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from organically rich soil; a light application of balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer or compost in spring is sufficient.
