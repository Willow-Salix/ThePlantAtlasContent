## Introduction
Dicranum is a genus of mosses, also called wind-blown mosses or fork mosses. 
These mosses form in densely packed clumps. Stems may fork, but do not branch. In general, upright stems will be single but packed together. Dicranum is distributed globally. In North America these are commonly found in Jack pine or Red pine stands.

## Care Guide
This forest-dwelling moss thrives in cool, shaded, and consistently humid environments. Ensure its substrate remains moist but not saturated, and always avoid direct sunlight. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as high nutrient levels can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to no fertilizer needed. Mosses are sensitive to high nutrient concentrations and can be harmed by standard plant fertilizers.
