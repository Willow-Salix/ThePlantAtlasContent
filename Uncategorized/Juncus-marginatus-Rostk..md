## Care Guide
Grassleaf Rush thrives in very wet conditions, requiring consistently moist to wet soil and tolerating standing water. It prefers full sun to partial shade for robust growth. Fertilizer needs are low, with infrequent light feeding during the active growing season.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced liquid fertilizer can be given sparingly during the growing season, or it may not require significant fertilization in rich, boggy soil.
