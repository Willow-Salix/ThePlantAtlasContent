| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, as it typically grows in open fields, rocky hillsides, or forest margins. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering during its active growing season, but it is tolerant of dry periods given its native climate has distinct wet and dry seasons. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
This grass thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical savanna origin, preferring full to partial sun and well-draining soil. It requires regular watering during its active growth but can withstand dry spells. Fertilization is generally not critical due to its adaptation to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer is needed, as it is adapted to the often nutrient-poor soils of its native savanna. A light, balanced fertilizer application once or twice during the growing season would suffice if desired, but is not strictly necessary.
