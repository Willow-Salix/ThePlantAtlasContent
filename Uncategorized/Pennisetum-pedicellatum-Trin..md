## Introduction
Cenchrus is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family, native to tropical and warm temperate regions of the world. Its species are native to many countries in Asia, Africa, Australia, the Americas, and various oceanic islands.
Common names include buffelgrasses, sandburs, and sand spur. Such names allude to the sharp, spine-covered burrs characterizing the inflorescences of the members of the genus. Those previously classified as Pennisetum  are known commonly as fountaingrasses (fountain grasses).

## Care Guide
Kyasuma grass thrives in full sun and warm temperatures, preferring moist, well-drained soil during its active growth. Reflecting its savanna origins, it is quite adaptable, tolerating some drought once established, and benefits from moderate fertilization to support vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced fertilizer application once or twice during the active growing season, especially in nutrient-poor soils.
