## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Japan, Korea, and northeastern China |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade, especially protected from harsh afternoon sun. It can tolerate more sun in cooler, moist climates but thrives in the dappled light of a forest understory. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking the conditions of its native forest floor. Water regularly, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly between waterings, but avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cephalotaxus, commonly called plum yew or cowtail pine, is a genus of conifers comprising 11 species, either considered the only member of the family Cephalotaxaceae, or in the Taxaceae when that family is considered in a broad sense. The genus is endemic to eastern Asia, though fossil evidence shows it had a wider Northern Hemisphere distribution in the past. The species are evergreen shrubs and small trees reaching 1.0–10 metres (3–33 ft) (rarely to 20 metres (66 ft)) tall.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This evergreen shrub flourishes in conditions reminiscent of its native temperate forest, requiring partial to full shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide regular watering and light fertilization in spring to support its healthy growth, protecting it from intense direct sunlight.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from light feeding. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, or incorporate organic compost to enrich the soil, similar to the natural nutrient cycling in a forest.
