## Introduction
Avena is a genus of Eurasian and African plants in the grass family. Collectively known as the oats, they include some species which have been cultivated for thousands of years as a food source for humans and livestock. They are widespread throughout Europe, Asia and northwest Africa. Several species have become naturalized in many parts of the world, and are regarded as invasive weeds where they compete with crop production. All oats have edible seeds, though they are small and hard to harvest in most species.

## Care Guide
Wild Oat thrives in full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with its open-field habitat. It needs moderate watering during its active growth season, adapting well to periods of summer drought. Moderately fertile soil supports optimal growth for this adaptable plant.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderately fertile soil. Can adapt to various soil types but thrives in soils with moderate nutrient availability, typical of agricultural or disturbed lands.
