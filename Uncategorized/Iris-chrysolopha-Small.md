## Care Guide
This wetland iris thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently wet soil, mimicking its native boggy habitat. Provide moderate fertilization during spring to support vigorous growth, ensuring its water needs are met year-round.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season (spring), especially if soil is not naturally rich.
