## Care Guide
Hemigraphis thrives in warm, humid conditions with consistently moist soil and bright, indirect light, much like its native rainforest floor. Provide regular watering and moderate fertilization during active growth to maintain its vibrant foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring through summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, perhaps every 2-4 weeks. Less or no fertilizer in fall and winter.
