## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (including Alaska, Yukon, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and California) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine to Alpine Tundra/Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial shade to filtered light; can tolerate more direct sun in cooler, high-altitude environments but needs protection from intense midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its naturally moist, high-elevation habitat. |

## Introduction
Athyrium (lady-fern) is a genus of about 180 species of terrestrial ferns, with a cosmopolitan distribution.  It is placed in the family Athyriaceae, in the order Polypodiales.
Its genus name is from Greek a- ('without') and Latinized Greek thyreos ('shield'), describing its inconspicuous indusium (sorus' covering).
The common name "lady fern" refers in particular to the common lady fern, Athyrium filix-femina.
Athyrium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the small angle shades and Sthenopis auratus.

## Care Guide
This fern thrives in cool, moist, and shady conditions, mirroring its native subalpine to alpine environment. Ensure consistently moist, well-drained soil and protect it from intense direct sun, particularly in warmer climates. Fertilize sparingly to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the growing season (spring/early summer), or a slow-release granular fertilizer in spring.
