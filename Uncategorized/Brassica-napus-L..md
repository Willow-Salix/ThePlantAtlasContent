| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean region and Western Europe |
| **Climate** | Temperate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), typical of open fields in its native range. |

## Introduction
Rapeseed (Brassica napus subsp. napus), also known as rape and oilseed rape and canola, is a bright-yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae (mustard or cabbage family), cultivated mainly for its oil-rich seed, which naturally contains appreciable amounts of mildly toxic erucic acid. The term "canola" denotes a group of rapeseed cultivars that were bred to have very low levels of erucic acid and which are especially prized for use as human and animal food. Rapeseed is the third-largest source of vegetable oil and the second-largest source of protein meal in the world.

## Care Guide
Rape thrives in full sun and rich, well-draining soil, requiring consistent moisture during its active growth phases. Regular fertilization is crucial to support its robust development and significant seed production.

### Fertilizer
High nutrient needs, especially nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, consistent with its vigorous growth as an agricultural crop that depletes soil nutrients.
