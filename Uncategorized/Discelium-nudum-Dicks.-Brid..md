## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate to boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate (specifically, open, disturbed, and consistently moist bare ground habitats within this biome). |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun; avoid intense, scorching direct sun that can rapidly dry out its substrate. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist, ensuring the substrate does not dry out completely, but also allowing for good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
Discelium moss prefers cool, temperate conditions with consistent moisture and bright indirect light to partial sun. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, well-draining yet damp substrates, typical of its pioneer nature on disturbed ground. Maintain humidity and avoid rich fertilizers for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; this species thrives in nutrient-poor conditions and typically does not require supplemental feeding.
