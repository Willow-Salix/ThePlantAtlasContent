## Introduction
Racopilum is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Racopilaceae.
The species of this genus are found in Southern Hemisphere.
The genus name of Racopilum refers to the combination of two Greek words; rhakos meaning rag or remnant, and also pilos meaning felt cap, which alludes to basally torn calyptra (cap-like structure) of some taxa.

## Care Guide
Racopilum moss thrives in high humidity and low to medium indirect light, mirroring its native tropical forest environment. Ensure the growing medium is consistently moist without being waterlogged, and mist regularly to maintain high ambient humidity. Fertilization requirements are very low or often unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal. If used, apply a very diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/8 strength) very sparingly.
