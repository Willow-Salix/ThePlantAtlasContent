# Fabronia Moss

*Fabronia ciliaris (Brid.) Brid. var. ciliaris* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and warm-temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to filtered light. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can scorch the moss. |
| **Watering** | Maintain consistently high humidity and moisture. Regular misting, a humid environment like a terrarium, or placement in a high-humidity location is essential. The moss should be kept damp but not waterlogged. |

## Care Guide
This epiphytic moss thrives in high humidity and filtered light conditions, mimicking its forest understory origin. Consistent moisture through regular misting or a humid environment is crucial for its survival. Fertilization is generally unnecessary and should be avoided.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses are highly efficient at nutrient absorption from their environment and do not typically require fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
