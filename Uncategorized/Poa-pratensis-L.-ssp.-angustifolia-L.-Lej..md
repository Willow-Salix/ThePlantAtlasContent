## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate Eurasia (Europe and Asia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving best with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily typical of open meadows. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, mimicking temperate rainfall patterns. Requires consistent moisture during active growth but can tolerate short dry periods once established. |

## Introduction
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in open, sunny to partially shaded conditions with moderate, consistent watering. Native to temperate grasslands, it benefits from regular, but not excessive, fertilization to maintain vigor. Ensure good drainage and avoid waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilizer needs, reflecting typical grassland soils. Benefits from balanced fertilization during growing seasons to support dense growth.
