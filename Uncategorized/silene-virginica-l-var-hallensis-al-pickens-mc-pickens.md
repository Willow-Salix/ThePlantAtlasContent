## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fire Pink thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate forest habitat, requiring partial to full sun exposure and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is a relatively low-maintenance plant, benefiting from light fertilization primarily during its active growing season to support vibrant blooming.
