## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Asia (including India and Southeast Asia) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Monsoon/Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Shade, preferring Full Sun for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; requires regular water during its active growing season, but is tolerant of drier periods once established, reflecting its adaptation to distinct wet and dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Crotalaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae (subfamily Faboideae) commonly known as rattlepods. The genus includes over 700 species of herbaceous plants and shrubs. Africa is the continent with the majority of Crotalaria species (approximately 400 species), which are mainly found in damp grassland, especially in floodplains, depressions and along edges of swamps and rivers, but also in deciduous bush land, roadsides and fields. Some species of Crotalaria are grown as ornamentals. The common name rattlepod or rattlebox is derived from the fact that the seeds become loose in the pod as they mature, and rattle when the pod is shaken. The name derives from the Ancient Greek κρόταλον, meaning "castanet", and is the same root as the name for the rattlesnakes (Crotalus).
Crotalaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Endoclita sericeus, Etiella zinckenella and Utetheisa ornatrix. The toxic alkaloids produced by some members of this genus are known to be incorporated by Utetheisia larvae and used to secure their defense from predators.

## Care Guide
Spotted Rattlepod thrives in tropical climates, preferring full sun and moderate watering that allows for slight drying between sessions. As a nitrogen-fixing plant, it has low fertilizer needs and can flourish in a variety of soil types.

### Fertilizer
Low; as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil and does not require heavy fertilization. Minimal or no supplemental fertilizer is typically needed.
