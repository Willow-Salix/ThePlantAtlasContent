| **🌍 Origin** | Europe, Asia, and North Africa, particularly common in the Mediterranean Basin. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate and Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, as they thrive in open fields and disturbed ground. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during their active growth phase to keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged; drought-tolerant once established, especially as they mature. |

## 🌱 Overview
Papaver rhoeas, with common names including common poppy, corn poppy, corn rose, field poppy, Flanders poppy, red poppy, and Odai, is an annual herbaceous species of flowering plant in the poppy family Papaveraceae. It is native to north Africa and temperate Eurasia and is introduced into temperate areas on all other continents except Antarctica.
It is regarded as an agricultural weed (hence the common names including "corn" and "field"). As the plant thrives in areas of disturbed soil, it was often abundant in agricultural fields before the advent of herbicides. Flushes of poppies may still appear in fields where herbicides are not used, as well as those in fallow. The corn poppy and its cultivars such as the Shirley poppy are widely grown in gardens, and are frequently found in packets of seed labelled "wildflower mixes". Since World War I, it has been used in the Commonwealth as a symbol of remembrance for fallen soldiers because it commonly grew in fields disturbed by war.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Corn Poppies are sun-loving annuals that thrive in open, disturbed areas. Provide full sun and moderate water, ensuring good drainage, and avoid over-fertilization to encourage abundant blooms. They are relatively low-maintenance once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; native soils are often average to poor, so excessive fertilization can lead to lush foliage but fewer flowers. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer at planting or none in fertile soil is usually sufficient.
