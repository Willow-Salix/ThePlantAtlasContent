## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate and montane regions across Europe, North America, Central America, and North Africa |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate Montane, often found in shaded rock crevices or on bark in moist environments |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. Prefers shaded conditions to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity and regular atmospheric moisture (rain, mist, dew). Does not require traditional soil watering as it lacks roots. |

## Introduction
Ionaspis is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Hymeneliaceae. It contains six species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), crustose lichens. The genus was originally circumscribed in 1871 by Theodor Magnus Fries. He segregated the genus from Aspicilia based on the presence of Trentepohlia rather than Trebouxia as the photobiont partner.

## Care Guide
As a saxicolous (rock-dwelling) lichen, Ionaspis heteromorpha thrives in consistently humid and shaded environments with good air circulation. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and rain, requiring no traditional watering or fertilization, but benefits from high ambient humidity and protection from direct sun.

### Fertilizer
No external fertilization typically required. Nutrients are absorbed from atmospheric deposition and the substrate.
