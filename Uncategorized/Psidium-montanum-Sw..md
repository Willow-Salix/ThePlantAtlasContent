| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate more direct sun if humidity is high and moisture is consistent. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage, mimicking the regular rainfall and high humidity of its native cloud forest environment. Avoid drought and waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Psidium is a genus of trees and shrubs in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to warmer parts of the Western Hemisphere (Mexico, Central and South America, the West Indies, and the Galápagos islands). Many of the species bear edible fruits, and for this reason several are cultivated commercially. The most popularly cultivated species is the common guava, Psidium guajava.

## Care Guide
The Mountain Guava requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and high humidity, replicating its native montane forest conditions. Provide bright indirect to partial sun exposure and feed moderately during the growing season for best results.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release or liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in cooler months.
