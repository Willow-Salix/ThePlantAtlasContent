## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States, particularly the Appalachian Mountains (from Alabama to Pennsylvania and Ohio). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade, especially afternoon shade. It thrives in the dappled light conditions found in forest understories. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular watering is crucial, especially during dry spells, reflecting its natural habitat along stream banks and moist woodland areas. |

## Introduction
Aconitum (), also known as aconite, monkshood, wolfsbane, leopard's bane, devil's helmet, or blue rocket, is a genus of over 250 species of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. These herbaceous, frequently toxic perennial plants are chiefly native to the mountainous parts of the Northern Hemisphere in North America, Europe, and Asia, growing in the moisture-retentive but well-draining soils of mountain meadows.
Most Aconitum species are extremely poisonous and must be handled very carefully.  Several Aconitum hybrids, such as the Arendsii form of Aconitum carmichaelii, have won gardening awards—such as the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Some are used by florists.

## Care Guide
Southern Blue Monkshood flourishes in cool, moist, and shaded environments, mimicking its native woodland habitat. Ensure the soil remains consistently damp and is rich in organic matter with good drainage, while protecting it from harsh afternoon sun. An annual application of compost or a balanced fertilizer in spring supports robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Prefers organically rich soil. Amend with compost annually in spring, or apply a balanced slow-release granular fertilizer at the beginning of the growing season.
