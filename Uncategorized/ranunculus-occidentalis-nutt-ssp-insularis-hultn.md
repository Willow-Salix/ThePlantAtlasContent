## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically coastal areas and islands from British Columbia south to Oregon |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Maritime Climate, found in coastal meadows, grasslands, and open woodlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Thrives in full sun to partial shade, reflecting its native habitat in exposed coastal areas or under light tree canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate watering; keep soil consistently moist during its active growing season (spring), allowing the top inch to dry out slightly between waterings during warmer months. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ranunculus  is a large genus of about 1750 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Members of the genus are known as buttercups, spearworts and water crowfoots.
The genus is distributed worldwide, primarily in temperate and montane regions. The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, which has extremely tough and tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much taller meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris. In ornamental  gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.
Buttercups usually flower in the spring, but flowers may be found throughout the summer, especially where the plants are growing as opportunistic colonizers, as in the case of garden weeds.
The water crowfoots (Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium), which grow in still or running water, are sometimes treated in a separate genus Batrachium (from Greek βάτραχος bátrakhos, "frog"). They have two different leaf types, thread-like leaves underwater and broader floating leaves. In some species, such as R. aquatilis, a third, intermediate leaf type occurs.
Ranunculus species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Hebrew character and small angle shades. Some species are popular ornamental flowers in horticulture, with many cultivars selected for large and brightly coloured flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Island Western Buttercup prefers a temperate maritime climate with full sun to partial shade. It requires consistent moisture during its spring growth but can tolerate slightly drier conditions in summer. A light annual feeding in spring is sufficient to encourage healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Apply a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer once in early spring to support its growth cycle, as native soils are typically not overly rich.
