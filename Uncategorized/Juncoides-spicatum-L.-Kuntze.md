## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including mountainous areas of Europe, Asia, and North America (e.g., Alps, Himalayas, Rocky Mountains). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Montane regions. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in bright, open conditions characteristic of high-altitude environments often above the treeline. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist but very well-drained soil, mimicking the melting snow and rocky soils of its native habitat; avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Luzula spicata is a species of flowering plant in the rush family known by the common name spiked woodrush. It has a circumpolar distribution, occurring throughout the northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, and North America. It grows in subalpine and alpine climates. It occurs at low elevations in colder regions, such as tundra; further south it is restricted mainly to high mountains. It is a perennial herb forming grasslike clumps of several upright, reddish stems up to about 33 centimeters in maximum height. The stem is thick and its base is buried several centimeters in the soil where it attaches to the roots. The inflorescence is an array of several clusters of brown bristle-tipped flowers. The surrounding bracts and the sheaths encircling the leaf bases are lined with hairs.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant requires cool temperatures and ample light, replicating its high-altitude origins. Ensure consistently moist, well-draining soil and provide minimal fertilization to prevent over-enrichment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs; native soils are typically lean. A balanced, diluted fertilizer applied once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
