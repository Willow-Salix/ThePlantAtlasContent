## Care Guide
This montane plant thrives in bright, open conditions with well-draining soil. Water moderately during its active growth, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and fertilize sparingly in spring. Emulating its native dry summer dormancy is crucial for its health.

Low to moderate fertilization is sufficient, apply a balanced, diluted fertilizer sparingly during the spring growing season.
