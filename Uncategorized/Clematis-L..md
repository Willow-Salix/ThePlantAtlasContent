## Care Guide
Clematis thrives in locations offering full sun to partial shade while ensuring its root zone remains cool and shaded. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and benefits from regular fertilization during its growing season to support abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate to rich soil; apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or compost in early spring and again in early summer.
