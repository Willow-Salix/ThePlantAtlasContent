## 🌱 Overview
Crassula is a genus of succulent plants containing about 200 accepted species, including the popular jade plant (Crassula ovata). They are members of the stonecrop family (Crassulaceae) and are native to many parts of the globe, but cultivated varieties originate almost exclusively from species from the Eastern Cape of South Africa.
Crassulas are usually propagated by stem or leaf cuttings. Most cultivated forms will tolerate some small degree of frost, but extremes of cold or heat will cause them to lose foliage and die.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in consistently wet or submerged conditions, mimicking its native vernal pool or pond-edge habitats. It prefers full sun to partial shade and requires minimal fertilization, adapting to the temporary and often nutrient-poor nature of its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant naturally grows in ephemeral environments that are not typically rich in nutrients. A very dilute, balanced aquatic fertilizer can be applied sparingly if needed.
