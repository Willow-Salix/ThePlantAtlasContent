## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, characteristic of its native temperate Mediterranean meadows. It requires moderate watering and minimal fertilization due to its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a relatively low-maintenance option.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume (Fabaceae family), it is a nitrogen-fixer and enriches the soil. Requires minimal additional fertilization; an annual application of balanced compost or slow-release fertilizer in poor soils is generally sufficient.
