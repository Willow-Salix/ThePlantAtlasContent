## 🌱 Overview
Cordyline is a genus of about 24 species of woody monocotyledonous flowering plants in family Asparagaceae, subfamily Lomandroideae. The subfamily has previously been treated as a separate family Laxmanniaceae, or Lomandraceae. Other authors have placed the genus in the Agavaceae (now Agavoideae). Cordyline is native to the western Pacific Ocean region, from New Zealand, eastern Australia, southeastern Asia and Polynesia, with one species found in southeastern South America.
The name Cordyline comes from the Greek word kordyle, meaning "club," a reference to the enlarged underground stems or rhizomes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mimicking its tropical rainforest origin, Cordyline guineensis requires high humidity, consistent moisture in the soil, and indirect light. Protect it from direct sun exposure and provide moderate feeding during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season. Use a balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength every 2-4 weeks from spring to early autumn.
