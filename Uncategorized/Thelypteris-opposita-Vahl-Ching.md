## 🌱 Overview
Thelypteris (maiden ferns) is a genus of ferns in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, family Thelypteridaceae, order Polypodiales. Two radically different circumscriptions of the genus are in use as of January 2020. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the genus is a very small one with about two species. In other approaches, the genus is the only one in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, and so includes between 875 and 1083 species.
The genus name is from Greek thēlys "female" and pteris "fern". However, "female fern" usually refers to the common lady-fern.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Oppositeleaf Maiden Fern flourishes in a humid, consistently moist environment with low to medium indirect light. Ensure the soil remains damp but well-drained, and provide high humidity to mimic its tropical rainforest origin. Fertilize sparingly during periods of active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Lightly fertilize with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season. Mimics the nutrient cycling of decomposing organic matter in its natural habitat.
