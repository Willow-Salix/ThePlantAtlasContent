## Care Guide
Thriving in conditions similar to its native temperate woodlands, the American Hogpeanut prefers partial sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. As a legume, it has modest fertilizer needs, benefiting most from organic matter. Ensure regular watering to maintain soil moisture, particularly during dry periods.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. As a legume, it can fix nitrogen. Benefits from rich, organic soil; an annual application of compost or a light, balanced fertilizer in spring is generally sufficient.
