## Care Guide
This annual plant flourishes in full sun to partial shade, requiring moderate watering during its growing phase but tolerating dry spells. It prefers low to moderately fertile soils. Replicate its native Mediterranean and arid scrubland environment for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility. It is adapted to less nutrient-rich soils, so a light, balanced fertilizer is only necessary if soil is extremely poor, or none at all.
