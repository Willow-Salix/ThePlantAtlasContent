## Introduction
The docks and sorrels, genus Rumex, are a genus of about 200 species of annual, biennial, and perennial herbs in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae.
Members of this genus are very common perennial herbs with a native almost worldwide distribution, and introduced species growing in the few places where the genus is not native.
Some are nuisance weeds (and are sometimes called dockweed or dock weed), but some are grown for their edible leaves. Rumex species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species, and are the only host plants of Lycaena dispar and Lycaena rubidus.

## Care Guide
This hardy plant, native to semi-arid to temperate regions of South and Central Asia, thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between applications, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Overall, it is an adaptable and relatively low-maintenance species.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer can be applied during the growing season if desired, but it's not highly demanding.
