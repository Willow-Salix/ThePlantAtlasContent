| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate to Subarctic Coastal Grassland/Dune |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, accustomed to exposed coastal environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, consistent moisture, especially in well-draining sandy or gravelly soils; tolerant of brief dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Seabeach Bluegrass thrives in full sun conditions typical of its native cool temperate to subarctic coastal habitats. It requires moderate, consistent moisture in very well-draining soil, reflecting its natural sandy and gravelly environments. Minimal to no fertilization is necessary, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor coastal soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; adapted to nutrient-poor coastal soils. If desired, a very light, balanced slow-release application in spring.
