## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia, particularly in temperate and boreal regions. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest and Subalpine/Alpine zones, characterized by high humidity, consistent moisture, and often shaded conditions. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers very low, indirect light to deep shade. Direct sunlight will quickly scorch and dry out the plant. |
| **Watering** | Requires constantly moist conditions. The substrate should never be allowed to dry out, but avoid standing water that can lead to rot. High humidity is also beneficial. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Nardia liverworts thrive in cool, highly humid environments with consistent moisture and very low light. Mimic their native forest floor or stream bank habitats by providing deep shade and preventing the substrate from ever drying out. Fertilization is generally unnecessary or should be extremely sparse.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is needed. If used, apply a very dilute liquid fertilizer specifically formulated for mosses or non-vascular plants, very infrequently (e.g., once a year).
