## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern California, USA (specifically, San Bernardino, San Gabriel, and other Transverse and Peninsular Ranges) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane Forest (within a Mediterranean climate zone) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Sun (requires good light exposure typical of high-elevation forest clearings and rocky slopes) |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate (allow soil to dry out between waterings; naturally adapted to dry summers and relies on winter moisture and snowmelt at higher elevations. Drought-tolerant once established.) |

## 🌱 Overview
Packera is a genus of about 75 species of plants in the daisy family, Asteraceae. Most species are commonly called ragworts or grounsels. Its members were previously included in the genus Senecio (where they were called aureoid senecios by Asa Gray), but were moved to genus Packera based on chromosome numbers, a variety of morphological characters, and molecular phylogenetic evidence.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, well-draining conditions characteristic of its native montane pine forest and rocky slope habitats. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and exhibits good drought tolerance once established. Minimal fertilization is typically sufficient.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate (native to rocky, often nutrient-poor slopes; a light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring should suffice, or none if soil is already reasonably fertile)
