| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun for optimal growth and flowering, mimicking its native open desert habitat with intense, direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. Overwatering is detrimental. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun and demands very infrequent watering, being highly drought-tolerant. It prefers lean soil and generally needs little to no supplemental fertilization, making it a low-maintenance, arid-adapted plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor desert soils. If desired, apply a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once annually in spring.
