## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., New Zealand, Australia, Patagonia) and cool temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., Pacific Northwest, parts of Europe). |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forests, Temperate Rainforests, and high-altitude montane forests, characterized by high humidity and frequent rainfall. |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to dappled shade; sensitive to direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is crucial. Requires consistent moisture from air and occasional rainfall/misting, ensuring the thallus remains hydrated but not waterlogged. |

## Introduction
Menegazzia is a genus of lichenized fungi containing roughly 70 accepted species. The group is sometimes referred to as the tree flutes, honeycombed lichens, or hole-punch lichens.  The most obvious morphological feature of the genus is the distinctive perforations spread across the upper side of the thallus. This makes the group easy to recognise, even for those not particularly familiar with lichen identification.
The genus has a sub-cosmopolitan distribution (excluding Antarctica), but is concentrated in Australasia, Melanesia, and southern South America.  Most species grow exclusively on trees, but some grow on rocks, moss, and/or soil.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in cool, highly humid environments with indirect light, mimicking its native temperate rainforest habitat. Ensure consistent moisture through high ambient humidity or frequent misting, and avoid any form of fertilization as it is highly sensitive to excess nutrients.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain nutrients from atmospheric deposition and their substrate, and are sensitive to added nutrients.
