## 🌱 Overview
Rumohra is a genus of ferns in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Elaphoglossoideae, in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I).
The fronds of species within this genus contain round sori (reproductive clusters) on the underside of the pinnae (leaflets) unlike many other ferns which have separate specialized reproductive fronds. Many of the sori have peltate indusia and have prominent scales on the stipes of the fronds. Species have a wide distribution; for example, Rumohra adiantiformis is found in the Old World as well as the New World, including such diverse places as the Galapagos Islands and New Zealand.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fern thrives in conditions mimicking its native forest understory. Provide indirect light, consistently moist well-draining soil, and high humidity. Fertilize sparingly during the active growing season for best results.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring/summer); reduce or cease in winter. Prefers rich, organic soil.
