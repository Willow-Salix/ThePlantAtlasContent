## Introduction
Ornithogalum is a genus  of perennial plants mostly native to southern Europe and southern Africa belonging to the family Asparagaceae. Some species are native to other areas such as the Caucasus. Some species are classified as noxious invasive weeds in some portions of North America. Growing from a bulb, species have linear basal leaves and a slender stalk, up to 30 cm tall, bearing clusters of typically white star-shaped flowers, often striped with green. The common name of the genus, star-of-Bethlehem, is based on its star-shaped flowers, after the Star of Bethlehem that appears in the biblical account of the birth of Jesus. The number of species has varied considerably, depending on authority, from 50 to 300.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright, sunny conditions, mimicking its native South African fynbos environment. Water consistently during its winter-spring growing season, allowing for slight drying between waterings, and keep dry during its summer dormancy. Fertilize minimally to support its natural adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Requires minimal fertilization; use a diluted, balanced fertilizer sparingly during the growing season, as it's adapted to nutrient-poor soils.
