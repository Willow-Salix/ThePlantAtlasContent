## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northeastern North America (e.g., New England, Great Lakes Region, eastern Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Meadow/Rocky Outcrop |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; allow the topsoil to dry between waterings. It is tolerant of some drought once established due to its rocky native environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rand's goldenrod thrives in full sun and well-drained to rocky soils, reflecting its native temperate meadow and outcrop habitats. It requires moderate watering but becomes drought-tolerant once established, and it has low fertilizer needs. This makes it a robust, low-maintenance plant ideal for naturalized areas or rock gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; this plant generally thrives in lean soils. A light application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil is very poor.
