## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
Absaroka Range Beardtongue thrives in full sun and requires exceptionally well-drained, lean soil to mimic its native rocky mountain habitat. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot, and avoid rich fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low, thrives in lean to poor soils; avoid rich fertilizers as they can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
