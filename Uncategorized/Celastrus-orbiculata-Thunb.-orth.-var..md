## Introduction
Celastrus orbiculatus is a woody vine of the family Celastraceae. It is commonly called Oriental bittersweet, as well as Chinese bittersweet, Asian bittersweet, round-leaved bittersweet, and Asiatic bittersweet. 
It is native to China, where it is the most widely distributed Celastrus species, and to Japan and Korea. It was introduced into North America in 1879, and is considered to be an invasive species in eastern North America. It closely resembles the native North American species, Celastrus scandens, with which it will readily hybridize.

## Care Guide
Oriental Bittersweet thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting its temperate East Asian origins. It requires moderate watering and generally minimal fertilization due to its robust and adaptable nature. This plant is known for its vigor and can be invasive.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a vigorous and often invasive vine, it typically does not require heavy fertilization; a light, balanced fertilizer in spring if soil is poor is sufficient.
