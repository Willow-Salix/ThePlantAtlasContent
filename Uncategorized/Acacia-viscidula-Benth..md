## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its arid Australian origins. It requires infrequent deep watering, tolerating significant dry periods, and prefers well-draining soil. Fertilization should be minimal, considering its natural ability to fix nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer sparingly, especially after establishment.
