## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical Asia, including India, Southeast Asia (e.g., Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines), Southern China, Japan (Ryukyu Islands), and parts of Australia and Pacific Islands. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Rainforests and Monsoon Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to dappled sunlight. As an understory plant or liana, it thrives with protection from harsh, direct afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained, mimicking the regular rainfall of its native habitat. Water regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, reducing frequency in cooler, less active periods. |

## Introduction
Morinda is a genus of flowering plants in the madder family, Rubiaceae. The generic name is derived from the Latin words morus "mulberry", from the appearance of the fruits, and indica, meaning "of India".

## Care Guide
This tropical climber thrives in warm, humid conditions with consistent moisture and partial shade. Provide regular watering to maintain moist, well-drained soil, and feed lightly during active growth to support its vigorous habit and robust foliage.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
