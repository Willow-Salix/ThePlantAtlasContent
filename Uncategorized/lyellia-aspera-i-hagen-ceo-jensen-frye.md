# Lyellia Moss
### *Lyellia aspera (I. Hagen & C.E.O. Jensen) Frye*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal regions including North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska, Northern US), Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, UK), and Northern Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Boreal/Montane Bog (acidic peatlands) |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate full sun if kept consistently wet and humid, but direct scorching sun should be avoided in drier conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist to wet substrate, mimicking its native bog environment. High ambient humidity is crucial; never allow to dry out completely. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lyellia moss thrives in consistently wet, acidic conditions with high humidity, typical of temperate bogs. Provide bright indirect to partial sun and avoid rich soils or excessive fertilization. Constant moisture is key for its survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic conditions characteristic of peat bogs. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
