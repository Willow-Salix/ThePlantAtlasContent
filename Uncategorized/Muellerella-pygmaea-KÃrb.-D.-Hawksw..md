## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal and Alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Alps, British Isles), North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Arctic Canada), and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate, Boreal, and Alpine Tundra. Characterized by cool temperatures, regular precipitation (rain, snow, fog), and high humidity, often found on exposed rock faces. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. While it can tolerate exposure on rocks, it benefits from protection against intense, prolonged direct sun during dry periods to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | As a lichen, it absorbs moisture directly from the atmosphere. It thrives with frequent exposure to humidity, fog, or rainfall, followed by periods of drying. No traditional watering is needed; consistent atmospheric moisture is key. |

## Introduction
Muellerella is a genus of lichenicolous lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in northern temperate areas, and contains species that live on other lichens, or on liverworts.
Molecular phylogenetic analysis published in 2019 indicates that the genus, as currently circumscribed, is polyphyletic. M. atricola and M. lichenicola form one monophyletic lineage in the genus, but the rest of the species tested fell into two distinct monophyletic lineages. The authors suggest the placement of the genus within the subclass Chaetothyriomycetidae, but acknowledge that more genetic analysis is required to determine the correct placement of the type species, Muellerella polyspora.

## Care Guide
The Dwarf Muellerella Lichen thrives in cool, humid environments on rock substrates. Provide bright, indirect light to partial sun, ensuring consistent atmospheric moisture through humidity or misting, allowing for drying cycles. Avoid traditional fertilizers, as they can be detrimental to its growth.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable and generally harmful. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from atmospheric dust, precipitation, and minerals leached from their substrate.
