## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Mississippi) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often in open pinelands, dry prairies, or sandy clearings) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers high light exposure reflecting its open habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. While from a humid region, its sandy soil habitat suggests good drainage is key. Water when the topsoil is dry, drought tolerant once established. |

## Introduction
Ruellia is a genus of flowering plants commonly known as ruellias or wild petunias. They are not closely related to petunias (Petunia) although both genera belong to the same euasterid clade. The genus was named in honor of Jean Ruelle (1474–1537), herbalist and physician to Francis I of France and translator of several works of Dioscorides.
Numerous formerly independent genera are nowadays considered synonymous with Ruellia, including Blechum, Eusiphon,  and Ulleria. Acanthopale and Polylychnis are considered a distinct genera.
Ruellias are popular ornamental plants. Some are used as medicinal plants, but many are known or suspected to be poisonous. Their leaves are food for the caterpillars of several Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), typically Nymphalinae and in particular members of their tribe Junoniini, such as the larvae of the banded peacock (Anartia fatima). Nymphalinae using Ruellia as host plants include the common buckeye (Junonia coenia), recorded on R. nodiflora, the lemon pansy (Junonia lemonias), recorded on R. tuberosa, and the malachite butterfly (Siproeta stelenes) and Australian lurcher (Yoma sabina), which are recorded on several species.

## Care Guide
This variety thrives in full sun with well-drained, sandy soil, reflecting its native habitat in the southeastern U.S. Provide moderate watering, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings, and fertilize sparingly as it is adapted to less fertile conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to less fertile sandy soils; a light, balanced fertilizer during the growing season is generally sufficient.
