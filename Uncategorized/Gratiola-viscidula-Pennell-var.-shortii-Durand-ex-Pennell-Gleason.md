## Care Guide
This wetland plant thrives in consistently saturated or standing water and requires full sun exposure to mimic its native boggy environment. Provide a moderately fertile soil rich in organic matter to support healthy growth. Ensure the plant never dries out to maintain its health and vigor, especially during warmer months.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderately fertile soil rich in organic matter. A balanced slow-release aquatic or general-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth is slow, primarily during the growing season.
