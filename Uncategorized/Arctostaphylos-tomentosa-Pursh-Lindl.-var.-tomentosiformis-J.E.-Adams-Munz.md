## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central California Coast Ranges, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sun daily), preferring unshaded exposure. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires infrequent deep watering during its first few years, primarily in fall/winter. Established plants should avoid summer irrigation to prevent disease. |

## Introduction
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## Care Guide
This Manzanita thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for low-water landscapes. It requires minimal watering, primarily during its establishment phase in cooler months, and generally benefits from no fertilization. Avoid summer irrigation to ensure plant health.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Adapted to nutrient-poor soils; fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental to established plants.
