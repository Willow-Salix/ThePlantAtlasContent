## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Americas, including Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America (e.g., Brazil, Bolivia, French Guiana). |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to indirect light; mimic its understory or epiphytic habitat by providing dappled shade. Direct sun will scorch its fronds. |
| **Watering** | Keep the growing medium consistently moist but not waterlogged. Requires very high ambient humidity, making frequent misting or a humidity tray beneficial. |

## Care Guide
The Forked Lineleaf Fern thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest. Provide low to indirect light, maintain consistently moist substrate alongside high humidity, and fertilize lightly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient; a diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., half-strength) can be applied monthly or bi-monthly during its active growing season. Being epiphytic/lithophytic, it's not a heavy feeder.
