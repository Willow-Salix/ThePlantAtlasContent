| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern North America, primarily central and eastern United States and parts of Canada |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is preferred, reflecting its open prairie habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; the plant is accustomed to periods of both rainfall and drought in its native habitat. Water regularly to establish, then it is quite drought-tolerant. |

## Introduction
Helianthus () is a genus comprising around 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the daisy family Asteraceae commonly known as sunflowers. Except for three South American species, the species of Helianthus are native to North America and Central America. The best-known species is the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus). This and other species, notably Jerusalem artichoke (H. tuberosus), are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions, as food crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants. The species H. annuus typically grows during the summer and into early fall, with the peak growth season being mid-summer.
Several perennial Helianthus species are grown in gardens, but have a tendency to spread rapidly and can become aggressive.  On the other hand, the whorled sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus, was listed as an endangered species in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule protecting it under the Endangered Species Act. The primary threats to this species are industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. They grow to 1.8 metres (6 feet) and are primarily found in woodlands, adjacent to creeks and moist, prairie-like areas.
The common sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine, cultivated there for several centuries.

## Care Guide
Sawtooth Sunflower is a resilient plant native to North American prairies, requiring full sun exposure and moderate watering, becoming drought-tolerant once established. It thrives in average soils without significant fertilization, making it a low-maintenance option for sunny landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in average to poor, well-draining soils common in prairies and disturbed areas, and does not require heavy fertilization.
