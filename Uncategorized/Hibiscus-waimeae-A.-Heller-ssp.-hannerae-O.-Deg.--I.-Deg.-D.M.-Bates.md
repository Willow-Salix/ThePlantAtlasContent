## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Kauai, Hawaiian Islands, USA |
| **Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect light to full sun. While it can tolerate full sun, some afternoon shade is beneficial in very hot climates to prevent leaf scorch. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, but not waterlogged, mimicking regular tropical rainfall. Water deeply when the top inch of soil feels dry. |

## Introduction
Hibiscus is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. The genus is quite large, comprising several hundred species that are native to warm temperate, subtropical and tropical regions throughout the world. Member species are renowned for their large, showy flowers and those species are commonly known simply as "hibiscus", or less widely known as rose mallow. The genus includes both annual and perennial herbaceous plants, as well as woody shrubs and small trees.
Several species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants, notably Hibiscus syriacus and Hibiscus × rosa-sinensis.
