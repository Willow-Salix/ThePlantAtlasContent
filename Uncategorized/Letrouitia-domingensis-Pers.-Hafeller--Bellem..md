## Care Guide
This tropical lichen thrives in environments with high humidity and consistent moisture, preferring partial shade to moderate indirect light. It naturally absorbs nutrients from the air and rain, rendering conventional fertilization unnecessary. Mimic its humid, filtered-light forest habitat for optimal growth and health.

### Fertilizer
No conventional fertilizer needed; obtains all necessary nutrients directly from airborne particles, dust, and rainfall.
