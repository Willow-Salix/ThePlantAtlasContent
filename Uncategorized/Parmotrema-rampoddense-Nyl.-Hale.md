## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in high humidity and bright indirect light to partial sun, commonly found on tree bark or rocks in tropical and subtropical zones. It absorbs moisture directly from the air and rainfall, needing regular wetting balanced with drying periods to prevent issues. Fertilization is not necessary and can be detrimental to its health.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens absorb nutrients from the atmosphere and substrate. Traditional fertilizers can be harmful.
