## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (primarily inner North Coast Ranges, Sierra Nevada foothills, and Transverse Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open, exposed locations, often found in chaparral and oak woodlands. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Water during its active growing season in late winter and spring. It is highly drought-tolerant in summer and requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Clarkia is a genus within the flowering plant family Onagraceae.  Over 40 species are currently classified in Clarkia; almost all are native to western North America, though one species (Clarkia tenella) is native to South America.
Clarkias are typically annual herbs, growing either prostrate or erect to a height of less than 2 metres.  Their leaves are small and simple, from 1 to 10 cm in length depending on the species.  Their flowers have four sepals and four petals, usually white, pink, or red, and are often spotted or streaked. Their fruit are elongated, cylindrical pods, usually 4-grooved or 8-grooved, and when mature they hold many tiny, cubical seeds.
Several members of the genus are sometimes referred to by the common name "godetia", including Clarkia amoena, Clarkia affinis, and Clarkia lassenensis (the Lassen godetia).  This is because they were formerly classified in a genus called Godetia, which is no longer recognised since its members have been absorbed into the genus Clarkia.  Older sources may still use Godetia as a genus name.
The genus was named in honour of the explorer Captain William Clark. Unofficially, the genus is sometimes referred to as Yorkia, in honor of York, an African-American member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.
The Royal Navy had a warship called HMS Clarkia, a Flower-class corvette.

## Care Guide
Mountain Clarkia flourishes in conditions mirroring its native Mediterranean climate, demanding full sun and well-drained soil. It needs moderate watering during its spring growing season, becoming very drought-tolerant as it enters summer dormancy. Minimal or no fertilization is necessary for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to lean, well-drained soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer application once at the start of the growing season or no fertilizer is usually sufficient.
