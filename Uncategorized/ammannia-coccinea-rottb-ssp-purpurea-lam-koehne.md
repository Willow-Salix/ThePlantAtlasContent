## 🌱 Overview
Ammannia is a genus of over 100 species of flowering plants often referred to as redstems from wet areas in America, Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe. Several species are grown as decorative plants in aquariums.
The genus was named (but not published) by William Houstoun and later published by Linnaeus, who later indicated that the name honored Paul Amman. However, Philip Miller, who received Houstoun's manuscripts on Houston's death, stated that it honored Johann Amman.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in high light and consistently wet conditions, reminiscent of its native tropical wetland environment. Ensure its soil never dries out and provide regular nutrients to support vigorous growth, potentially even allowing for shallow submersion.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Regular fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season is beneficial due to often rich native wetland soils.
