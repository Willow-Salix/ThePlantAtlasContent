## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Central and South America (including Mexico, Brazil, and parts of the Caribbean) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light. As an understory plant in its native habitat, it thrives without direct harsh sun. Direct sunlight can scorch its leaves, while too little light will result in leggy growth and smaller leaves. |
| **Watering** | Water thoroughly when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry to the touch. In its native rainforest environment, rainfall is frequent, but the soil is well-draining. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot, but do not let the soil dry out completely for extended periods. High humidity is also crucial. |

## Introduction
Philodendron is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. As of September 2025, the Plants of the World Online accepted 625 species; other sources accept different numbers. Regardless of number of species, the genus is the second-largest member of the family Araceae, after genus Anthurium. Taxonomically, the genus Philodendron is still poorly known, with many undescribed species. Many are grown as ornamental and indoor plants. The name derives from the Greek words philo- 'love, affection' and dendron 'tree'. The generic name, Philodendron, is often used as the English name.

## Care Guide
Mimic its tropical rainforest habitat by providing bright, indirect light and consistent soil moisture, allowing the top layer to dry between waterings. High humidity is essential, and regular, diluted feeding during the growing season will support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength, every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during the fall and winter months when growth naturally slows.
