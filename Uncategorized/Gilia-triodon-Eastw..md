## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Mediterranean Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low watering frequency; highly drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking arid conditions with seasonal rainfall. |

## Introduction
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## Care Guide
This California native thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal water once established. It prefers well-draining, nutrient-poor soils, making fertilizer largely unnecessary for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils characteristic of its native scrubland environment.
