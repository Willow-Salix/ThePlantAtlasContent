## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA; Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate / Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low; drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during the dry summer months. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
This buckwheat thrives in conditions mimicking its native sunny, dry Mediterranean climate. Provide full sun and ensure excellent drainage with very infrequent watering once established. It prefers lean soils and requires minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils. Fertilize minimally or not at all, as excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
