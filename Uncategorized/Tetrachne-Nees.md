## Care Guide
This hardy grass, native to the arid grasslands and savannas of Southern Africa, thrives in full sun conditions. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering, and prefers well-draining, moderately fertile soil with minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is needed. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once during the active growing season (spring/summer) is sufficient for optimal health.
