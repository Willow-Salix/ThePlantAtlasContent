## Care Guide
Kayea requires conditions simulating its tropical rainforest origin, meaning consistently moist, well-draining soil and bright, indirect to partial sun. Provide regular fertilization during active growth to support its development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season, given the rich but rapidly cycling nutrients in rainforest soils.
