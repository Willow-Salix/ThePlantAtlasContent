## Introduction
Carlquistia is a rare North American genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae containing the single species Carlquistia muirii. Formerly named Raillardiopsis muirii, the plant was reexamined in the 1990s and moved to a new genus of its own, separate from similar and closely related genera, such as Madia.  Common names for the species include Muir's tarplant, Muir's raillardiopsis, and Muir's raillardella.
This plant is related to the silversword alliance of Hawaiian plants.
The genus was named for the American botanist Sherwin Carlquist (1930–2021). The specific epithet "muirii" honors Scottish-American naturalist, John Muir (1838–1914).

## Care Guide
Carlquist's Tarweed thrives in full sun conditions, mirroring its native California chaparral and grassland habitat. It requires moderate watering during its active growth in cooler months, followed by significantly reduced watering to tolerate hot, dry summers. Minimal fertilizer is needed, as it is adapted to naturally less fertile soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in naturally less fertile soils; excessive fertilization is generally not needed.
