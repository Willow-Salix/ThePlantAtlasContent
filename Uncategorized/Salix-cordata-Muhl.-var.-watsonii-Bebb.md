Salix cordata, the sand dune willow, furry willow, or heartleaf willow, is a perennial shrub that grows 3 to 12 feet (0.91 to 3.66 m) tall; plants taller than 6 feet (1.8 m) are rare.

## Care Guide
Heartleaf Willow thrives in sunny locations with a constant supply of moisture, mirroring its native riparian and wetland environments. It is crucial to maintain consistently wet soil and avoid any dry periods, as this plant is highly intolerant of drought. Moderate fertilization is generally sufficient, with additional feeding only if growth appears to be struggling.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Naturally grows in areas with accumulated organic matter. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied in early spring, especially if the soil is poor or growth is sluggish.
