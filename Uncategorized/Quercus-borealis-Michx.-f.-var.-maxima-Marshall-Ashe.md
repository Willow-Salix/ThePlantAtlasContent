## Introduction
Quercus rubra, the northern red oak or common red oak, is an oak tree in the red oak group (Quercus section Lobatae). It is a native of North America, in the eastern and central United States and southeast and south-central Canada. It has been introduced to small areas in Western Europe, where it can frequently be seen cultivated in gardens and parks. It prefers good soil that is slightly acidic. Often simply called red oak, northern red oak is so named to distinguish it from southern red oak (Q. falcata), also known as the Spanish oak.

## Care Guide
The Northern Red Oak is a robust deciduous tree that thrives in temperate deciduous forests. It requires full sun to partial shade and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil. Once established, it is relatively low-maintenance, requiring minimal fertilization and moderate watering.

### Fertilizer
Low. Established trees in good soil typically do not require regular fertilization. Young or stressed trees in poor soil may benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring.
