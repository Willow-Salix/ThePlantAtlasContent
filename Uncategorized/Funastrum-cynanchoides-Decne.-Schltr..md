| **Native Origin** | Southwestern USA (California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers full sun for best growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly during cooler, dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Funastrum is a genus of flowering plant now in the family Apocynaceae. The name is derived from the Latin word funis, meaning "rope", and astrum, alluding to the twining stems. Members of the genus are commonly known as twinevines.

## Care Guide
To mimic its native arid scrubland environment, Fringed Twinevine requires full sun and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing deep but infrequent watering with the soil completely drying between sessions. Fertilization should be minimal, applied sparingly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; thrives in lean soils. A light application of a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich soil.
