## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native Western US montane grassland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and no regular fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; generally does not require fertilizer. If growth is poor, a light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring may be beneficial.
