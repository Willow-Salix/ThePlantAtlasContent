| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane Temperate to Subalpine Riparian |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sun per day for best growth) |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil, as it naturally occurs along streambanks, wet meadows, and bogs; does not tolerate drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Booth's Willow requires consistently moist to wet soil, preferring full sun to partial sun exposure, reflecting its native habitat in open, wet montane and subalpine areas. It thrives with good soil moisture and benefits from moderate fertility, especially in soils lacking organic matter. Ensure it has a reliable water source and sufficient light to mimic its natural, cool-temperate riparian environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; thrives in soils with good organic matter content, but is not overly demanding. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be beneficial in poor soils.
