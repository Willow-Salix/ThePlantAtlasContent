## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern Brazil, northern Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay |
| **Climate** | Subtropical and warm temperate forests, often as understory or along riverbanks with high humidity. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light is ideal, mimicking its native understory habitat. Can tolerate some morning sun but should be protected from harsh afternoon direct light to prevent leaf scorch. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch, and ensure good drainage. Reduce frequency slightly in winter. |

## Introduction
Tradescantia () is a genus of 85 species of herbaceous perennial wildflowers in the family Commelinaceae, native to the Americas from southern Canada to northern Argentina, including the West Indies. Members of the genus are known by many common names, including inchplant, wandering jew, spiderwort, dayflower and trad.
Tradescantia grow 30–60 cm  tall (1–2 ft), and are commonly found individually or in clumps in wooded areas and open fields. They were introduced into Europe as ornamental plants in the 17th century and are now grown in many parts of the world. Some species have become naturalized in regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and on some oceanic islands.
The genus's many species are of interest to cytogenetics because of evolutionary changes in the structure and number of their chromosomes. They have also been used as bioindicators for the detection of environmental mutagens. Some species have become pests to cultivated crops and considered invasive.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and consistently moist soil, similar to its native subtropical forest understory. Ensure high humidity and regular feeding during the growing season for robust growth, protecting it from direct, harsh sun which can damage foliage.

### Fertilizer
Feed monthly during the active growing seasons of spring and summer with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength. Reduce or cease feeding in fall and winter when growth slows.
