## Introduction
Polycarpaea is a genus of plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It contains 79 species native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, Africa and Madagascar, the Indian subcontinent, Indochina, southern China, Taiwan, the Philippines, New Guinea, and Australia. The genus was named by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1792.
Molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that the genus is polyphyletic and needs to be redefined. It falls into three distinct clades. One of these, a group of species related to P. corymbosa, has acquired the C4 photosynthetic pathway.

## Care Guide
Oldman's Cap thrives in full sun, reflecting its native habitat in open tropical and subtropical grasslands and dry areas. It prefers well-draining soil and is drought-tolerant, requiring moderate to low watering. Fertilization should be minimal, suitable for plants adapted to less fertile environments.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to poor or sandy soils, it does not require heavy fertilization. A balanced, diluted fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season, or none if soil is already adequate.
