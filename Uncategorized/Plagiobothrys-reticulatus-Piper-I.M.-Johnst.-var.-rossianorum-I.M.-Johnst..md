## Introduction
Plagiobothrys is a genus of flowering plants known commonly as popcorn flowers. These are small herbaceous plants which bear tiny white or yellow flowers. Their fruits are nutlets. Although these plants are found predominantly in North America and South America, five species are known from Australia.

## Care Guide
This annual thrives in conditions mimicking its native vernal pool habitat in California. Provide full sun and ensure high moisture during its active growth period in winter and spring. Allow for a distinct dry dormancy phase in summer for successful cultivation and seed production.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native vernal pool soils are not typically high in nutrients; excessive fertilization is generally not needed and may be detrimental.
