# Schofield's Cladonia
### *Cladonia schofieldii Ahti & Brodo*

![Schofield's Cladonia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/CladoniaSpec01.jpg)

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Alaska, British Columbia, Pacific Northwest USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine to Alpine Tundra / Boreal Forest edges |
| **☀️ Light** | Moderate to bright indirect light; avoid intense, prolonged direct summer sun, as it prefers dappled light or open areas with frequent cloud cover typical of its alpine habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Lichens absorb moisture from the air and rain. Maintain high ambient humidity and keep the growing substrate (if applicable, e.g., moss, bark) consistently moist but not waterlogged. Regular misting or placement in a terrarium-like environment with good air circulation is beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations.
Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).
Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.
Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dunes, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.
Larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes continuella, feed on Cladonia species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Schofield's Cladonia thrives in cool, moist, and well-ventilated conditions with moderate to bright indirect light. It requires consistent humidity and moisture without being waterlogged, and absolutely no significant fertilization, as it is highly sensitive to external nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Lichens are sensitive to high nutrient levels and typically require no fertilizer. They derive nutrients from the air and their substrate in naturally nutrient-poor environments. High concentrations can be detrimental.
