| **Sunlight** | Full sun. Requires direct sunlight for most of the day to thrive, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low. As a succulent from arid regions, it is highly drought-tolerant. Water thoroughly only when the soil has completely dried out, then allow it to dry again before the next watering. Reduce watering significantly during dormant periods (winter). |

## Care Guide
This succulent plant, native to the semi-arid scrublands of South Africa, requires ample full sun exposure and very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. Ensure well-draining soil and minimal fertilization to prevent rot and support its natural growth habits.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in lean, well-draining soils. Apply a diluted, balanced fertilizer specifically formulated for succulents sparingly (e.g., once or twice) during its active growing season (spring and summer).
