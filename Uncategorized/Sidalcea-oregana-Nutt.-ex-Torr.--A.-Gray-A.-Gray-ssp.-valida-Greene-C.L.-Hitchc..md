## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Sonoma County, California, USA |
| **Climate** | Temperate Freshwater Marsh / Wet Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers open exposure similar to its native wetland habitats. |
| **Watering** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil, never allowing it to dry out, mimicking its natural marsh environment. |

## Introduction
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## Care Guide
This California native thrives in full sun and demands continuously wet soil, replicating its marsh and wet meadow habitat. Ensure consistent moisture and provide moderate fertility for optimal growth, avoiding dry conditions.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from nutrient-rich, organic soils typical of wetlands but does not require heavy fertilization.
