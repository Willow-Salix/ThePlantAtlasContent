## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Florence Hawthorn thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean climate. Once established, it is notably drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering except during extended dry periods. This hardy plant is low-maintenance regarding fertilizer, making it an excellent choice for temperate gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. An annual application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can support growth, particularly in nutrient-deficient soils.
