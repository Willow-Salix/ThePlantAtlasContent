## Care Guide
This resilient legume thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry slightly between sessions. As a nitrogen-fixing plant, it has very low fertilizer needs. It's a relatively easy-care plant well-suited to warm climates and open areas.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required; as a legume, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil itself.
