| **☀️ Light** | Full sun; requires high light exposure characteristic of treeless alpine environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate and consistent moisture during its short growing season, but absolutely requires extremely well-draining, gritty soil to mimic its rocky native habitat and prevent root rot. Tolerates brief dry spells. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To cultivate Snowbasin Draba, replicate its native alpine environment by providing full sun and exceptionally well-draining, rocky, or gritty soil. Water moderately during the active growing season, ensuring the soil never becomes waterlogged, and avoid heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; alpine soils are typically nutrient-poor, and rich soil can be detrimental to its health.
