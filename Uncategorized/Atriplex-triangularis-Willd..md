## Introduction
Atriplex () is a plant genus of about 250 species, known by the common names of saltbush and orache (; also spelled orach). It belongs to the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae s.l.. 
The genus is quite variable and widely distributed. It includes many desert and seashore plants and halophytes, as well as plants of moist environments. 
The generic name originated in Latin and was applied by Pliny the Elder to the edible oraches. The name saltbush derives from the fact that the plants retain salt in their leaves; they are able to grow in areas affected by soil salination.

## Care Guide
This adaptable halophyte thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, often tolerating challenging coastal or saline conditions. It requires minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in nutrient-poor or saline soils and does not require heavy fertilization.
