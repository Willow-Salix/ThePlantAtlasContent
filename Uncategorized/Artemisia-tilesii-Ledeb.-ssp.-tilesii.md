# Tilesius' Wormwood

*Artemisia tilesii Ledeb. ssp. tilesii* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions, specifically Alaska, Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories, British Columbia to Quebec), Siberia (Russia), and parts of Greenland. |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest, Subarctic, and Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it naturally grows in open, exposed environments like river flats, slopes, and disturbed areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry completely between waterings. Excellent drainage is crucial, as it is highly intolerant of waterlogged conditions, which can lead to root rot. |

## Care Guide
Tilesius' Wormwood thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil, mimicking its native open and often rocky environments. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and keep fertilization to a minimum. Good air circulation and preventing waterlogging are essential for its health.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to lean, gravelly soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer application once in spring may be beneficial, but often none is needed in average garden soil.
