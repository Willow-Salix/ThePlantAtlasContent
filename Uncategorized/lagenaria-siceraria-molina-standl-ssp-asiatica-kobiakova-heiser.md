## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South and Southeast Asia, particularly regions like India and China |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Monsoon Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6-8+ hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and fruit production, reflecting its open-field cultivation in native regions. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent and abundant watering, especially during periods of active growth and fruit development, mimicking the heavy rainfall of its native monsoon climate. Requires well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Calabash (; Lagenaria siceraria), also known as bottle gourd, white-flowered gourd, long melon, birdhouse gourd, New Guinea bean, New Guinea butter bean, Tasmania bean, zucca melon and opo squash, is a vine which is grown for its fruit. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, is native to tropical Africa, and cultivated across the tropics. It can be either harvested young to be consumed as a vegetable, or harvested mature to be dried and used as a kitchen utensil (typically as a ladle or bowl), beverage container or a musical instrument. When it is fresh, the fruit has a light green smooth skin and white flesh.
Calabash fruits have a variety of shapes: they can be huge and rounded, small and bottle-shaped, or slim and serpentine, and they can grow to be over a metre long. Rounder varieties are typically called calabash gourds (L. s. var. depressa) . Calabash gourds can grow to great size. One grown in Taylorsvlle, Kentucky  in 2001 weighed 111.5 kg (246 lb). The gourd was one of the world's first cultivated plants grown not primarily for food, but for use as containers. The bottle gourd may have been carried from Asia to Africa, Europe, and the Americas in the course of human migration, or by seeds floating across the oceans inside the gourd. It has been proven to have been globally domesticated (and existed in the New World) during the Pre-Columbian era.
There is sometimes confusion when discussing "calabash" because the name is shared with the unrelated calabash tree (Crescentia cujete), whose hard, hollow fruits are also used to make utensils, containers, and musical instruments.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This warm-climate vining plant thrives in full sun and rich, well-draining soil. It requires consistent, ample watering and regular fertilization to support its rapid growth and prolific fruit set, especially during warm, humid conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Heavy feeder; requires nutrient-rich, fertile soil and regular application of a balanced or fruiting fertilizer throughout its growing season to support rapid vine growth and large fruit production.
