## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern Australia (New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania), particularly alpine and subalpine regions. |
| **Climate** | Alpine/Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in open, exposed high-altitude environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate, consistent moisture, especially when young. Once established, it is relatively drought-tolerant but benefits from occasional deep watering during dry spells. Tolerant of snowmelt. |

## Introduction
Eucalyptus pauciflora, commonly known as snow gum, cabbage gum or white sally, is a species of tree or mallee that is native to eastern Australia. It has smooth bark, lance-shaped to elliptical leaves, flower buds in clusters of between seven and fifteen, white flowers and cup-shaped, conical or hemispherical fruit. It is widespread and locally common in woodland in cold sites above 700 m (2,300 ft) altitude.

## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun and cool conditions, the Snow Gum requires well-drained soil and moderate, consistent watering, becoming more drought-tolerant once established. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor native soils, fertilization should be minimal and low in phosphorus.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. These plants are adapted to nutrient-poor soils. If necessary, use a low-phosphorus fertilizer sparingly.
