*Bartramia oederi Brid.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal, found across Europe, Asia, and North America, typically in mountainous and subalpine regions. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal/Alpine, often in moist, shaded microclimates such as damp rocks, cliffs, or soil banks. |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; it thrives in shaded or partially shaded environments and should be protected from direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | The substrate should be kept consistently moist but not waterlogged, mimicking its natural habitat on damp rocks and soil. High ambient humidity is beneficial. |

## Care Guide
Oeder's Apple Moss requires a cool, consistently moist, and shaded environment with good air circulation and drainage. Emphasize high humidity and provide minimal to no supplemental nutrients to replicate its natural mountainous habitat.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer is required, as mosses are adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
