## Introduction
Clematis is a genus of about 380 species within the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae.

More cultivars are being produced constantly,  mainly of Chinese and Japanese origin.

## Care Guide
Pine Hyacinth thrives in conditions mimicking its native Florida pine flatwoods, requiring full sun and well-drained, sandy soil. Provide consistent moisture, particularly during dry spells, but allow soil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. This plant generally has low fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs; light fertilization in spring is sufficient, especially in naturally poor soils.
