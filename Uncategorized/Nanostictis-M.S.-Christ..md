# Nanostictis M.S. Christ.

*Nanostictis M.S. Christ.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Humid temperate and boreal forests across the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate and Boreal Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Low to partial light, mimicking the understory of a dense forest canopy. Avoid direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and regular moisture from the environment (rain, dew, mist). Requires consistent moisture; avoid prolonged periods of dryness. |

## Introduction
Nanostictis is a genus of lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) fungi in the family Stictidaceae. These tiny fungi produce minute fruiting bodies that remain embedded within their host lichens and are characterised by very slender, thread-like ascospores divided by multiple cross-walls. The genus contains nine species that parasitise various lichen hosts, though its relationship to similar genera remains uncertain due to the lack of molecular studies on any Nanostictis species.

## Care Guide
Nanostictis, a lichen, thrives in consistently high humidity and low to partial light, typical of forest understories. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from its environment and substrate, requiring no traditional watering or fertilizers. Protection from direct sunlight and sustained humidity are key for its survival.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no traditional fertilizer. Nutrients are absorbed from atmospheric deposition (e.g., dust, rain) and its substrate (e.g., decaying wood, bark).
