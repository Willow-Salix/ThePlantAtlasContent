## Care Guide
This rush thrives in consistently wet conditions, ideally in full sun to partial shade, mirroring its natural habitat in Northeastern U.S. wetlands. It prefers poor to moderately fertile, acidic soils and must never be allowed to dry out. Minimal fertilization is typically sufficient.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilization needs, as it naturally grows in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile, often sandy or peaty soils.
