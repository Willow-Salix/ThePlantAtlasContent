| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia (New South Wales, Queensland) |
| **Climate** | Warm Temperate to Subtropical Heathland and Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring full sun for best flowering. |
| **Watering** | High; thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, replicating its native boggy or swampy habitat. Do not allow to dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Melaleuca () is a genus of nearly 300 species of plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, commonly known as paperbarks, honey-myrtles, bottlebrushes or tea-trees (although the last name is also applied to species of Leptospermum). They range in size from small shrubs that rarely grow to more than 16 m (52 ft) high, to trees up to 35 m (115 ft). Their flowers generally occur in groups, forming a "head" or "spike" resembling a brush used for cleaning bottles, containing up to 80 individual flowers.
Melaleucas are an important food source for nectarivorous insects, birds, and mammals. Many are popular garden plants, either for their attractive flowers or as dense screens and a few have economic value for producing fencing and oils such as "tea tree" oil. Most melaleucas are endemic to Australia, with a few also occurring in Malesia. Seven are endemic to New Caledonia, and one is found only on Australia's Lord Howe Island. 
Melaleucas are found in a wide variety of habitats. Many are adapted for life in swamps and boggy places, while others thrive in the poorest of sandy soils or on the edge of saltpans. Some have a wide distribution and are common, whilst others are rare and endangered. Land clearing, exotic myrtle rust, and especially draining and clearing of swamps threaten many species.

## Care Guide
This Australian native requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, thriving in environments that mimic its natural boggy heathland habitat. It prefers full sun to partial shade. Fertilize sparingly with a low-phosphorus formulation to avoid nutrient burn.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer specifically for Australian natives, or fertilize sparingly.
