## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Texas, New Mexico) and Northern Mexico (Chihuahuan Desert region) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to very bright light. Requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal health and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant. Water thoroughly only when the soil has completely dried out, typically once every 2-4 weeks during the growing season. Reduce watering significantly or cease entirely during winter dormancy. |

## Introduction
Mammillaria is one of the largest genera in the cactus family (Cactaceae), with currently 200 known species and varieties recognized. Most of the mammillarias are native to Mexico, while some come from the Southwestern United States, the Caribbean, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras and Venezuela. The common name "pincushion cactus" refers to this genus and the closely related Escobaria.
The first species was described by Carl Linnaeus as Cactus mammillaris in 1753, deriving its name from the Latin mammilla, "nipple", referring to the tubercles that are among the distinctive features of the genus. Numerous species are commonly known as globe cactus, nipple cactus, birthday cake cactus, fishhook cactus or pincushion cactus (though such terms are also commonly used for related taxa, such as Escobaria or Ferocactus).

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives on abundant sunlight and infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to completely dry out between waterings to prevent rot. It requires minimal fertilization, primarily during its active growing phase, and demands well-draining soil to mimic its arid native environment.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Apply a balanced, diluted cactus/succulent fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer), avoiding fertilization during dormancy.
