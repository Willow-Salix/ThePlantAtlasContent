## Care Guide
This moss requires consistently moist, humid conditions and low to partial light, emulating its native forest floor environment. Maintain dampness without waterlogging the substrate, and avoid direct sun. Fertilization is generally not needed and can be harmful.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses typically do not require supplemental fertilization, as they obtain necessary nutrients from their environment.
