## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Baja California Peninsula, Mexico (and occasionally extreme southern California, USA) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral/Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant once established; requires infrequent to no supplemental water during dry seasons. Sensitive to summer irrigation and poorly drained soils, which can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## Care Guide
Peninsular Manzanita thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean chaparral habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal to no supplemental water, especially during warm seasons, and very little fertilizer. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needs; adapted to lean, rocky, well-drained soils. Can be sensitive to high phosphorus levels.
