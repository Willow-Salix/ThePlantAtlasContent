## 🌱 Overview
Lepidium is a genus of plants in the mustard/cabbage family, Brassicaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. It includes familiar species such as garden cress, maca, and dittander. General common names include peppercress, peppergrass, pepperweed, and pepperwort.  Some species form tumbleweeds.
The genus name Lepidium is from Greek meaning 'small scale', which is thought to be derived from a folk medicine usage of the plant to treat leprosy, which cause small scales on the skin. Another meaning is related to the small scale-like fruit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mountain Pepperweed thrives in conditions mimicking its arid montane scrubland origin, requiring full sun and very little water once established. It is highly drought-tolerant and prefers lean, well-draining soils, making it a low-maintenance plant suited for xeriscaping.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in poor, rocky soils typical of its native habitat and can be sensitive to over-fertilization.
