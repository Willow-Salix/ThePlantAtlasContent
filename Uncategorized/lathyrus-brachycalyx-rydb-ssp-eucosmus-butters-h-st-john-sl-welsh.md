## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern Utah, Southern Idaho, Western Wyoming (USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane Shrubland/Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, needing at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, consistent with its open grassland and woodland understory habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings. It is accustomed to well-drained soils and can tolerate some drought once established, but avoids consistently wet conditions. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This montane peavine thrives in sunny, well-drained locations with moderate watering, mimicking its native temperate shrubland and grassland environment. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires low to moderate fertilization. Ensure good air circulation and avoid waterlogged conditions for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, especially given its legume nature (nitrogen-fixing). A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in poor soils, but heavy feeding is generally not required.
