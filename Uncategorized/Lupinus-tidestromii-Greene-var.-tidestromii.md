## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Tidestrom's Lupine thrives in full sun with exceptionally well-draining, sandy soil, reflecting its native coastal dune environment. Water infrequently once established, as it is highly drought-tolerant, and avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers due to its natural nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed due to its nitrogen-fixing ability as a legume. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers, which can be detrimental.
