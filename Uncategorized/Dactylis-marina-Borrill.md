## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions of temperate Eurasia and North Africa (inferred from genus 'Dactylis' and epithet 'marina') |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coastal Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open, exposed coastal habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate, consistent moisture, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. It is likely adapted to periodic coastal rainfall patterns and may tolerate short dry spells. |

## Care Guide
This temperate coastal grass thrives in full sun with moderate, consistent moisture, adapting to the exposed conditions of its native habitat. It prefers well-drained soils and typically requires low to moderate fertilization to support healthy growth, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, mainly during active growth. Coastal soils can vary, but this grass is likely adapted to less nutrient-rich environments and does not require heavy feeding.
