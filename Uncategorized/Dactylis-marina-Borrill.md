## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate coastal grass thrives in full sun with moderate, consistent moisture, adapting to the exposed conditions of its native habitat. It prefers well-drained soils and typically requires low to moderate fertilization to support healthy growth, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
