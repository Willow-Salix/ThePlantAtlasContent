## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in temperate coastal environments, preferring exposed locations with full to partial sun exposure. It needs consistently high humidity and periodic moisture from rain or sea spray. As it grows on nutrient-poor rocks, no fertilization is necessary, and conventional fertilizers may be harmful.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from the air and precipitation, and traditional fertilizers designed for vascular plants can be detrimental.
