## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern Arizona (USA) and Northern Sonora (Mexico), specifically the Huachuca Mountains and surrounding Madrean Sky Islands. |
| **Climate** | Montane Semi-Arid Woodland and Scrubland. Characterized by high elevation, distinct dry seasons, and summer monsoonal rains. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating the intense light of exposed mountain slopes. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; allow soil to dry out between waterings. Requires more frequent watering during periods of active growth (e.g., summer monsoon season) and can tolerate drier conditions otherwise. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright conditions with well-draining soil, mimicking its semi-arid mountain origin. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and provide minimal fertilization to support its natural growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; prefers well-draining soil. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied annually in spring, or enrich soil with compost.
