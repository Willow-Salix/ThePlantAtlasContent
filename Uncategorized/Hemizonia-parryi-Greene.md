## Care Guide
This plant requires full sun and excellent drainage, mimicking its native dry, open habitats. Water sparingly once established, especially during summer dormancy, and avoid excessive fertilization. It's well-suited for xeriscape or native plant gardens in appropriate climates.

### Fertilizer
