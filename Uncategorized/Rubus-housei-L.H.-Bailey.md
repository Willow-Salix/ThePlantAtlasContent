## Introduction
Rubus is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, subfamily Rosoideae, most commonly known as brambles. Fruits of various species are known as raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, and bristleberries. It is a diverse genus, with the estimated number of Rubus species varying from 250 to over 1000, found across all continents except Antarctica.
Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles like roses; spines, bristles, and gland-tipped hairs are also common in the genus. The Rubus fruit, sometimes called a bramble fruit, is an aggregate of drupelets. The term cane fruit or cane berry applies to any Rubus species or hybrid which is commonly grown with supports such as wires or canes, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry. The stems of such plants are also referred to as canes.

## Care Guide
House's Blackberry, a plant native to temperate Eastern North America, thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistent, moderate soil moisture. It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and benefits from an annual spring feeding. Mimicking its natural forest edge habitat, provide ample light and avoid overly wet conditions for optimal growth and fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from an annual application of balanced general-purpose fertilizer or compost in early spring, particularly in less fertile soils.
