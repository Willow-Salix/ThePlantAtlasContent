## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Salt Sedge thrives in consistently wet to saturated soil, mimicking its native wetland habitat. It performs best in full sun to partial shade and requires only low to moderate fertilization, adapting well to a range of soil types, including those that are alkaline or mildly saline.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization is sufficient, mainly during the growing season. Tolerant of nutrient-poor to moderately rich, often alkaline or slightly saline, soils.
