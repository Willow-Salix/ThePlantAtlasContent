## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native semi-arid prairies: full sun and well-drained, lean soil. It is very drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and generally needs minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in lean soils and generally does not require fertilization. If growth is very weak, a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year.
