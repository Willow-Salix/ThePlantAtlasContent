# Gastony's Cliffbrake

*Pellaea gastonyi Windham* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid to semi-arid mountainous scrubland, often found in limestone rock crevices or outcrops at elevations of 1000–2500 meters. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial to full sun, especially morning sun or filtered light. Can tolerate exposed sites but may appreciate some afternoon shade in very hot climates to prevent scorching. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering is detrimental and can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Gastony's Cliffbrake thrives in conditions mimicking its arid, rocky native habitat. Provide bright light, excellent drainage, and allow the soil to dry out completely between sparse waterings. This fern requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very diluted (1/4 to 1/2 strength) balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer).
