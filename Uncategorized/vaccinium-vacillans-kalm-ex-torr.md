## 🌱 Overview
Vaccinium  vack-SIN-ee-əm is a common and widespread genus of shrubs or dwarf shrubs in the heath family (Ericaceae).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Dryland Blueberry thrives in well-drained, acidic soil under full sun to partial shade conditions. It is notably drought-tolerant once mature, requiring infrequent watering that allows the soil to dry out between sessions. Avoid over-fertilization, opting for minimal application of an acid-specific formula only if necessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; use an acidic fertilizer sparingly, if at all, specifically formulated for acid-loving plants.
