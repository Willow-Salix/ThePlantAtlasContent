## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Europe, primarily the Apennine Mountains of Italy |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Foothills |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun, needing at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. Tolerates partial shade but may have sparser blooms and less compact growth. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot, especially in poorly drained soils. |

## Introduction
Cerastium is a genus of annual, winter annual, or perennial flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. They are commonly called mouse-ears or mouse-ear chickweeds. There are 214 accepted species, found nearly worldwide but with the greatest concentration in the northern temperate regions. A number of the species are common weeds in fields and on disturbed ground.

Cerastium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora chalcogrammella (which feeds exclusively on Cerastium arvense) and Coleophora striatipennella (which has been recorded on Cerastium fontanum).

## Care Guide
This resilient groundcover flourishes in full sun and well-drained conditions, mirroring its native rocky, montane environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, along with very little fertilizer to maintain its health and prolific white blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. It prefers lean to moderately fertile soil and does not require regular feeding. Excessive fertilizer can encourage leggy growth over flowering.
