## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mojave Desert region of California and Nevada, USA |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Tolerates intense heat and direct exposure. |
| **Watering** | Very low, drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings. Overwatering, especially in cooler months, is detrimental. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
Welsh's buckwheat is a desert-adapted plant thriving in conditions mimicking its native Mojave Desert habitat. It requires full, intense sun, very infrequent watering, and extremely well-draining, lean soil. Ensure adequate air circulation and avoid any excess moisture or rich fertilizers to prevent root rot and promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, well-draining soils. Minimal to no fertilizer is required; if desired, a very dilute, balanced formula can be applied once in early spring.
