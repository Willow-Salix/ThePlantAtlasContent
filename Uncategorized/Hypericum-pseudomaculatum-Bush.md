## Introduction
Hypericum  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Hypericaceae (formerly considered a subfamily of Clusiaceae).  The genus has a nearly worldwide distribution, missing only from tropical lowlands, deserts and polar regions. Many Hypericum species are regarded as invasive species and noxious weeds.  All members of the genus may be referred to as St. John's wort, and some are known as goatweed. The white or pink flowered marsh St. John's worts of North America and eastern Asia are generally accepted as belonging to the separate genus Triadenum Raf.
Hypericum is unusual for a genus of its size because a worldwide taxonomic monograph was produced for it by Norman Robson (working at the Natural History Museum, London). Robson recognizes 36 sections within Hypericum.

## Care Guide
Thriving in the warm temperate to humid subtropical climate of the Southeastern U.S., this plant prefers full sun to partial shade. It requires consistent moisture, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and adapts well to average soil fertility with minimal need for additional fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not a heavy feeder. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil is poor, but often unnecessary in average garden soil.
