## Introduction
Myosotis ( MY-ə-SOH-tiss) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae.  In the Northern Hemisphere, they are colloquially known as forget-me-nots or scorpion grasses. Myosotis alpestris is the official flower of Alaska and Dalsland, Sweden.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek μυοσωτίς "mouse's ear", which the foliage is thought to resemble. Plants of the genus are not to be confused with the related genus Myosotidium and its sole species Myosotidium hortensia found in the  Chatham Islands.
