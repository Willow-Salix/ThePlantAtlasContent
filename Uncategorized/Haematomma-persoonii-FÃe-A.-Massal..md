## Introduction
Haematomma is a genus of crustose lichens established by Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo in 1852. It is the sole genus in the Haematommataceae, a family circumscribed by Josef Hafellner in 1984. Commonly called bloodstain lichens, the species assigned to this genus are widely distributed in tropical and temperate areas.
The genus name Haematomma means "bloody eye", a reference to the color of the lichen's apothecia.

## Care Guide
Haematomma persoonii is a lichen adapted to the humid, shaded environments of tropical and subtropical forests. It thrives with high ambient moisture and indirect light, absorbing water and minimal nutrients directly from the atmosphere. Avoid strong direct sunlight and the use of concentrated fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
Extremely minimal; primarily obtains nutrients from airborne particles and rainfall. High concentrations of fertilizer are detrimental.
