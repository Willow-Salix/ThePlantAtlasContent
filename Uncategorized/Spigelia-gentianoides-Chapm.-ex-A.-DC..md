## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Florida, USA (Southeastern United States) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (specifically pine flatwoods and sandy scrub ecosystems) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to full sun, preferring some afternoon shade in warmer regions to prevent leaf scorch, reflecting its habitat in open woodlands and scrub. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained. Water regularly, especially during dry periods, avoiding waterlogging, as typical of humid flatwoods environments. |

## Introduction
Spigelia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Loganiaceae. It contains around 60 species, distributed over the warmer parts of the Americas, from the latitude of Buenos Aires to the Southern United States. It was named after Adriaan van den Spiegel (Adrianus Spigelius) by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum; the type species is Spigelia anthelmia. Pinkroot is a common name for plants in this genus.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright, indirect light to partial sun, with protection from intense afternoon sun. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and benefits from regular watering, mimicking its humid subtropical native habitat. Fertilization should be minimal, supporting its adaptation to naturally occurring soil nutrient levels.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season is sufficient, particularly in poorer sandy soils.
