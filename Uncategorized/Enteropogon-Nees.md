## Care Guide
Umbrellagrass is a resilient plant adapted to full sun and well-draining soils, reflecting its native savanna environment. It thrives with moderate watering during its growing season but tolerates significant dry periods. Minimal fertilization is required due to its adaptation to less nutrient-rich conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring is usually sufficient, or none if soil is naturally fertile.
