## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Woodland/Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its native habitat in open pinelands and sandy fields. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is tolerant of some drought once established, mimicking periods in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Tephrosia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is widespread in both the Eastern and Western Hemisphere, where it is found in tropical and warm-temperate regions.
The generic name is derived from the Greek word τεφρος (tephros), meaning "ash-colored," referring to the greyish tint given to the leaves by their dense trichomes. Hoarypea is a common name for plants in this genus, along with goat's rue and devil's shoestring.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils, characteristic of its native subtropical woodlands. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between sessions, and avoid heavy fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen and thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. If desired, a very light, balanced fertilizer (low in nitrogen) can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
