## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid bluebell thrives in temperate conditions, preferring partial shade but adaptable to full sun in cooler regions. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil during its spring growth period and benefits from light feeding. Allow the plant to go dormant and dry out somewhat in summer.
