| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (cool, moist understory) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade; thrives in dappled light or indirect exposure, avoiding harsh direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking its native habitat along streambanks and in damp woods. Water frequently to prevent the soil from drying out, but ensure good drainage to avoid waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
Curled Starwort thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, emulating its temperate forest understory origins. Maintain consistently damp soil and provide protection from direct, intense sunlight to ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer or well-rotted compost can be applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season, as it thrives in naturally rich forest soils.
