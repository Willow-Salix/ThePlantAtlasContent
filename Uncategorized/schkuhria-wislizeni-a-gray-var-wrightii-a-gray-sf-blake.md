## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions. It needs minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor, arid scrubland environments, making it a low-maintenance choice for hot, dry climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilizer needs; adapted to nutrient-poor soils. A light application of balanced fertilizer once a year during the growing season is sufficient, or none at all if soil is moderately fertile.
