## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Humid Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade, mimicking its natural habitat on tree bark under a forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity and consistent moisture from the air and occasional misting; it absorbs water directly from the environment rather than through roots. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in humid, temperate conditions with bright indirect light or partial shade. It requires high ambient humidity and consistent moisture from the air, preferably through regular misting. No traditional watering or fertilizer is needed, as it absorbs nutrients atmospherically.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate.
