## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Rocky Mountains of North America (specifically Wyoming, Montana, Idaho) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires high light intensity and exposure typical of high-altitude open environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; keep consistently moist during spring and early summer (mimicking snowmelt) in very well-draining soil. Allow soil to dry slightly between waterings during hotter, drier periods. |

## Introduction
Draba is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, commonly known as whitlow-grasses (though they are not related to the true grasses).

## Care Guide
Yellowstone Draba thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean, rocky soil, mirroring its native alpine habitat. Provide consistent moisture during its spring growth phase, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings later in the season. Minimal to no fertilization is required for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean, poor, rocky soils. Heavy fertilization should be avoided as it can harm this alpine species.
