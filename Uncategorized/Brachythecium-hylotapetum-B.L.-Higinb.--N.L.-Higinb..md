## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and highly humid environments characteristic of a temperate forest floor. Provide ample shade and ensure the substrate never dries out to mimic its natural habitat.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. Mosses have minimal nutrient demands, absorbing what they need from water and air. If desired, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly.
