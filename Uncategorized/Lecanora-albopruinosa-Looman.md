| **Native Origin** | Arid and semi-arid regions across western North America, including parts of the USA (e.g., California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah), Mexico, and Canada. |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland and Desert |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure, tolerant of direct sunlight. Often found on exposed rocks or tree bark in open environments. |

## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
This saxicolous/corticolous lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions typical of arid and semi-arid environments. It requires very infrequent moisture, relying on natural precipitation and tolerating long dry spells, with periods of complete dryness being crucial. No external fertilization is needed as it naturally acquires nutrients from air, rain, and its substrate.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable for cultivation; obtains all necessary nutrients from air, rain, and its substrate. Fertilization is not recommended.
