## Care Guide
Long's Bulrush thrives in full sun and demands constantly saturated soil or standing water to replicate its native temperate wetland conditions. It prefers nutrient-poor environments, making minimal or no fertilization necessary. The primary focus for its care should be maintaining perpetual moisture and providing ample light.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; it naturally grows in nutrient-poor, often acidic, wetland soils and requires minimal to no supplemental fertilization.
