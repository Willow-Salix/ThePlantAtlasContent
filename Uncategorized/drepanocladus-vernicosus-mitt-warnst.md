## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wetland moss thrives in constantly wet, high-humidity environments, typical of its cool-temperate to boreal fen habitat. Provide bright indirect light and ensure the substrate remains saturated, avoiding any drying out, with minimal to no fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Fens are generally nutrient-poor environments for bryophytes; excessive fertilization can harm the moss or encourage competing growth.
