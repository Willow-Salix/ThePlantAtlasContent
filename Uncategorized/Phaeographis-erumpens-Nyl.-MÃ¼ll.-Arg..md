## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in environments with high humidity and low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native tropical forest habitat. Regular misting is crucial for moisture absorption, and traditional fertilizers should be avoided as they can cause harm.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain nutrients from airborne particles and rainwater; excess nutrients can be detrimental.
