## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering, preferring periods of dryness between water applications. It adapts well to average soil conditions and generally does not need heavy fertilization, reflecting its robust nature in native tropical and subtropical open habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a plant often found in disturbed areas and fields, it can thrive in average to poor soils. A light application of a balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, or it may not require regular feeding in reasonably fertile soil.
