## Introduction
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).

## Care Guide
Rigid Whitetop Aster is a resilient plant from temperate woodlands and open areas of the Eastern and Central U.S., thriving in full sun to partial shade. It prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil and typically requires minimal fertilization. This makes it a low-maintenance choice adaptable to various garden conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally sufficient in average garden soil. Over-fertilization is usually unnecessary and can promote leggy growth.
