# Wideleaf Stegonia Moss

*Stegonia latifolia (Schwägr.) Vent. ex Broth.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including alpine and subalpine areas of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Rocky Mountains), Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Alps), and Asia (e.g., Siberia). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Boreal Forest (cool temperate to cold, often moist, high-altitude or high-latitude), specifically found in cool, moist, shaded, calcareous rock crevices. |
| **Sunlight** | Low to partial light. Thrives in shaded or semi-shaded conditions, avoiding direct and harsh sunlight which can cause dehydration. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistent moisture and high humidity. The substrate should be kept damp but not waterlogged, ideally through regular misting or placement in a humid environment. |

## Care Guide
This alpine moss requires a cool, consistently moist environment with low to partial light. Maintain high humidity and keep the substrate damp but not waterlogged, and avoid over-fertilizing as it has very low nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Very low. This moss thrives on nutrient-poor substrates like calcareous rocks and requires minimal or no fertilizer. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
