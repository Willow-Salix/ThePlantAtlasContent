## 🌱 Overview
Chaenorhinum is a genus of flowering plants. It includes 27 species of annual and perennial herbs native to the Mediterranean Basin, Europe, and western Asia to the western Himalayas. They thrive in dry stony areas and scree. They are closely related to snapdragons. The leaves are linear to oblong or rounded, opposite at the base. The flowers resemble snapdragons, being typically zygomorphic, hooded, lobed and spurred. They are borne in terminal racemes or singly in the leaf axils of the branching stems.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Mediterranean native thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage to mimic its natural rocky habitats. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, as it is highly drought tolerant once established. Fertilization needs are minimal, as it is adapted to leaner soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. Excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
