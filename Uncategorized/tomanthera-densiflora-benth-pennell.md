### *Tomanthera densiflora (Benth.) Pennell*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, North Carolina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Warm Temperate Wetlands and Pine Savannas |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, bright locations. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native boggy or damp environments. Requires frequent watering to prevent drying out. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, consistently moist to wet conditions, typical of its native southeastern U.S. wetlands and savannas. Provide full to partial sun exposure and ensure the soil remains very damp, avoiding any dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Native habitats are often nutrient-poor. If necessary, use a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly, or amend with organic matter.
