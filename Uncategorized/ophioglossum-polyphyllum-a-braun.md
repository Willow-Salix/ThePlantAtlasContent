## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across Southern Africa (e.g., Namibia, South Africa), North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, parts of Asia (e.g., India, Pakistan), and Australia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Temperate Arid or Semi-Arid regions, often in seasonally wet sandy flats, grasslands, or rocky outcrops with distinct wet and dry seasons. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to bright indirect light, especially during its active growing season when it emerges after rainfall in open habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Water thoroughly and consistently during its active growth phase (mimicking a rainy season), allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. During its dormant period, significantly reduce or cease watering entirely to prevent rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ophioglossum, the adder's-tongue ferns, is a genus of about 50 species of ferns in the family Ophioglossaceae. The genus name comes from Ancient Greek ὄφις (óphis), meaning "snake", and γλῶσσα (glôssa), meaning "tongue". Their cosmopolitan distribution is mainly in tropical and subtropical habitats.
The genus has the largest number of chromosomes in the known plant kingdom, but contrary to popular belief does not have the largest number of chromosomes out of all known organisms, falling short to the protist Sterkiella histriomuscorum.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fern thrives in conditions mimicking its arid to semi-arid native habitat, requiring full sun and consistent moisture during its active growth period. It is crucial to allow a dry, dormant phase and ensure excellent soil drainage to prevent rot, with minimal to no fertilizer needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. If used, apply a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (once or twice) during the active growing season, as it naturally grows in lean soils.
