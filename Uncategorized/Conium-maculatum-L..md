## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia |
| **Climate** | Temperate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade is ideal, meaning it can tolerate direct sunlight for several hours a day but also thrives with some afternoon shade. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist, but not waterlogged, soil. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out slightly between waterings, mimicking natural rainfall in temperate zones. |

## Introduction
Conium maculatum, commonly known as hemlock (British English) or poison hemlock (in North America), is a highly poisonous flowering plant in the carrot family Apiaceae.
The plant is herbaceous, with no woody parts, and has a biennial lifecycle. Under the right conditions, the plant grows quite rapidly during the growing season and can reach heights of 2.4 metres (8 feet) with a long penetrating root. The plant has a distinctive odour that is usually considered unpleasant and carries with the wind. The hollow stems are usually spotted dark maroon and turn dry and brown after the plant completes its biennial lifecycle.
Native to Europe and North Africa, hemlock is a hardy plant that can live in a variety of environments. It is widely naturalised outside its native range, including in Australia, West Asia, and North and South America, where it can become an invasive weed.
All parts of the plant are toxic, particularly the seeds and roots, and especially when ingested. Hemlock is well-known as the poison that killed the philosopher Socrates after his trial in Ancient Greece.

## Care Guide
Poison Hemlock thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is a robust plant with low nutrient requirements, adapting well to various soil types in temperate climates. Ensure adequate moisture without waterlogging, especially during dry periods.

### Fertilizer
Generally low fertilizer requirements, as it thrives in a variety of soil types, including disturbed and moderately fertile ground. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth appears weak, but it's often not necessary.
