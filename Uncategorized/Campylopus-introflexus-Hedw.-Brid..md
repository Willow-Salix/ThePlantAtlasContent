| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun exposure. Can tolerate some morning sun but should be shielded from intense, direct afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, but not waterlogged, conditions. Mimic frequent rainfall or high humidity; ensure good drainage to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Campylopus is a genus of 180 species of haplolepideous mosses (Dicranidae) in the family Leucobryaceae. The name comes from the Greek campylos, meaning curved, and pous, meaning foot, referring to the setae which curve downwards.

## Care Guide
Campylopus moss prefers consistently moist, well-draining, and acidic conditions with bright indirect light or partial sun. Avoid intense direct sun and waterlogging, as these can cause stress or rot. Due to its low nutrient needs, fertilization is generally unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Very low. This moss thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic substrates and does not require regular fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
