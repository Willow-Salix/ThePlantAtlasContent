# Woolly Cottonflower
### *Gossypianthus lanuginosus (Poir.) Moq.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest / Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), tolerates intense exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings; highly drought-tolerant, especially once established. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun, mimicking its native arid scrubland habitat in the Caribbean. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and has low fertilizer needs due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to nutrient-poor soils. If fertilized, use a diluted, balanced formula sparingly during the growing season.
