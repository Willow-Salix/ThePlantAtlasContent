## Introduction
Setaria is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family. The name is derived from the Latin word seta, meaning "bristle" or "hair", which refers to the bristly spikelets.
The genus includes over 100 species distributed in many tropical and temperate regions around the world, and members are commonly known as foxtail or bristle grasses.

## Care Guide
This hardy perennial grass thrives in full sun, adapting well to open grassland conditions. It requires moderate watering during its active growing season, with significant drought tolerance once established, and has low fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in moderately fertile soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer once a year in spring might be beneficial if soil nutrients are very poor.
