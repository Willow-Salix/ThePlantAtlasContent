## 🌱 Overview
Enhalus is a monotypic genus of marine flowering plants.  The sole species is Enhalus acoroides. Enhalus is a large seagrass native to coastal waters of the tropical Indian and Western Pacific Oceans. It is the only species of seagrass that does aerial surface pollination in which the pollen and the styles remain dry. Enhalus is surface pollinated with male flowers that detach from the plant to float on the surface until they reach a female flower where pollination can occur. Enhalus acoroides is considered a slow-growing, "climax" species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a true seagrass, Enhalus acoroides demands a tropical marine environment with high-intensity light and continuous submersion in stable saltwater. Provide a rich marine substrate and consider water column fertilization for optimal growth and health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in nutrient-rich marine substrate; benefits from supplemental water column fertilization designed for marine plants.
