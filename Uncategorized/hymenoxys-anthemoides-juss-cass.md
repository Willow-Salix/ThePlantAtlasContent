## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Andean regions of South America (e.g., Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Uruguay) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | High-altitude Semi-Arid Grassland (Puna biome) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open grassland native habitat at high altitudes. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth (simulating rainy season), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly during dormant periods (dry season). |

## 🌱 Overview
Hymenoxys (rubberweed or bitterweed) is a genus of plants in the sunflower family, native to North and South America. It was named by Alexandre Henri Gabriel de Cassini in 1828.
Plants of this genus are toxic to sheep due to the presence of the sesquiterpene lactone hymenoxon.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its high-altitude grassland origins. Water moderately during its growing season, allowing for dry periods, and provide minimal water during dormancy. It prefers well-draining soil and does not require heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor or moderately fertile soils found in its native grasslands. Use a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer sparingly during the growing season.
