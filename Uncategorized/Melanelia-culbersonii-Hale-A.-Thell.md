## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (primarily Pacific Northwest and Appalachian Mountains), parts of Europe and Asia |
| **Climate** | Temperate Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to filtered light; thrives in indirect light conditions common under forest canopies. Avoid direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and consistent moisture from mist, fog, or dew. Does not absorb water via roots and should not be 'watered' in the traditional sense; moisture is absorbed directly from the air. |

## Introduction
Melanelia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. These lichens typically grow on rocks and form relatively large, leaf-like structures with brown to blackish upper surfaces and pale undersides. The genus originally included many more species, but most have since been moved to related genera like Melanohalea and Melanelixia, leaving only five accepted species today.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, humid forest environments, requiring filtered light and high atmospheric moisture. It absorbs water and nutrients directly from the air, meaning traditional watering and fertilization are unnecessary and can be harmful. Maintaining high humidity and good air circulation is key to its care.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens obtain all necessary nutrients directly from the air, rainwater, and the substrate they grow on. Traditional fertilizers can be detrimental.
