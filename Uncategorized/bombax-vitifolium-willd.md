## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of South and Southeast Asia, including countries like India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and parts of China (information based on the broader Bombax genus, as 'Bombax vitifolium Willd.' is not a widely recognized species). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Monsoon Climate characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons, often found in tropical deciduous forests. |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun exposure, ideally 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its native environment as a prominent canopy tree. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires abundant and consistent watering during the growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Watering should be significantly reduced during the cooler, dormant, or dry season to prevent root rot, reflecting its deciduous nature. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bombax is a genus of  mainly tropical trees in the mallow family. They are native to western Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and the subtropical regions of East Asia and northern Australia. It is distinguished from the genus Ceiba, which has whiter flowers.
Common names for the genus include silk cotton tree, simal, red cotton tree, kapok, and simply bombax. Currently four species are recognised, although many plants have been placed in the genus that were later moved.
The genus is best known for the species Bombax ceiba, which is widely cultivated throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. It is native to southern and eastern Asia and northern Australia.
Bombax species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the leaf-miner Bucculatrix crateracma which feeds exclusively on Bombax ceiba.
The tree appears on the flag of Equatorial Guinea.
The tree fibers are 100% cellulose, able to float, impervious to water, and have a low thermal conductivity. Called Kapok in Asia, the fibers are mainly used for insulation in sleeping bags and life preservers. The fibers are also used as stuffing for pillows and mattresses.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant, likely a member of the *Bombax* genus, thrives in tropical monsoon climates, necessitating full sun and generous watering during its active growth. It requires a distinct dry period, mirroring its natural deciduous cycle, with reduced watering and fertilization during dormancy.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during its active growing period (spring and summer). Fertilization should be reduced or stopped during dormancy.
