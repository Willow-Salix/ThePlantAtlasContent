## 🧤 Care Instructions
Scarlet Gilia var. weberi requires full sun exposure and well-drained soil, mimicking its native montane dryland habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and fertilize very sparingly to support its preference for lean conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Accustomed to lean, rocky mountain soils. Fertilize sparingly in spring, if at all, using a diluted, balanced formula only if soil nutrients are visibly lacking.
