## 🧤 Care Instructions
Alkalisink Goldfields, an annual, thrives in full sun, characteristic of its native California vernal pool and alkali sink environments. It needs ample water during its spring growth and bloom period, followed by dry conditions as it completes its lifecycle. Minimal fertilization is required, with an emphasis on well-draining soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once during active growth in spring, or none if grown in naturally fertile soil. Avoid over-fertilization as it is adapted to specific soil conditions.
