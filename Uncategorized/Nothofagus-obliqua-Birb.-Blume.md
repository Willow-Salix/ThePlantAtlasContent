## Introduction
Nothofagus, also known as the southern beeches, is a genus of 43 species of trees and shrubs native to the Southern Hemisphere, found across southern South America (Chile, Argentina) and east and southeast Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. The species are ecological dominants in many temperate forests in these regions. Some species are reportedly naturalised in Germany and Great Britain. The genus has a rich fossil record of leaves, cupules, and pollen, with fossils extending into the late Cretaceous period and occurring in Australia, New Zealand, Antarctica, and South America.

## Care Guide
Roble Beech thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native temperate forest habitat. Provide regular water, particularly during active growth, and enrich the soil annually with compost or a balanced fertilizer to support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Prefers moderately rich, well-draining soil. Benefit from annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring.
