| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growing season in late winter and spring; allow soil to dry out between waterings. As an annual, it completes its lifecycle and requires little to no water during dry summer months. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Stinging Annual Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean climate. Water moderately during its spring growing season, then reduce significantly as it completes its annual lifecycle. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizer as it is a nitrogen-fixing plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, especially nitrogen, as it is a nitrogen-fixing legume that thrives in lean soils. Excess nutrients can hinder growth and flowering.
