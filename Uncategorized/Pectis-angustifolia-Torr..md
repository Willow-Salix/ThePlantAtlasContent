## Introduction
Pectis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1759.
The name is derived from the Latin word pecten, meaning "comb." It refers to the marginally-bristled leaves or the pappus form.  These plants vary in appearance but they usually bear yellow daisy-like flower heads. Members of the genus are known generally as cinchweeds (current usage) or chinchweeds (older name).
They are native to the Americas, including the West Indies.

## Care Guide
Lemonscent is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in sunny, arid conditions, mimicking its native desert habitat. Provide full sun and ensure infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications, as it is very drought-tolerant. Fertilization is rarely needed.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils.
