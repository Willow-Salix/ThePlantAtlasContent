## Introduction
Primula sect. Dodecatheon is a section of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. Primula species in this section were formerly placed in a separate genus, Dodecatheon. The species have basal clumps of leaves and nodding flowers that are produced at the top of tall stems rising from where the leaves join the crown. The genus is largely confined to North America and part of northeastern Siberia. Common names include shooting star, American cowslip, mosquito bills, mad violets, and sailor caps. A few species are grown in gardens for their showy and unique flower display.
The stamens are thrust out with the sepals bent back. The flowers are pollinated by bees, which grab hold of the petals, and gather pollen by vibrating the flowers by buzzing their wings (buzz pollination). The vibration releases pollen from the anthers.

## Care Guide
This perennial requires a wet winter and spring growing season, followed by a crucial dry summer dormancy period. Plant in full sun to partial shade and provide consistent moisture during active growth, then withhold water as temperatures rise to allow for dormancy.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light, balanced fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or often none is needed in good soil.
