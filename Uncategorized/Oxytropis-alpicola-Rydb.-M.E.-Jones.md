## Introduction
Oxytropis is a genus of plants in the legume family. It includes over 600 species native to subarctic to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. It is one of three genera of plants known as locoweeds, and are notorious for being toxic to grazing animals. The other locoweed genus is the closely related Astragalus. Most oxtropis species are native to Eurasia and North America, but several species are native to the Arctic. These are hairy perennial plants which produce raceme inflorescences of pink, purple, white, or yellow flowers which are generally pea-like but have distinctive sharply beaked keels. The stems are leafless, the leaves being all basal. The plant produces legume pods containing the seeds.

## Care Guide
This alpine native thrives in full sun and well-drained, rocky soils. Water moderately during its short growing season, allowing for dry periods, and avoid over-fertilization to mimic its naturally nutrient-scarce environment.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Use a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly, if at all, at the beginning of the growing season.
