## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida and Georgia) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Sandhills and Pine Flatwoods |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it naturally grows in open, exposed areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Its native sandy habitats suggest excellent drainage is crucial, and it can tolerate periods of drought once established. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Curtiss' Evening Primrose thrives in full sun and very well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its native habitat in the southeastern US. Provide moderate watering, ensuring the soil dries between applications, and avoid heavy fertilization as it prefers lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in lean to average soils and does not require heavy fertilization. Over-fertilization can reduce flowering.
