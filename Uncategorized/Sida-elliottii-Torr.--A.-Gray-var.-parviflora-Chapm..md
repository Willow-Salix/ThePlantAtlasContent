# Pineland Fanpetals

*Sida elliottii Torr. & A. Gray var. parviflora Chapm.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (specifically open pinelands and sandy clearings) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mirroring its native habitat in open, unshaded pinelands and clearings. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out completely between waterings. While native to a humid region, its preference for well-drained, often sandy soils means it doesn't tolerate consistently wet conditions but appreciates regular moisture during dry spells. |

## Care Guide
To care for Pineland Fanpetals, provide full sun exposure to mimic its native open pineland environment. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and apply fertilizer sparingly as it is adapted to less nutrient-rich soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, or a diluted liquid feed every 4-6 weeks during the growing season, is sufficient. Avoid heavy feeding as it's adapted to relatively lean pineland soils.
