## Introduction
Eugenia is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family Myrtaceae. It has a worldwide, although highly uneven, distribution in tropical and subtropical regions. The bulk of the approximately 1,100 species occur in the New World tropics, especially in the eastern Brazil's northern Andes, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Forest (coastal forests). Other centers of diversity include New Caledonia and Madagascar. Many species in the Old World have received a new classification into the genus Syzygium.
All species are woody evergreen trees and shrubs. Several are grown as ornamental plants for their attractive glossy foliage, and a few produce edible fruit that are eaten fresh or used in jams and jellies.

## Care Guide
This plant, thriving in subtropical to warm temperate conditions, is adaptable to a range of light from partial shade to full sun. It requires regular watering, allowing for slight drying between sessions, but can tolerate established drought. Provide moderate fertilization during its primary growth phases.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
