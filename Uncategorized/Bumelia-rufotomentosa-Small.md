## Introduction
Sideroxylon is a genus of trees in the family Sapotaceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753. They are collectively known as bully trees. The generic name is derived from the Greek words σιδηρος (sideros), meaning "iron", and ξύλον (xylon), meaning "wood."

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its native scrubland habitat. Provide infrequent but deep watering, allowing the soil to dry completely, and fertilize sparingly as it's adapted to poor nutrient conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, to avoid over-enrichment.
