| **Native Origin** | Northwestern North America, including Alaska, Yukon, British Columbia, and other parts of Canada, extending to Greenland. |
| **Climate** | Subalpine to Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) as it naturally grows in open, exposed alpine meadows, slopes, and tundra. |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent watering, preferring consistently moist but well-drained soil, especially during the growing season. Tolerates brief dry spells due to its deep taproot, but avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Arctic Lupine thrives in cold, subalpine to arctic environments, requiring full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it needs minimal to no fertilizer, making it relatively low-maintenance once established. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot, particularly in winter.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches its own soil and can be sensitive to excess nitrogen, which may inhibit flowering. A balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer or compost could be used if soil is exceptionally poor.
