## 🧤 Care Instructions
Arctic Lupine thrives in cold, subalpine to arctic environments, requiring full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it needs minimal to no fertilizer, making it relatively low-maintenance once established. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot, particularly in winter.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches its own soil and can be sensitive to excess nitrogen, which may inhibit flowering. A balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer or compost could be used if soil is exceptionally poor.
