| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (including much of the USA and Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest, Prairies, Woodlands, and disturbed open areas |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight, but can tolerate some afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerant of some drought once established, reflecting its adaptability in temperate zones with periods of rainfall and occasional dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Symphyotrichum lateriflorum (formerly Aster lateriflorus) is a species of flowering plant in the aster family (Asteraceae). Commonly known as calico aster, starved aster, and white woodland aster, it is native to eastern and central North America. It is a perennial and herbaceous plant that may reach heights up to 120 centimeters (4 feet) and widths up to 30 centimeters (1 foot).
The flowers of calico aster are small compared to most Symphyotrichum species. They have an average of 7–15 short white ray florets, which are rarely tinted pink or purple. The flower centers, composed of disk florets, begin as cream to yellow and often become pink, purple, or brown as they mature. There are roughly 8–16 disk florets, each with five lobes that strongly reflex (bend backwards) when open. The mostly hairless leaves have a characteristic hairy midrib on their back faces, and branching is usually horizontal or in what can appear to be a zigzag pattern. Flower heads grow along one side of the branches and sometimes in clusters at the ends.
Symphyotrichum lateriflorum is a conservationally secure species and grows in a variety of habitats. It can be found throughout most of the eastern and east-central United States and Canada. There is also a native population in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Its late-summer and fall appearing flowers are visited by small pollinators and nectar-seeking insects such as sweat bees, miner bees, and hoverflies. As well as occurring naturally in several varieties, S. lateriflorum has multiple cultivars and has been grown for at least 250 years in Europe. Some modern-day cultivars are 'Bleke Bet', 'Lady in Black', and 'Prince'. It has been used by Indigenous peoples of the Americas as a medicinal plant.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable perennial prefers full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil with moderate moisture. It is quite hardy and low-maintenance, typically requiring minimal fertilization. Ensure consistent watering, especially during dry periods, but allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced granular fertilizer in spring can be beneficial if the soil is particularly infertile.
