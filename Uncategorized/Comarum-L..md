## Introduction
Comarum palustre (syn. Potentilla palustris), known by the common name marsh cinquefoil, also purple marshlocks and swamp cinquefoil, is a waterside rhizomatous subshrub. It has a circumboreal distribution, occurring throughout cool temperate Asia, Europe, and North America, particularly in northern regions. It is most commonly found on lake shores, marshy riversides and stream margins, often partly submerged with foliage floating. It is a parent of some Fragaria–Comarum hybrids, ornamental plants produced by crossing with strawberries.

## Care Guide
To care for Marsh Cinquefoil, replicate its native wetland environment by providing consistently wet to saturated soil, ideally with some standing water. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires minimal fertilizer, adapting well to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal. Native to nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils, it does not require heavy fertilization and can be sensitive to excessive nutrients.
