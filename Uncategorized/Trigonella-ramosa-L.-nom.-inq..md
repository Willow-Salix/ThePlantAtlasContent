## Care Guide
Branched Fenugreek thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native temperate to semi-arid grasslands. It requires moderate watering during its growth cycle, showing some drought tolerance once established. As a legume, it benefits from low-nitrogen fertilization, enriching the soil itself.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires minimal nitrogen fertilization. A balanced, low-nitrogen feed or compost can support growth in poor soils.
