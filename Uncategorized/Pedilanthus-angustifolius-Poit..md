## Introduction
Calceolaria (), also called lady's purse, slipper flower and pocketbook flower, or slipperwort, is a genus of plants in the family Calceolariaceae, though classified in Scrophulariaceae by some authors. This genus consists of about 269 species of shrubs, lianas and herbs, and the geographical range extends from Patagonia to central Mexico, with its distribution centre in Andean region. Calceolaria species have usually yellow or orange flowers, which can have red or purple spots. The Calceolaria Herbeohybrida group, also called C. herbeohybrida Voss, is a group of ornamental hybrids known only in cultivation, called florists' slipperwort.

## Care Guide
This succulent-like plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mexican dry forests, preferring bright light and infrequent watering. Allow the soil to dry thoroughly between waterings and feed lightly during its growing period. Protect from frost and harsh, direct afternoon sun.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer (diluted to half strength) once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer). Do not fertilize in fall or winter.
