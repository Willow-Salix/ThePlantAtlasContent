## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida), Caribbean (e.g., Jamaica, Cuba, Puerto Rico), Central America, and northern South America. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Wetlands/Swamps |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. This plant thrives in open, brightly lit wetland environments. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to standing water conditions. It is a true aquatic or wetland plant, needing its roots constantly saturated or submerged. |

## Introduction
Cladium (fen-sedge, sawgrass or twig-sedge) is a genus of large sedges, with a nearly worldwide distribution in tropical and temperate regions. These are plants characterized by long, narrow (grass-like) leaves having sharp, often serrated (sawtooth-like) margins, and flowering stems 1–3 m tall bearing a much-branched inflorescence. Like many plants found in wet habitats, it has deeply buried rhizomes that can produce tall shoots with dense canopies.
Cladium mariscus subsp. jamaicense, or saw-grass, is common in marshes and savannas throughout the tropical Americas.  One typical and well-known area of extensive saw-grass growth is the Florida Everglades; sawgrass is the plant referred to by the descriptor, "River of Grass". Like many species of the Everglades, C. jamaicense grows in extremely infertile conditions, particularly wet sites that are low in phosphorus. Dense sawgrass beds are intermingled with other vegetation types. Together they produce a rich array of habitats that support the biological diversity of the Everglades. American alligators also use sawgrass to build nests. Phosphorus from agricultural runoff favoured dense cattail over rich sawgrass habitats, choking off water access for animals and birds. Eighty plant and animal species in the Everglades are threatened or endangered.
Cladium mariscoides, or twig-rush, is also a wetland plant, but is found further north, and in other kinds of wetlands including fens, wet meadows and pond shores. Owing to such specific habitat requirements, it is quite rare in the northern states such as Minnesota. "Finding a self-sustaining population of C. mariscoides on a lake shore is indeed a very rare event in Minnesota".
Cladium mariscus is frequently encountered in English fens. Its ability to form dense stands can lead to reduced plant diversity. Hence, it is sometimes mowed to reduce dominance.
Sawgrass may be useful as a source for developing biofuel (ethanol), possibly replacing corn as the cellulose (the basis for developing ethanol) source of choice. On Gotland, a limestone island in the Baltic sea, Cladium mariscus is used for thatching.

## Care Guide
Jamaica Swamp Sawgrass requires ample sunlight and consistently saturated or submerged conditions, mimicking its natural swamp habitat. It is crucial to maintain high moisture levels at all times. Moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula can promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. A slow-release, balanced aquatic fertilizer can support vigorous growth, particularly if not in a nutrient-rich naturalistic pond setting.
