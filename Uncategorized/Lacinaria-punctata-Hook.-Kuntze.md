## Introduction
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## Care Guide
Dotted Blazing Star thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native prairie habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and generally no or very little fertilizer. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally does not require much fertilization, especially in average garden soil. Over-fertilization can lead to weak growth. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring if soil is very poor.
