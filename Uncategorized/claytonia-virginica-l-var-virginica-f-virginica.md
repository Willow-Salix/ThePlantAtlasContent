## 🧤 Care Instructions
Virginia springbeauty is a spring ephemeral that needs bright light in early spring transitioning to partial or full shade as the weather warms. Keep its soil consistently moist during its brief active growth period. Allow the plant to go dormant with drier soil during summer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, well-draining soil with high organic matter. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can encourage vigorous growth, but is often not strictly necessary in good soil.
