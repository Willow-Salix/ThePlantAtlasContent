## Care Guide
This Mediterranean native thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Water moderately during its active growing season in winter and spring, then significantly reduce or withhold water during its summer dormancy. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires low to moderate fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring. Avoid overly rich soils.
