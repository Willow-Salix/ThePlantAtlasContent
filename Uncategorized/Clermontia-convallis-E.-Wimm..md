## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Maui and Molokai, Hawaii, USA |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to bright indirect light; avoid direct, harsh sun as it typically grows in the understory or mid-canopy of dense forests. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is key; the soil should be kept evenly moist but never waterlogged, reflecting the high rainfall and humidity of its native cloud forest habitat. Excellent drainage is critical. |

## Introduction
The Hawaiian lobelioids are a group of flowering plants in the bellflower family, Campanulaceae, subfamily Lobelioideae, all of which are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. This is the largest plant radiation in the Hawaiian Islands, and indeed the largest on any island archipelago, with over 125 species. The six genera involved can be broadly separated based on growth habit: Clermontia are typically branched shrubs or small trees, up to 7 metres (23 ft) tall, with fleshy fruits; Cyanea and Delissea are typically unbranched or branching only at the base, with a cluster of relatively broad leaves at the apex and fleshy fruits; Lobelia and Trematolobelia have long thin leaves down a single, non-woody stem and capsular fruits with wind-dispersed seeds; and the peculiar Brighamia have a short, thick stem with a dense cluster of broad leaves, elongate white flowers, and capsular fruits. The relationships among the genera and sections remains unsettled as of April 2022.
Many species have beautiful and spectacular flowers, especially those in Lobelia and Trematolobelia.  They are also highly vulnerable to feeding by feral ungulates such as feral pigs; the stems are only partly woody, and contain few defenses against herbivory.  The bark contains a milky (but apparently non-poisonous) latex, and is often chewed by rats and pigs.  Seedlings are also vulnerable to disturbance by pig digging, and in areas with high densities of pigs it is not uncommon to find the only lobelioids being epiphytic on larger trees or on fallen logs.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in conditions replicating its montane wet forest environment. Provide partial shade to bright indirect light, ensure consistently moist but well-draining soil, and maintain high humidity. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced feed during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season. Native soils in wet forests are often organically rich but can be leached of some nutrients.
