## Introduction
Pectis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1759.
The name is derived from the Latin word pecten, meaning "comb." It refers to the marginally-bristled leaves or the pappus form.  These plants vary in appearance but they usually bear yellow daisy-like flower heads. Members of the genus are known generally as cinchweeds (current usage) or chinchweeds (older name).
They are native to the Americas, including the West Indies.

## Care Guide
Pectis tenella DC. thrives in full direct sun and requires well-draining soil that is allowed to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its native tropical dry and semi-arid habitats. It is drought-tolerant and benefits from minimal fertilization during its growth period, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant adapted to harsh, dry conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied once every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season, but it is not a heavy feeder and can thrive in less fertile soils.
