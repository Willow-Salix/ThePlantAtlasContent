## Introduction
Torralbasia is a monotypic genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Celastraceae. It only contains the one known species, Torralbasia cuneifolia (C.Wright ex A.Gray) Krug & Urb.
It is native to the Caribbean and is found in the countries of Cuba, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.
The genus name of Torralbasia is in honour of José Ildefonso Torralbas (1842–1903), Cuban botanist and agronomist; director of the university botanical museum in Havana and professor at the university. The Latin specific epithet of cuneifolia means wedge-shaped, and is derived from cuneate.
Both the genus and the species were first described and published in D.H.Segui, Fl. Med. Tox. Cuba on page 60 in 1900.
There are 3 Accepted subspecies;

Torralbasia cuneifolia subsp. cuneifolia 
Torralbasia cuneifolia var. rotundata Borhidi
Torralbasia cuneifolia subsp. verrucosa Borhidi

## Care Guide
Torralbasia thrives in bright, direct sunlight and is highly drought-tolerant, mimicking its native Cuban dry forest habitat. Ensure excellent drainage and provide minimal fertilization to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization needs. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly once or twice during the growing season.
