## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Greenland) and parts of Northern Eurasia. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra / Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) reflecting its open, treeless native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Maintain consistently moist soil during the active growing season, allowing the top layer to dry slightly between waterings. Avoid waterlogging, ensure good drainage. |

## Introduction
Taraxacum () is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, which consists of species commonly known as dandelions. The scientific and hobby study of the genus is known as taraxacology. The genus has a near-cosmopolitan distribution, absent only from tropical and polar areas. Two of the most common species worldwide, T. officinale (the common dandelion) and T. erythrospermum (the red-seeded dandelion), are European species introduced into North America, where they are non-native. Dandelions thrive in temperate regions and can be found in yards, gardens, sides of roads, among crops, and in many other habitats.
Like other members of the family Asteraceae, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is called a floret. In part due to their abundance, along with being a generalist species, dandelions are one of the most vital early spring nectar sources for a wide host of pollinators. Many Taraxacum species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.

## Care Guide
This Arctic Dandelion thrives in full sun, reflecting its treeless tundra habitat, and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil during its active growth phase to mimic meltwater conditions. Adapted to nutrient-poor environments, it needs very minimal fertilization, if any. Ensure cool temperatures and good air circulation for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor; minimal to no fertilization is required. A weak, balanced fertilizer might be applied once a year in spring if growth appears sluggish.
