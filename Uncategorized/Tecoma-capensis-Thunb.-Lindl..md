## Introduction
Tecoma is a genus of seven species of shrubs or small trees in the trumpet vine family, Bignoniaceae. They are native to the Americas, ranging from the extreme southern United States through Central America and the Antilles south through Andean South America to northern Argentina. The generic name is derived from the Nahuatl word tecomaxochitl, which was applied by the indigenous peoples of Mexico to plants with tubular flowers. Trumpetbush is a common name for plants in this genus.

## Care Guide
This vigorous plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its subtropical origins. Provide regular water, especially during dry spells, but allow soil to dry slightly between waterings once established. Fertilize moderately to encourage abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season, particularly if soil is poor. Generally not a heavy feeder, but moderate fertility encourages vigorous growth and flowering.
