## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Great Basin region of the United States (e.g., California, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in exposed, open habitats. |
| **Watering** | Very low; adapted to drought conditions. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland habitat. Provide full sun and very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between waterings. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as it is adapted to poor, rocky soils.

### Fertilizer
Very low; native to nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very dilute solution during active growth.
