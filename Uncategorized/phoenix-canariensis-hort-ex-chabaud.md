## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, the Canary Island Date Palm requires full sun exposure and moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. Fertilize regularly during warmer months with a palm-specific formula to support robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high fertilization during the growing season (spring to fall) with a palm-specific fertilizer rich in potassium and magnesium.
