## 🌱 Overview
Epidendrum , abbreviated Epi in the horticultural trade, is a large neotropical genus of the orchid family. With more than 1,500 species,  some authors describe it as a mega-genus. The genus name (from Greek επί, epi and δένδρον, dendron, "upon trees") refers to its epiphytic growth habit.
When Carl Linnaeus named this genus in 1763, he included in this genus all the epiphytic orchids known to him. Although few of these orchids are still included in the genus Epidendrum, some species of Epidendrum are nevertheless not epiphytic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic orchid thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright indirect light. Water regularly, ensuring the medium dries slightly between waterings, and maintain high ambient humidity. Fertilize frequently with a dilute orchid formula to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize weekly to bi-weekly during active growth with a very dilute balanced orchid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/2 strength) to mimic nutrient uptake from rain and decaying organic matter.
