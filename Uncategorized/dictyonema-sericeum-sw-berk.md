### *Dictyonema sericeum (Sw.) Berk.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Caribbean, Central America, South America (Neotropics) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest, Cloud Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low to low, indirect light. Thrives in deeply shaded conditions, mimicking a dense forest understory. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity and consistent moisture are essential. Requires frequent misting or a humid terrarium-like environment, absorbing moisture from the air. Avoid stagnant water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dictyonema is a genus of mainly tropical basidiolichens in the family Hygrophoraceae. Unlike most lichens, which contain fungi related to yeasts and molds, Dictyonema species contain fungi more closely related to mushrooms. The genus includes about 40 recognized species found mainly in tropical regions, ranging from lowland forests to high mountain elevations up to 4,300 meters in the Andes. These lichens come in various forms, from crusty patches to leaf-like structures to thread-like mats, and most grow on soil, rocks, moss, or rotting logs. One species from the Amazon rainforest has traditional use by indigenous peoples as a hallucinogenic substance in shamanic rituals.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dictyonema sericeum thrives in a highly humid environment with very low, indirect light, replicating its native tropical cloud forest habitat. Consistent atmospheric moisture is crucial, often requiring frequent misting. This lichen needs no external fertilization, as it is highly sensitive to added nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens are extremely sensitive to external nutrients and derive their needs from the air and their substrate.
