## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Georgia, Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Mississippi) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Temperate Woodland and Grassland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is preferred, mimicking the moderate rainfall of its native habitat. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings, avoiding both prolonged drought and waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lactuca, commonly known as lettuce, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The genus includes at least 50 species, distributed worldwide, but mainly in temperate Eurasia.
Its best-known representative is the garden lettuce (Lactuca sativa), with its many varieties. "Wild lettuce" commonly refers to the wild-growing relatives of common garden lettuce. Many species are common weeds. Lactuca species are diverse and take a wide variety of forms. They are annuals, biennials, perennials, or shrubs. Their flower heads have yellow, blue, or white ray florets. Some species are bitter-tasting.
Most wild lettuces are xerophytes, adapted to dry habitat types. Some occur in more moist areas, such as the mountains of central Africa.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Arrowleaf Lettuce thrives in conditions similar to its native Southeastern US, requiring abundant sunlight and consistent, yet not excessive, moisture. It adapts well to various soil types and benefits from moderate fertilization during its primary growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from average soil fertility. A light application of a balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer) is generally sufficient.
