## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid Montane Coniferous Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, as it grows on the exposed branches of host pine trees. |
| **Watering** | Low, as it is a parasitic plant that obtains all its water from its host tree, which is adapted to regions with moderate to low seasonal rainfall. |

## Introduction
The genus Arceuthobium, commonly called dwarf mistletoes, is a genus of 42 species of parasitic plants that parasitize members of Pinaceae and Cupressaceae in North America, Central America, Asia, Europe, and Africa. Of the 42 species that have been recognized, 39 and 21 of these are endemic to North America and the United States, respectively. They all have very reduced shoots and leaves (mostly reduced to scales) with the bulk of the plant living under the host's bark. Recently the number of species within the genus has been reduced to 26 as a result of more detailed genetic analysis.

## Care Guide
This plant is an obligate parasite, incapable of independent cultivation. Its 'care' is entirely dependent on maintaining the health of its host pine tree, which thrives in full to partial sun conditions within semi-arid montane environments with low water and nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
None directly, as it obtains all necessary nutrients parasitically from its host tree, which typically grows in naturally lean montane forest soils.
