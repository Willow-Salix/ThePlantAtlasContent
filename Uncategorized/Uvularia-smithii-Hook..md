## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, encompassing regions from eastern Canada south to Florida and west to parts of the Midwest U.S. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Part shade to full shade. Prefers dappled sunlight or morning sun with protection from harsh afternoon sun, mimicking its native understory habitat. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil. Water regularly, especially during dry spells and the active growing season in spring, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Uvularia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Colchicaceae, which is closely related to the lily family (Liliaceae). They are commonly called bellworts, bellflowers, or merrybells. The genus name is derived from the Latin ūvula meaning "little grape", likely because of the way the flowers hang downward. For the same reason Uvularia may also refer to the similarly derived palatine uvula, which hangs down from the soft palate in the mouth. The plants are often found growing on wooded slopes or in ravines and they spread by stolons, or stoloniferous rhizomes. The plants are usually 45–60 cm (18–24 in) in height and bear one or two flowers per stem in April and May, that hang downward from the axils of the leaves.

## Care Guide
Uvularia smithii Hook. (treated as a typical Bellwort) thrives in conditions similar to its native temperate deciduous forest understory. Provide consistently moist, humus-rich soil in a location with part to full shade, protecting it from intense afternoon sun. A spring application of compost will support its growth and delicate blooms.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, organic soil. Apply a layer of compost or a light, balanced slow-release organic fertilizer in early spring as new growth emerges.
