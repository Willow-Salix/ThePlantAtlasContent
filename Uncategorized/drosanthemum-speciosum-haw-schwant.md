## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Royal Dewflower thrives in bright, direct sunlight, mimicking its native arid scrubland habitat. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to completely dry out between applications to prevent rot. Provide well-draining soil and minimal fertilization for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; a diluted, balanced succulent fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the active growing season.
