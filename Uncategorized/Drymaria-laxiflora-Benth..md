## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright, open conditions reminiscent of its desert homeland. Provide ample sunlight and practice infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to fully dry out between sessions. Minimal fertilization is required, making it a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, using a very diluted balanced fertilizer once a year during its active growing season.
