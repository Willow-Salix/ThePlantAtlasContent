# Little Snapdragon-vine

*Coriflora fremontii (S. Watson) W.A. Weber* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah), Northern Mexico, Central America |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Semi-Arid Canyons |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant; water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot, especially during cooler months. |

## Care Guide
This vining plant thrives in conditions that mimic its native arid and semi-arid environments, demanding full sun and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization. Ensure good air circulation to maintain plant health.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; its native rocky and dry soils suggest it thrives with minimal nutrients. A light, balanced fertilizer once in spring is sufficient if grown in poor soil or containers.
