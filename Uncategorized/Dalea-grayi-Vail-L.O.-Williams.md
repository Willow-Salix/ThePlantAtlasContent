## Introduction
Dalea  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as prairie clover or indigo bush. Its name honors English apothecary Samuel Dale (1659–1739). They are native to the Western hemisphere, where they are distributed from Canada to Argentina. Nearly half of the known species are endemic to Mexico. Two species of Dalea (Dalea ornata and Dalea searlsiae) have been considered for rangeland restoration.

## Care Guide
Gray's prairie clover thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its native humid subtropical scrubland habitat. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and is drought-tolerant once established. As a legume, it needs minimal to no nitrogen fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low to no nitrogen fertilizer needed. Can benefit from a general-purpose, low-nitrogen fertilizer sparingly in very poor soils.
