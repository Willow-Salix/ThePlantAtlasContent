## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across tropical and warm temperate regions globally, including parts of Atlantic Europe, Macaronesia, Africa, Asia, Oceania, North and South America. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forests, often in oceanic or high-humidity environments. |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to very bright, indirect light. As an epiphytic liverwort, it typically grows in the understory or on shaded substrates, avoiding direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Constant high humidity and consistent moisture are critical. It should never be allowed to dry out completely. Regular misting, high ambient humidity (e.g., terrarium), or placement in a paludarium is necessary. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
This minute liverwort thrives in conditions mimicking its native humid forest habitats. Provide consistently high humidity, frequent moisture, and low to indirect light, avoiding any direct sun or drying periods. Fertilizer is generally not required.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Bryophytes have very low nutrient requirements, typically absorbing what they need from rainwater and atmospheric deposition. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
