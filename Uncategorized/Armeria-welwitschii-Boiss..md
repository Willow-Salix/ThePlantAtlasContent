## Introduction
Armeria is a genus of flowering plants.  These plants are sometimes known as "lady's cushion", "thrift", or "sea pink" (the latter because as they are often found on coastlines).  The genus counts over a hundred species, mostly native to the Mediterranean, although Armeria maritima is an exception, being distributed along the coasts of the Northern Hemisphere, including Ireland, parts of the United Kingdom such as Cornwall, and the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park in Wales.
Some are popular with gardeners as rockery plants.
During the Second World War, the UK "thruppenny bit" coin (3 old pence), which had featured a portcullis on its reverse side, changed to a depiction of the thrift plant, as a means of reminding the population of the need to avoid waste and practise thrift.  After the war, it reverted to the portcullis

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, poor soils, reflecting its native coastal Mediterranean habitat. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering during growth and little during hot, dry periods, with minimal fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
