## Introduction
Stipa is a genus of about 140 species of large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and  spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to Stipa, which have since been reclassified into new genera.
Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as Stipa brachytricha, S. arundinacea, S. splendens, S. gigantea and S. pulchra are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.
It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.

## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and dry conditions, typical of its Mediterranean origin. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering. Fertilization is rarely needed, making it a low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally not required. If soil is very poor, a light annual application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial.
