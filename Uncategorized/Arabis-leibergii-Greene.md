## Care Guide
Leiberg's Rockcress is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering due to its drought-tolerant nature. It prefers well-drained, rocky soils and benefits from very little fertilization, mimicking its native habitat on dry, exposed slopes in Western North America.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-drained soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring, or none at all if soil is already suitable, is sufficient.
