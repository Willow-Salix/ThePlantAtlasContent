## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and alpine regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including Scandinavia, Greenland, mountainous areas of Europe, and North American Arctic. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, Boreal/Subarctic zones. |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure is common in its native exposed rock habitats, tolerating full sun. However, it requires consistent moisture to thrive in such conditions. |
| **Watering** | Frequent wetting from rain, snowmelt, or mist; thrives with high atmospheric humidity. Tolerates periods of desiccation between moistening events. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
This Arctic-alpine lichen requires cold temperatures, high atmospheric humidity, and frequent wetting to mimic its native conditions. It thrives on exposed, unshaded rocky substrates and does not need soil or traditional fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air, rainwater, and the substrate itself, not from traditional fertilizers.
