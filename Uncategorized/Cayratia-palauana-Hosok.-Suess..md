## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Palau (Caroline Islands, Micronesia) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. As a rainforest vine, it benefits from diffused light and avoids harsh, direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, mimicking the frequent rainfall of its native habitat. Requires high humidity. |

## Introduction
Cayratia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Vitaceae. It consists of species of vine plants, typical of the tribe Cayratieae. Some of them are used by humans, and they are found in tropical and subtropical areas of Asia, Africa, Australia, and islands of the Pacific Ocean.
Within the Vitaceae, Cayratia is most closely related to Tetrastigma and Cyphostemma. As previously configured, the genus Cayratia was found not be monophyletic (for example, C. japonica was moved to Causonis being distinct from Cayratia pedata, the type species).

## Care Guide
To care for this tropical vine, provide bright indirect light and ensure high humidity, replicating its rainforest origins. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil and fertilize regularly during periods of active growth.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize regularly during the active growing season (spring through summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength.
