## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in very high humidity and indirect light, typical of its native tropical forest habitat. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture and should never be fertilized with traditional plant nutrients, as it obtains necessary elements from its environment.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required; lichens absorb nutrients from the air and rainwater, and are sensitive to air pollution.
