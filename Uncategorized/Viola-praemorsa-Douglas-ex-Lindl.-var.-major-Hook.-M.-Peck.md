## Care Guide
This violet thrives in temperate conditions with partial to full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide regular watering, especially during dry spells, and enrich the soil with organic matter or a light spring fertilization. It prefers cooler temperatures and some afternoon shade in hotter climates.

### Fertilizer
