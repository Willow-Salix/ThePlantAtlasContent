# Piper's Quillwort
### *Isoetes piperi A.A. Eaton*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (specifically Washington, Oregon, and California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Vernal Pool (Mediterranean Climate) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun when actively growing and submerged. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires complete submersion in water during its active growth phase (winter/spring), followed by a dry dormancy period in summer where the substrate should be allowed to dry out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of lycopod. It is the only living genus in the family Isoetaceae and order Isoetales. As of 2016, there were about 200 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution mostly in aquatic habitats but with the individual species often scarce to rare. Species virtually identical to modern quillworts have existed since the Jurassic epoch, though the timing of the origin of modern Isoetes is subject to considerable uncertainty.
The name of the genus may also be spelled Isoëtes. The diaeresis (two dots over the e) indicates that the o and the e are to be pronounced in two distinct syllables. Including this in print is optional; either spelling (Isoetes or Isoëtes) is correct.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This unique quillwort demands a seasonal care routine, including an extended period of full submersion in water during its active growth phase in cooler, brighter conditions. Crucially, it must undergo a complete dry dormancy in summer, with the substrate allowed to totally dehydrate, to ensure its long-term survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; native vernal pool soils are typically nutrient-poor. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a highly diluted solution during active growth.
