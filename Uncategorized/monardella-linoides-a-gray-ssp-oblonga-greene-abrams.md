## 🌱 Overview
Monardella is a genus of approximately 40 species of annual and perennial plants native to western North America from British Columbia to northwestern Mexico. They are grown for their highly aromatic foliage, which in some species is used for herbal teas. The two-lipped, tubular flowers are formed in terminal clusters and are most usually red, pink, or purple.
Monardella is a Latin diminutive form of Monarda (a taxonomic patronym honoring the Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes), which the form of the flower heads resembles.  Plants in this genus are commonly known as wildmints, coyote mints or monardellas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Flaxleaf Monardella is an adaptable, low-maintenance plant ideal for dry, sunny landscapes. Provide full sun and ensure excellent drainage, mimicking its native chaparral environment. Water sparingly once established, as it is highly drought-tolerant, and avoid heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean, well-draining soil and generally does not require fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
