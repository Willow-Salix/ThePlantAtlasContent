## 🧤 Care Instructions
Louseworts thrive in cool, consistently moist environments with bright light, reflecting their alpine and subalpine origins. Ensure the soil remains perpetually damp and avoid over-fertilization due to their hemi-parasitic nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As hemi-parasitic plants, they derive a significant portion of their nutrients from host plants; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
