## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Bahamas, Greater Antilles (Caribbean) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Dry Forest and Coastal Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is ideal for robust growth and abundant flowering. Tolerates partial sun but flowering may be reduced. |
| **💧 Water** | Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. This plant is highly drought-tolerant once established. Water regularly during active growth periods, but reduce frequency in cooler or dormant seasons. Avoid waterlogging at all costs. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lantana () is a genus of about 150 species of perennial flowering plants in the verbena family, Verbenaceae. They are native to tropical regions of the Americas and Africa but exist as an introduced species in numerous areas, especially in the Australian-Pacific region, South and Northeastern part of India. The genus includes both herbaceous plants and shrubs growing to 0.5–2 m (1.6–6.6 ft) tall. Their common names are shrub verbenas or lantanas. The generic name originated in Late Latin, where it refers to the unrelated Viburnum lantana.
Lantana's aromatic flower clusters (called umbels) are a mix of red, orange, yellow, or blue and white florets. Other colors exist as new varieties are being selected. The flowers typically change color as they mature, resulting in inflorescences that are two- or three-colored.
"Wild lantanas" are plants of the unrelated genus Abronia, usually called "sand-verbenas".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant, likely a Lantana species from the subtropical Caribbean, thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, allowing soil to dry thoroughly between sessions. Fertilization should be minimal to encourage abundant flowering rather than excessive foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization, if any, is sufficient. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once or twice during the growing season (spring/summer) is generally adequate. Over-fertilization can promote foliage growth at the expense of flowers.
