## Care Guide
This fern thrives in conditions replicating its native tropical montane cloud forest, demanding very high humidity and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide bright, indirect light and protect it from direct sun, fertilizing sparingly during its growth period.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half or quarter strength, every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease in winter.
