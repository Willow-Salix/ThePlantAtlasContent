## Care Guide
Nuttall's Toothwort thrives in conditions similar to its native moist, temperate forest understory. Provide partial to full shade and ensure the soil remains consistently moist, rich in organic matter, and well-draining. Avoid direct sun and allow for regular moisture for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from nutrient-rich, well-draining soil with high organic matter content, mimicking forest floor conditions. Supplemental balanced, diluted fertilizer or compost can be applied sparingly during active growth.
