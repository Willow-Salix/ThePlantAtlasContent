## 🌱 Overview
Honeysuckles are arching shrubs or twining vines in the genus Lonicera () of the family Caprifoliaceae. The genus includes 158 species native to northern latitudes in North America, Eurasia, and North Africa. Widely known species include Lonicera periclymenum (common honeysuckle or woodbine), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle, white honeysuckle, or Chinese honeysuckle) and Lonicera sempervirens (coral honeysuckle, trumpet honeysuckle, or woodbine honeysuckle). L. japonica is a highly invasive species considered a significant pest in parts of North America, Europe, South America, New Zealand, Australia, and Africa.
Some species are highly fragrant and colorful, so are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. In North America, hummingbirds are attracted to the flowers, especially L. sempervirens and L. ciliosa (orange honeysuckle). Honeysuckle derives its name from the edible sweet nectar obtainable from its tubular flowers. The name Lonicera stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate honeysuckle prefers a site with full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimicking its native forest habitat, it benefits from moderate watering and a light annual feeding with compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. An annual application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is generally sufficient, as forest soils are naturally enriched by decaying organic matter.
