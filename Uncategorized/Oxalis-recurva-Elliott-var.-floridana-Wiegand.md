## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida, Georgia, Alabama) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. While it can tolerate some morning sun, it benefits from afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, mimicking its native environment's rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Oxalis ( (British English) or  (American English)) is a large genus of flowering plants in the wood-sorrel family, Oxalidaceae, comprising over 550 species. The genus occurs throughout most of the world, except for the polar areas; species diversity is particularly rich in tropical Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.
Many of the species are known as wood-sorrels (also as wood sorrels or woodsorrels) as they have an acidic taste reminiscent of the sorrel proper (Rumex acetosa), which is not closely related. Some species are called yellow sorrels or pink sorrels after the colour of their flowers instead. Other species are colloquially known as false shamrocks, and some called sourgrasses. For the genus as a whole, the term oxalises is also used.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions typical of its humid subtropical origins, preferring bright indirect light to partial sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It benefits from regular watering and light fertilization during its active growth phases to encourage vibrant foliage and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Light, balanced liquid fertilizer applied monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
