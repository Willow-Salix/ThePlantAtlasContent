## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic regions, including Greenland, Svalbard, northern Canada, Alaska, northern Scandinavia, and northern Russia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic Tundra / Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Tolerates a wide range from bright, indirect light to full sun exposure when available, typical of open tundra environments. Long periods of low light are also tolerated. |
| **💧 Water** | As a lichen, it absorbs moisture directly from the air and precipitation. Requires periods of hydration (e.g., from misting or rain) but is highly tolerant of desiccation. Avoid constant wetness of the substrate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rinodina is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 265 species. It is hypothesized that a few saxicolous species common to dry regions of western North America, southern Europe, North Africa and central Asia may date back 240 million years to the Middle Triassic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cold, exposed environments, tolerating both bright light and long periods of low light. It requires infrequent hydration from ambient moisture or mist, being highly adapted to cycles of wetting and drying. No fertilization is needed, as it sources nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens do not require traditional fertilization; they obtain nutrients from the air, rain, and the substrate they grow on.
