## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable grass thrives in temperate forest conditions, preferring consistently moist, well-drained soil and tolerating a range from partial shade to full sun. It requires regular watering to maintain soil moisture and benefits from a light spring fertilization in poorer soils to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
