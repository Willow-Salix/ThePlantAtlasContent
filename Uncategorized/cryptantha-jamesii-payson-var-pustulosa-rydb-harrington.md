## 🌱 Overview
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy or gravelly soils, typical of its native arid and semi-arid habitats. It requires very little water and minimal to no fertilization, making it suitable for xeriscaping or low-maintenance gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; generally thrives in poor, lean soils and does not require fertilization. If growth seems poor, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly in early spring.
