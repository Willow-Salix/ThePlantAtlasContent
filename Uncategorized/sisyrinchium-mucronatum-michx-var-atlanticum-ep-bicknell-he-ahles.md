## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern United States (Atlantic Coastal Plain, from New England south to Georgia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Wetland/Grassland (Humid Subtropical to Humid Continental) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Shade, preferring open, bright conditions like meadows and grassy fields. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is key, replicating its native moist to wet meadow habitats; water regularly to keep soil consistently damp but not waterlogged, especially during dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sisyrinchium is a large genus of annual to perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. Native to the New World, the species are known as blue-eyed grasses. Although they are not true grasses (Poaceae), they are monocots.
Several species in the eastern United States are threatened or endangered. This may be due to niche species emerging from their unique tendency toward rapid speciation which helps them adapt to specialized arenic (sandy) habitats.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Eastern Blue-eyed Grass flourishes in locations receiving full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular watering is crucial to mimic its naturally damp habitats, while fertilizer requirements are minimal, thriving in average to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil is poor, otherwise it often thrives without much added nutrient.
