## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands |
| **Climate** | Tropical Mesic to Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to bright indirect light, emulating the understory of a tropical forest. Avoid harsh, direct midday sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged. Water thoroughly when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry to the touch, ensuring good drainage. |

## Introduction
Alyxia stellata, known as maile in Hawaiian, is a species of flowering plant in the dogbane family, Apocynaceae, that is native to the tropical Pacific from Queensland to Hawaii. It grows as either a twining liana, scandent shrub, or small erect shrub, and is one of the few vines that are endemic to the islands. The leaves are usually ternate, sometimes opposite, and can show both types on the same stem. Flowers are quite inconspicuous and have a sweet and light fragrance of honey. The bark is most fragrant and exudes a slightly sticky, milky sap when punctured, characteristic of the family Apocynaceae.  The entire plant contains coumarin, a sweet-smelling compound that is also present in vanilla grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), woodruff (Galium odoratum) and mullein (Verbascum spp.).  Fruit are oval and dark purple when ripe.  Maile is a morphologically variable plant and the Hawaiian names reflect this (see Ethnobotany section).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native Hawaiian mesic to wet forest environment. Provide consistently moist, well-drained soil and partial shade to bright indirect light. Moderate fertilization during warmer months and high humidity are key to successful growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength, applied monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease in fall and winter.
