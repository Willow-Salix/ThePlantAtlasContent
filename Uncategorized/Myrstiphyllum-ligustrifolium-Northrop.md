## Introduction
Psychotria is a large genus of flowering plants in the coffee family Rubiaceae, with over 1,600 species. The genus has a pantropical distribution and members of the genus are small understorey trees in tropical forests. Some species are endangered or facing extinction due to deforestation, especially species of central Africa and the Pacific.
Many species, including Psychotria viridis, produce the psychedelic chemical dimethyltryptamine (DMT).

## Care Guide
This subtropical understory plant thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright indirect light. Maintain consistent soil moisture, allowing the top layer to dry slightly before rewatering, and provide light fertilization during active growth. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer), reducing or ceasing in fall and winter.
