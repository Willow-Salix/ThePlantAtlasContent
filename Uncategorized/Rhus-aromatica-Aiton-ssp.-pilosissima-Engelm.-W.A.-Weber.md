## Introduction
Sumac or sumach ( S(H)OO-mak, UK also )—not to be confused with poison sumac—is any of the roughly 35 species of flowering plants in the genus Rhus (and related genera) of the cashew and mango tree family, Anacardiaceae. However, it is Rhus coriaria that is most commonly used for culinary purposes. Sumac is prized as a spice—especially in Iranian cuisine, and other Eastern cuisines—and used as a dye and holistic remedy. The plants grow in subtropical and temperate regions, on nearly every continent except Antarctica and South America.
Native to Persia, it holds cultural significance as a symbolic item on the Haft-sin table during Nowruz, the Persian New Year.

## Care Guide
This subspecies of Fragrant Sumac thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native arid and semi-arid environment. It requires minimal watering once established due to its excellent drought tolerance and generally does not need heavy fertilization. Overall, it's a low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. If necessary, a light application of balanced granular fertilizer in spring is sufficient, especially in poor soils.
