## Introduction
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## Care Guide
This beaksedge thrives in consistently wet to boggy conditions, mimicking its native subtropical wetland habitat, and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, it has very low fertilizer needs and should be watered frequently to maintain saturation.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor wetland soils. Fertilize sparingly with a very diluted solution if growth is slow.
