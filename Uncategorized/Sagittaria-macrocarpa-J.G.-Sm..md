## Introduction
Sagittaria is a genus of about 30 species of aquatic plants whose members are referred to by the Native American word wapato () and a variety of other common names, including arrowhead, duck potato, swamp potato, tule potato, and katniss. Most are native to South, Central, and North America, but there are also some from Europe, Africa, and Asia.

## Care Guide
This aquatic plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently wet to submerged soil conditions, mimicking its native freshwater wetland habitat. Provide moderate fertilization, particularly during active growth, to support its health and development in an aquatic environment.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from nutrient-rich aquatic substrate or occasional aquatic plant fertilizer during the growing season.
