## Introduction
Bothriochloa is a common and widespread genus of plants in the grass family native to many countries on all inhabited continents and many islands. They are often called beardgrass, bluegrass or bluestem. Some species are invasive in areas where they have been introduced.
The etymology of the genus name Bothriochloa derives from the two ancient Greek words βοθρίον (bothríon), meaning "small pit or trench", and χλόη or χλόα (khlóa), meaning "new green shoot or blade of grass".
An specimens of Bothriochloa from Gooty Fort Hill, Andhra Pradesh, India was collected in December 2019 and identified as Bothriochloa ewartiana (Domin) C. E. Hubb. based on literature study and international correspondence with experts from Australia, Indonesia and Americas. This study adds an extended and disjunct distribution of a Far Eastern species in Asia from India.

## Care Guide
Bothriochloa Hassleri is a resilient grass that thrives in full sun, characteristic of its humid subtropical grassland origins. It prefers moderate watering with soil allowed to dry slightly between sessions, and it requires only low to moderate fertilization to maintain its health and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to average soil fertility, it generally requires minimal fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied once in spring can support robust growth if needed.
