## Care Guide
This tropical climber thrives in warm, humid conditions with abundant sunlight and consistent soil moisture. Provide rich, well-draining soil and regular fertilization during its growing period to support its vigorous growth and fragrant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer applied every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
