## Care Guide
This grass thrives in full sun and very well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its native pine barren habitat. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and has very low fertilizer needs due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
