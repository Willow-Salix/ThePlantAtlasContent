## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia (a narrow strip between Mandurah and Busselton) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean climate (hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its growth in open woodlands. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry Mediterranean summers. Young trees require regular watering until established, after which infrequent deep watering is sufficient, especially during prolonged dry periods. |

## Introduction
Eucalyptus gomphocephala, known as tuart, is a species of tree and is one of the six forest giants of Southwest Australia. 
The trees usually grow to a height of 10 to 40 m (33 to 131 ft) and mostly have a single stem, but can have multiple stems under some conditions. The crown can be as wide as 25 metres (82 ft). It has rough box-like bark over the length of the trunk and larger branches. The glossy light-green to green adult leaves are arranged alternately and have an oval to lanceolate or falcate shape, and have a leaf blade that is 90 to 180 millimetres (3.5 to 7.1 in) long and 1.5 to 3 cm (0.59 to 1.18 in) wide. The tree flowers between January and April with white to cream inflorescences that form in the leaf axils and are not branched. The fruits that follow have an obconic to upside-down bell shape.
Tuarts were first formally described by the botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1828. The botanist Jean-Baptiste Leschenault assembled the type collection at the Vasse River near Geographe Bay during 1802, while serving with the Baudin expedition.
The distribution range of tuart is along a narrow coastal corridor within the Swan Coastal Plain, extending inland 5 to 10 kilometres (3.1 to 6.2 mi), a continuous corridor south from Yanchep to Busselton. Tuart forest was common on the Swan coastal plain until the valuable trees were felled for export and displaced by the urban development around Perth. The wood has many uses as it is dense, hard and water resistant and resists splintering. Remnants of tuart forest occur in state reserves and parks; the tree has occasionally been introduced to other regions of Australia and overseas. Remaining trees are vulnerable to Phytophthora dieback, an often fatal disorder. It was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as of 2019.

## Care Guide
The Tuart thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its Mediterranean native climate. It prefers well-draining soils and has low fertilizer needs, particularly sensitive to high phosphorus levels. Establish with moderate watering, then reduce significantly for mature plants.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs, sensitive to high phosphorus. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus native plant fertilizer sparingly only if growth is poor, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor Australian soils.
