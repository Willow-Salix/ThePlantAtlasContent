## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
Applegate's rim lichen, an epiphytic organism, thrives in bright indirect to partial sun and high atmospheric humidity typical of temperate open woodlands. It requires regular misting and good air circulation, but no soil or traditional fertilizers, as it absorbs all needs directly from the air.

### Fertilizer
None; lichens are highly sensitive to chemical fertilizers and derive nutrients from the atmosphere
