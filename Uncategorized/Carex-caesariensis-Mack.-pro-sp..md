## Introduction
The Cyperaceae () are a family of  graminoid (grass-like), monocotyledonous flowering plants known as sedges. The family is large; botanists have described some 5,500 known species in about 90 genera – the largest being the "true sedges" (genus Carex), with over 2,000 species.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in conditions mirroring its native temperate dry-mesic woodlands. Provide partial sun to partial shade and ensure moderate, consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization needs are low, typically only requiring a light feeding if plant health appears to be declining.

### Fertilizer
Low; sedges are not heavy feeders. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth appears weak, otherwise minimal to none.
