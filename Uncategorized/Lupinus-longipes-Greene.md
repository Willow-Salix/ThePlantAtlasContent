| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine (Coniferous Forest, Alpine Meadows) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily). |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist, but well-drained soil, especially during its growing season. Tolerant of some drought once established, mimicking dry summer periods in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
This montane lupine flourishes in full to partial sun and well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its natural habitat in the Sierra Nevada. It requires moderate watering, particularly during growth, but tolerates some drought once mature, and generally needs no supplemental fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils; avoid rich, heavy soils and over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen.
