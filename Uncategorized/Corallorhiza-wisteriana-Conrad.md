## 🌱 Overview
Corallorhiza wisteriana, the spring coralroot or Wister's coralroot, is a species of coralroot orchid. It is widespread through much of Mexico as well as parts of the United States (Rocky Mountains, Appalachians, the Southeast, and the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys).
Spring coralroot blooms as early as December in Florida through early spring in other parts of the country. The flowers generally only last a few hours.
This plant prefers leaf litter in woodland areas and is mycotrophic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cultivating Spring Coralroot is exceptionally challenging due to its mycoheterotrophic nature, relying entirely on complex symbiotic relationships with specific fungi and host trees for survival. Traditional care practices, including fertilization, are not applicable and can be detrimental. Successful cultivation outside its native forest ecosystem with these intricate networks is virtually impossible.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. As a mycoheterotrophic orchid, it obtains all nutrients from specific fungi linked to host trees, rendering traditional fertilization unnecessary and potentially harmful to its delicate symbiotic relationships.
