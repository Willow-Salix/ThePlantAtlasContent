## Care Guide
Merritt thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, emulating its native semi-arid conditions. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing infrequent watering, and is sensitive to high phosphorus fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is typically required in suitable soil. If needed, use a low-phosphorus, slow-release native plant formula very sparingly.
