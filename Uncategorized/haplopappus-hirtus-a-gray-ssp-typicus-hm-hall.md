## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean climate. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, preferring dry conditions. Fertilization is typically unnecessary, making it a low-maintenance choice for arid or semi-arid gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean, well-draining soil. Fertilization is generally not required, or a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring if growth seems stunted.
