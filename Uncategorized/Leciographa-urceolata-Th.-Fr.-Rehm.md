## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pantropical regions, found across various continents including North America (e.g., Florida), South America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Rainforests and Humid Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Filtered light to partial shade, typically found on tree bark in environments with dense canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and frequent moisture from rainfall or misting; does not tolerate prolonged dry periods or standing water. |

## Introduction
Opegrapha is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Opegraphaceae. These lichens form crusty patches on bark, rock, or other lichens, and are easily recognized by their distinctive black, slit-like or rounded fruiting bodies that look like tiny scribbles or dashes on the surface. The genus includes more than 100 species found worldwide, with most partnering with orange-pigmented green algae, though some live as parasites on other lichens.

## Care Guide
Leciographa urceolata is a pantropical lichen thriving in high humidity and filtered light, commonly found growing on tree bark. Its care involves maintaining consistent moisture through ambient humidity and rainfall, while traditional fertilization is unnecessary as it obtains nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens are self-sufficient organisms that derive necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate, and do not benefit from traditional fertilizers.
