## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Mt. Diablo Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native dry Mediterranean climate. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering primarily during prolonged dry spells. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it typically needs no fertilization and prefers lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Generally not needed. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in lean soils and excessive nitrogen can be detrimental. If soil is exceptionally poor, a low-nitrogen, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
