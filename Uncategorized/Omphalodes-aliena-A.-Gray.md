## Introduction
Omphalodes (navelwort) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It includes eleven species native to Europe and western Asia. In spring they produce blue or white flowers similar to forget-me-nots.
Both the Greek Omphalodes (navel-like) and the English "navelwort" refer to the shape of the seeds.
O. verna and cultivars of O. cappadocica are grown in gardens for their blue flowers which in spring appear above the leaves in loose sprays. They are woodland plants, preferring some shade.

## Care Guide
Mexican Navelwort thrives in cool, shady locations with consistently moist, well-drained soil, much like its native understory habitat. Protect it from direct, harsh sun and ensure regular watering during its active growth, reducing frequency as temperatures rise in summer.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is generally sufficient, or none if planted in rich soil.
