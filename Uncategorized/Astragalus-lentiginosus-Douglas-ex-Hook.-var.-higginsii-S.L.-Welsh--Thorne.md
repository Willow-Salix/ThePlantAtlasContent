## Care Guide
Higgins' milkvetch thrives in full sun and requires very little water once established, perfectly suited to dry, arid conditions. It prefers well-draining, lean soil and generally does not need fertilization, reflecting its desert origins and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils and, as a legume, fixes its own nitrogen.
