## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (e.g., eastern USA, Canada) and Western & Central Europe (e.g., British Isles, France, Germany, Scandinavia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Wetlands (specifically acidic bogs, fens, and wet heathlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, as its native bog habitats are often open and exposed. |
| **Watering** | Constantly saturated or very wet soil conditions, mimicking its natural bog environment. Requires consistently high moisture. |

## Introduction
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## Care Guide
Brown Beaksedge thrives in constantly saturated, acidic conditions, typical of its native bog and fen habitats. Provide full to partial sun and maintain consistently wet soil, potentially in a bog garden. Avoid rich fertilizers as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils typical of bogs and fens.
