## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (California, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona) and Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed desert and chaparral environments. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking desert rainfall patterns. Highly drought-tolerant. |

## Introduction
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant annual thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its native arid scrubland and desert environments. Provide infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it prefers lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils typical of its native habitat. If needed, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once during the growing season might be applied for potted plants.
