## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Amazon Basin, encompassing regions of Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and the Guianas. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect light. Young plants thrive in dappled light, while mature trees can tolerate more direct sun if gradually acclimated. Avoid intense, prolonged direct afternoon sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture, reflecting its high-rainfall native environment. Water thoroughly when the top inch or two of soil feels dry, ensuring good drainage to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Do not let the soil dry out completely for extended periods. |

## Introduction
Hevea brasiliensis, the Pará rubber tree, sharinga tree, seringueira, or most commonly, rubber tree or rubber plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, originally native to the Amazon basin, but is now pantropical in distribution due to introductions. It is the most economically important member of the genus Hevea because the milky latex extracted from the tree is the primary source of natural rubber.

## Care Guide
To care for a Rubber Tree, provide bright, indirect light and maintain consistently moist, but not waterlogged, soil. Fertilize regularly during the warmer growing seasons, allowing the plant to rest in cooler months.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding during its active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength. Reduce or cease fertilization during fall and winter months.
