## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate hawthorn thrives in full sun to partial shade with moderate, consistent watering, particularly during establishment. It adapts well to various soil types and generally requires minimal fertilization, making it a robust and relatively low-maintenance plant once mature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adaptable to average soil fertility. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can benefit young plants or those in very poor soils, but often not strictly necessary for established plants.
