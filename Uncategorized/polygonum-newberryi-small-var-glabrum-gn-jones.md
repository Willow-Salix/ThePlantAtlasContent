## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada mountains, USA: California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Washington) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine to Alpine Tundra/Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun. This plant naturally grows in open, exposed areas above or near the treeline, requiring direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Its native habitat features well-drained, often rocky or volcanic soils with moisture from snowmelt and summer rains, but not constant saturation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine native thrives in full sun and requires exceptionally well-drained, even rocky, soil conditions. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and keep fertilization to a minimum as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, or volcanic soils common in its alpine environment. Minimal to no fertilization is typically needed; excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
