## Introduction
Chamaecrista is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Members of the genus are commonly known as sensitive pea. Several species are capable of rapid plant movement. Unlike the related genera Cassia and Senna, members of Chamaecrista form root nodules.
Chamaecrista has 367 species, with a wide distribution – the Americas from Minnesota to northern Argentina, sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Iran, the Indian Subcontinent, Indochina, China, Korea, Japan, Malesia, New Guinea, and Australia.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its arid native habitat. Provide infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization for best results.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; typically does not require regular fertilization. If grown in very poor soil, a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
