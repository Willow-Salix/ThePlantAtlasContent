## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America, including countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Costa Rica, and Panama. |
| **Climate** | Montane Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light. As epiphytes growing under a canopy in cloud forests, they should be protected from direct, harsh sun which can scorch their leaves. |
| **Watering** | Frequent watering is necessary due to their consistently moist native environment. Allow the potting medium to just approach dryness between waterings, but do not let it dry out completely. High humidity is crucial. |

## Introduction
Comparettia, abbreviated Comp in the horticultural trade, is a genus of orchids. It consists about 50-70 species, native to tropical America. They occur in Mexico, Central America, the West Indies, and in northern South America as far south as Brazil and Bolivia, although they are particularly common in the Andes. The genus has grown markedly in recent years due to many species being transferred from other genera.

## Care Guide
Comparettia orchids thrive when their native montane cloud forest conditions are replicated, requiring bright, indirect light and consistently high humidity. Water frequently, allowing slight drying between applications, and provide light, regular fertilization during active growth to encourage robust health and blooming.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is appropriate. Use a balanced orchid-specific fertilizer diluted to a quarter or half strength, applied every 2-4 waterings during active growth periods.
