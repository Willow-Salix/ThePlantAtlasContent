## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Utah, Nevada, Arizona, California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun, meaning at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to completely dry out between waterings. Overwatering is detrimental. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Gypsum Blazingstar prefers a high-exposure, full sun environment with well-draining, lean soils. Mimicking its arid native habitat, it requires infrequent watering and has very low fertilizer needs. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor, mineral soils, so avoid rich fertilizers. A very dilute, balanced feed once annually in spring, or none at all, is generally sufficient.
