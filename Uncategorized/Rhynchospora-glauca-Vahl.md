## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America (e.g., Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Trinidad and Tobago) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wetland / Tropical Savanna Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, thriving in open, unshaded marshy environments. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently saturated or with standing shallow water, replicating its boggy and marshy native habitat. |

## Introduction
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## Care Guide
This tropical wetland plant requires full sun to partial sun exposure and continuously wet to submerged soil conditions, replicating its native marshy environments in Central and South America. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to nutrient-scarce environments.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer; adapted to nutrient-poor wetland soils. A light, balanced liquid feed occasionally during the growing season is sufficient.
