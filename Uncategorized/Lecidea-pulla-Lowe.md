| **Native Origin** | Western Europe (especially Atlantic coasts), Macaronesia, parts of western North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Oceanic or Coastal Rocky Outcrops |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure, tolerant of direct sun but also found in partial shade on exposed rocks. |
| **Watering** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and occasional direct wetting (e.g., misting or rainfall). Allow to dry out completely between wetting cycles; avoid constant moisture. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in bright, airy environments with high humidity and periodic wetting. Ensure good air circulation and allow the lichen to dry thoroughly between misting or watering, mimicking its natural coastal or rocky outcrop habitat. No specific fertilizer is required.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Lichens derive nutrients from the atmosphere and their substrate.
