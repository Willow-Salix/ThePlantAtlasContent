## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in perpetually wet conditions, ideally in standing water or boggy areas, mimicking its native temperate wetland habitat. Provide partial to full sun for best flowering and ensure the soil never dries out. Fertilize lightly in spring if not in rich organic soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced slow-release fertilizer or organic matter can be incorporated in spring, especially if not in naturally rich wetland soil.
