## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Africa (widespread across much of the continent), Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia (e.g., India, Pakistan, China) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Dry Forest, Savanna, Mediterranean Climate, Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers full sun for optimal growth and fruit production, mimicking its open-canopy habitat in its native range. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods, but can withstand extended dry spells. Mimics the seasonal rainfall patterns of its native dry or Mediterranean climates. |

## Introduction
Olea ( OH-lee-ə) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Oleaceae. It includes 12 species native to warm temperate and tropical regions of the Middle East, southern Europe, Africa, southern Asia, and Australasia. They are evergreen trees and shrubs, with small, opposite, entire leaves. The fruit is a drupe. Leaves of Olea contain trichosclereids.
For humans, the most important and familiar species is by far the olive (Olea europaea), native to the Mediterranean region, Africa, southwest Asia, and the Himalayas, which is the type species of the genus. The native olive (O. paniculata) is a larger tree, attaining a height of 15–18 m in the forests of Queensland, and yielding a hard and tough timber. The yet harder wood of the black ironwood O. capensis, an inhabitant of Natal, is important in South Africa.
Olea species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including double-striped pug.

## Care Guide
The African Wild Olive thrives in full sun with well-draining soil and is highly drought-tolerant once established. It requires minimal watering and fertilization, reflecting its origins in dry subtropical and savanna environments. Protect from heavy frost if planted in colder zones.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; tolerant of poor, rocky soils. An annual application of a balanced fertilizer during the growing season is sufficient, as its native habitats often have less fertile soils.
