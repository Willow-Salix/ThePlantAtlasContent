| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical to Tropical Forest (often montane or cloud forest environments) |
| **Sunlight** | Very low, indirect light; avoid any direct sun exposure, mimicking its understory or epiphytic habitat. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture and very high ambient humidity. The substrate should remain damp but not waterlogged, and misting is highly beneficial. |

## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in conditions of constant high humidity and very low, indirect light, replicating its humid forest habitat. Maintain consistently moist substrate without waterlogging, and provide high ambient moisture through misting or a terrarium environment. Nutrient needs are extremely low.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; if used, apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/8th strength) very sparingly, once or twice a year.
