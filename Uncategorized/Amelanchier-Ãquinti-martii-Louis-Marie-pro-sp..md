## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (specifically Northeastern US and Eastern Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sun for best fruiting and flowering, but tolerates less) |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist soil, especially during dry periods and for newly planted specimens. Established plants are moderately drought-tolerant. |

## Introduction
Amelanchier ( am-ə-LAN-sheer), also known as shadbush, shadwood or shadblow, serviceberry or sarvisberry (or just sarvis), juneberry, saskatoon, sugarplum, wild-plum or chuckley pear, is a genus of about 20 species of deciduous-leaved shrubs and small trees in the rose family (Rosaceae).
Amelanchier is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, growing primarily in early successional habitats. It is most diverse taxonomically in North America, especially in the northeastern United States and adjacent southeastern Canada, and at least one species is native to every U.S. state except Hawaii and to every Canadian province and territory. Four species also occur in Asia, and two in Europe. 
A pome fruit, the berries are commonly consumed by wildlife and picked by humans for uses in baked goods. The Canadian city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan is named after a Cree term for the berry.

## Care Guide
This hybrid serviceberry thrives in conditions mimicking its native Eastern North American temperate forests. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure consistent moisture, especially during its establishment phase and dry spells. Fertilize lightly in spring for optimal growth and health.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, particularly in nutrient-poor soils.
