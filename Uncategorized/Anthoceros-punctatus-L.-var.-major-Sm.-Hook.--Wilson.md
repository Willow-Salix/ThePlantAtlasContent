## Care Guide
This hornwort thrives in consistently moist, highly humid environments with partial shade to indirect light. It requires stable dampness and does not tolerate drying out. Avoid direct sun and over-fertilization to ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low. Fertilization is generally not required; bryophytes like hornworts are sensitive to high nutrient levels and can be harmed by excessive fertilizer.
