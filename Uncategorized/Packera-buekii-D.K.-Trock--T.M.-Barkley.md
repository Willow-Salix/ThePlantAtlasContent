| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Idaho, Montana) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, thriving in open, exposed high-elevation environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent moisture during the growing season, but absolutely requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot, mimicking its native rocky habitats. |

## Introduction
Packera is a genus of about 75 species of plants in the daisy family, Asteraceae. Most species are commonly called ragworts or grounsels. Its members were previously included in the genus Senecio (where they were called aureoid senecios by Asa Gray), but were moved to genus Packera based on chromosome numbers, a variety of morphological characters, and molecular phylogenetic evidence.

## Care Guide
This high-altitude plant prefers cool temperatures, full to partial sun, and perfectly draining soil. Provide consistent moisture during active growth, but ensure conditions never become waterlogged to replicate its native subalpine and alpine meadow environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Excessive feeding can be detrimental.
