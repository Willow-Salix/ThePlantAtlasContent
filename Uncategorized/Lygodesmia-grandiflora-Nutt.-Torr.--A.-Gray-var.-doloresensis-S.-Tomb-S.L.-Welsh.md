## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern Colorado and Southeastern Utah, USA (Colorado Plateau) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low watering frequency; highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in cooler months. |

## Introduction
Lygodesmia, called skeletonplant, is a genus of North American flowering plants in the tribe Cichorieae within the family Asteraceae.
The name derives from the Greek lygos, a pliant twig, and desme, a bundle, because of the fascicled twiggy or rush-like stems of the plants.

## Care Guide
The Dolores River Skeletonplant requires full sun and infrequent watering, thriving in conditions that mimic its native arid scrubland environment. Ensure excellent drainage and provide minimal fertilizer, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and drought.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy or shaly soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very diluted desert plant formula during the active growing season.
