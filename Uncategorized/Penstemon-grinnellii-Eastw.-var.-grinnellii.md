## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern California, USA (specifically Transverse and Peninsular Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, thriving in open, exposed locations. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering once established; highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to rot in consistently wet conditions, especially during warm periods. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
Grinnell's Penstemon requires full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its native dry, rocky slopes in Southern California. Once established, water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed; thrives in lean, well-drained soils typical of its native habitat.
