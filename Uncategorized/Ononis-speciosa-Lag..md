## Introduction
Ononis is a genus of 80–90 species of perennial herbs and subshrubs in the legume family Fabaceae. The members of this genus are called restharrows; an old spelling "wrestharrows" is also recorded from 1965. as some species grow as weeds on arable lands where their tough roots would catch and stop the harrow. The genus is native to Europe, northern and eastern Africa, and western and central Asia.
In herbalism restharrow is used to treat bladder and kidney problems and water retention.
The active ingredients in restharrow are essential oils, flavonoid-glycosides, and tannins.
Restharrows are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the grey pug and Coleophora ononidella (which feeds exclusively on O. arvensis).

## Care Guide
Native to the sunny, dry Mediterranean climate of Southern Spain, Ononis speciosa thrives in full sun and is exceptionally drought-tolerant. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions, and apply fertilizer sparingly. This plant prefers well-drained soil typical of its native scrubland habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a light, balanced fertilizer application once a year in spring, or none if planted in rich soil.
