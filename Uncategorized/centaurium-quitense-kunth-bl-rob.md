## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Andes Mountains of South America, including Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Andean Montane Grassland / Páramo (Subalpine Grassland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to bright indirect light (at least 6 hours of direct sun daily is ideal). |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage, mimicking the frequent rainfall and mist of its native habitat. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely or becoming waterlogged. |

## 🌱 Overview
Centaurium (centaury) is a genus of 20 species in the gentian family (Gentianaceae), tribe Chironieae, subtribe Chironiinae. The genus was named after the centaur Chiron, famed in Greek mythology for his skill in medicinal herbs. It is distributed across Europe and Asia.
Until 2004, Centaurium was given a much wider circumscription, comprising about 50 species ranging across Europe, Asia, the Americas, Australasia, and the Pacific. However this circumscription was polyphyletic, so in 2004 the genus was split into four, being Centaurium sensu stricto, Zeltnera, Gyrandra, and Schenkia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This high-altitude plant thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil to replicate its native Andean páramo conditions. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to less nutrient-rich environments. Ensure good air circulation and avoid waterlogging to maintain optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder; use a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly during the growing season (e.g., once a month) or incorporate a slow-release granular fertilizer at planting. Avoid over-fertilization.
