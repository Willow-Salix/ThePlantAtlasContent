## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic regions, high mountain ranges of Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia), North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains), and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect to direct light. Tolerates full sun in cool temperatures, mimicking its exposed rocky habitats above the tree line. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist, mimicking snowmelt and frequent precipitation, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Benefits from high ambient humidity. |

## 🌱 Overview
Andreaea is a genus of rock mosses described by Johann Hedwig in 1801.
They are small, delicate acrocarpous mosses (meaning that the capsules are formed at the tips of vertical branches) that form dark brown or reddish cushions on wet siliceous rocks in mountainous areas. The capsule lacks the peristome teeth and operculum of other mosses, and opens by splitting along 4 vertical slits, the four valves remaining joined at the base and apex. The capsule of Andreaea has no seta, but the sporophyte (Spf in the diagram below) instead is supported by a pseudopodium (ps) derived from gametophyte tissue, as in Sphagnum and the columella is enclosed within the sporangium. The spores germinate to give thalloid protonemata.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine moss requires cool temperatures, bright light, and consistent moisture with superb drainage. Mimicking its native rocky, high-altitude habitat, it thrives in high humidity and nutrient-poor conditions, making over-fertilization detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in nutrient-poor environments, so fertilization is rarely needed or should be extremely diluted and infrequent.
