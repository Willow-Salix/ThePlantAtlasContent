# Costa Rican Moss

*Atractylocarpus costaricensis (MÃ¼ll. Hal.) R.S. Williams* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Costa Rica, Central and South America (montane regions) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Rainforest (Cloud Forest) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate, indirect light. Thrives in filtered sunlight or partial to deep shade. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist substrate and high humidity are essential. Water frequently to keep the growing medium damp but not waterlogged, and consider regular misting. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in a high-humidity environment with consistent moisture and low, indirect light, mimicking its native montane rainforest habitat. Provide a damp, well-draining substrate and protect from direct sun to ensure optimal growth and prevent drying out.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs. If desired, apply a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very infrequently, or rely on nutrients from water and decaying organic matter.
