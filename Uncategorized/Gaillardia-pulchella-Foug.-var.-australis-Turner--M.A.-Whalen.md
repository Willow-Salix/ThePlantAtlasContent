## Care Guide
Indian Blanket is a resilient wildflower that thrives with minimal care, preferring full sun and well-draining, poor to average soil. Once established, it is extremely drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, mirroring its native prairie habitat. Avoid over-fertilizing to ensure abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Very low; thrives in poor to average soils. Fertilization is generally not required and can even reduce flowering. Its native environments are not typically nutrient-rich.
