# Western Spurge
### *Grammica occidentalis (Millsp.) Hadac & Chrtek*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Baja California Peninsula (Mexico), southwestern Arizona (USA), and southern California (USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring several hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Sensitive to overwatering. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, preferring long dry periods between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to root rot from overwatering, thus needing well-draining soil and infrequent fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Desert soils are typically poor, so a very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly, if at all, during the active growing season.
