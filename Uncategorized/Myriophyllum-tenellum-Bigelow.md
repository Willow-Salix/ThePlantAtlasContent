## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (USA: Northeast, Great Lakes states; Canada: eastern provinces) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Freshwater Aquatic (found in shallow, often acidic waters like bogs, fens, and ponds) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; accustomed to bright, direct light found in open water bodies. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant submersion in fresh, still to slow-moving water; it is an aquatic plant and cannot tolerate drying out. |

## Introduction
Myriophyllum (water milfoil) is a genus of about 69 species of freshwater aquatic plants, with a cosmopolitan distribution. The centre of diversity for Myriophyllum is Australia with 43 recognized species (37 endemic).
These submersed aquatic plants are perhaps most commonly recognized for having elongate stems with air canals and whorled leaves that are finely, pinnately divided, but there are many exceptions. For example, the North American species M. tenellum has alternately arranged scale-like leaves, while many Australian species have small alternate or opposite leaves that lack dissection. The plants are usually heterophyllous; leaves above the water are often stiffer and smaller than the submerged leaves on the same plant and can lack dissection. Species can be monoecious or dioecious. In monoecious species, plants are hermaphrodite, while in dioecious species, plants are either male or female, the flowers are small, 4(2)-parted and usually borne in emergent leaf axils. The 'female' flowers usually lack petals. The fruit is a schizocarp that splits into four (two) nutlets at maturity.
The fruits and leaves can be an important food source for waterfowl, which are thought to be important for seed and clonal dispersal.

## Care Guide
Slender Watermilfoil thrives when fully submerged in clean, fresh water under full sun to partial shade. Provide moderate aquatic nutrient levels, ensuring consistent water quality to support its delicate growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate nutrient levels; can absorb nutrients from the water column or from a nutrient-rich aquatic substrate. Over-fertilization can lead to algae growth.
