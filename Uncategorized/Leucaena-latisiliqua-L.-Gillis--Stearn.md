## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Mexico and northern Central America (e.g., Guatemala, Belize) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest to Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) reflecting its open habitat in native regions. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water regularly during the growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry between waterings, and reduce frequency during dry or dormant periods to mimic its native wet/dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Leucaena leucocephala is a small fast-growing mimosoid tree native to southern Mexico and northern Central America (Belize and Guatemala). It is now naturalized throughout the tropics including parts of Asia.
Common names include white leadtree, white popinac, horse tamarind, ipil-ipil, koa haole, and tan-tan.
Leucaena leucocephala is used for a variety of purposes, such as fencing, soil fertility, firewood, fiber, and livestock fodder.

## Care Guide
White Leadtree thrives in full sun, characteristic of its native tropical dry forest and savanna habitats. It is drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular watering during its growing season, mimicking its natural wet/dry cycles. Being a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enhances soil fertility and generally requires minimal external fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly if needed.
