## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia.

## Care Guide
Sticky Goldenrod thrives in full to partial sun, typical of its native temperate montane and subalpine habitats. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and performs best in average to poor soils with little to no fertilizer. This makes it a low-maintenance and robust plant choice.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. This plant thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilizer.
