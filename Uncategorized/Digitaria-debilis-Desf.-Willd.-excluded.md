## Introduction
Digitaria is a genus of plants in the grass family native to tropical and warm temperate regions but can occur in tropical, subtropical, and cooler temperate regions as well. Common names include crabgrass, finger-grass, and fonio. They are slender monocotyledonous annual and perennial lawn, pasture, and forage plants; some are often considered lawn pests. Digitus is the Latin word for "finger", and they are distinguished by the long, finger-like inflorescences they produce.

## Care Guide
This adaptable grass thrives in full sun and warm conditions, preferring regular moisture for vigorous growth while tolerating some drought. Provide moderate fertilization during its active growing periods to support its health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer) is sufficient.
