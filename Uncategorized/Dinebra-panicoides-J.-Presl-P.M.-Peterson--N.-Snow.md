## Care Guide
Dinebra panicoides thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. It is well-suited to conditions mimicking its native tropical and subtropical grasslands, tolerating some drought. Fertilization should be light, primarily during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer once or twice during its active growing season, consistent with typical grassland soil fertility.
