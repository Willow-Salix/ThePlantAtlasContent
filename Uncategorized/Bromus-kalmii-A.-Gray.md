## Introduction
Bromus is a large genus of grasses, classified in its own tribe Bromeae. They are commonly known as bromes, brome grasses, cheat grasses, or chess grasses. Estimates in the scientific literature of the number of species have ranged from 100 to 400, but plant taxonomists currently recognize around 160–170 species.
Bromus is part of the cool-season grass lineage (subfamily Pooideae), which includes about 3300 species.  Within Pooideae, Bromus is classified in tribe Bromeae (it is the only genus in the tribe).  Bromus is closely related to the wheat-grass lineage (tribe Triticeae) that includes such economically important genera as Triticum (wheat), Hordeum (barley) and Secale (rye).

## Care Guide
Kalm's Brome thrives in temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade in well-drained soils. It requires moderate watering to maintain consistent moisture, reflecting its native habitat in North American prairies and woodland edges.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Benefits from average soil fertility, potentially needing a light application of balanced fertilizer in nutrient-poor soils.
