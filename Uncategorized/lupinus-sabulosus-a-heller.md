## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soil, tolerating dry conditions once established. Avoid overwatering and excessive nitrogen fertilizer to ensure healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, especially nitrogen, as lupines are legumes and fix their own nitrogen. Sandy soils in their native habitat are typically low in nutrients.
