## Introduction
Bromus is a large genus of grasses, classified in its own tribe Bromeae. They are commonly known as bromes, brome grasses, cheat grasses, or chess grasses. Estimates in the scientific literature of the number of species have ranged from 100 to 400, but plant taxonomists currently recognize around 160–170 species.
Bromus is part of the cool-season grass lineage (subfamily Pooideae), which includes about 3300 species.  Within Pooideae, Bromus is classified in tribe Bromeae (it is the only genus in the tribe).  Bromus is closely related to the wheat-grass lineage (tribe Triticeae) that includes such economically important genera as Triticum (wheat), Hordeum (barley) and Secale (rye).

## Care Guide
Porter brome is a robust grass best suited for full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native habitat in open grasslands and woodlands. It requires moderate watering with periods of dryness between applications and has low fertilizer needs, thriving in average soil conditions. This plant is well-adapted to temperate climates with distinct seasons.

### Fertilizer
Low; a light, balanced fertilizer applied once in spring is sufficient if growth is desired, otherwise generally not required as it thrives in average to poor soils.
