## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern California and southwestern Oregon, United States |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically, redwood forests and mixed evergreen forests) |
| **Sunlight** | Part-shade to full shade; protection from direct afternoon sun is crucial, as it naturally grows under a dense forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, but well-draining, soil during its active growing season in spring. Reduce watering significantly as the plant enters dormancy in late summer or fall. |

## Introduction
Trillium (trillium, wakerobin, toadshade, tri flower, birthroot, birthwort, and sometimes "wood lily") is a genus of about fifty flowering plant species in the family Melanthiaceae. Trillium species are native to temperate regions of North America and Asia, with the greatest diversity of species found in the southern Appalachian Mountains in the southeastern United States.

## Care Guide
This woodland perennial needs a cool, shady location with rich, consistently moist, and well-draining soil to mimic its native forest floor habitat. Protect it from intense sunlight and allow for a natural summer dormancy with reduced watering.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in naturally rich, humus-filled soil. Amend annually with leaf mold or compost; a light application of a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer in early spring is beneficial.
