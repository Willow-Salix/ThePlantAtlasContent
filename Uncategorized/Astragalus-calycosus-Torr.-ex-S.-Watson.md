## Care Guide
Torrey's Milkvetch is a highly drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soil, reflecting its native arid scrubland habitat. Water sparingly, allowing soil to fully dry between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, and its native soils are typically lean and rocky. Over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen, should be avoided.
