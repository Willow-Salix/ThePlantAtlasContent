## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Alpine and boreal regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, North America, and Asia, typically on siliceous rocks. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Boreal Forest (rocky outcrops within these biomes) |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. While often found in exposed areas, protection from intense, prolonged direct sunlight is beneficial to prevent desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | As a lichen, it absorbs moisture from the air, dew, and rain. Provide high ambient humidity or regular misting. It tolerates dry periods but needs to rehydrate, so avoid 'watering' like a soil plant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lecidea olivacea thrives in cool, bright, and humid conditions, reflecting its alpine and boreal origins. Provide bright, indirect light and ensure high ambient humidity through regular misting to facilitate moisture absorption. Avoid direct watering or traditional fertilizers, as it naturally derives nutrients and moisture from the environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere, rainfall, and the substrate they grow on.
