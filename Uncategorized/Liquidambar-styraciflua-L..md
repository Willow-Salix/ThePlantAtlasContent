## Care Guide
Sweetgum thrives in full sun and prefers consistently moist, well-draining, fertile soil, especially when young. Once established, it becomes quite adaptable to various conditions, including some drought. Provide ample space for its mature size and root system.

### Fertilizer
Prefers fertile, acidic to neutral soil. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially when young or in poor soil.
