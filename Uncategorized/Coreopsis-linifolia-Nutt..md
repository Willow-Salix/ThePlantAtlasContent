## Care Guide
Texas Tickseed prefers full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native prairie environment. It is quite drought-tolerant once established, needing only moderate watering during dry spells. Fertilization is rarely necessary, as it thrives in less nutrient-rich conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically requires minimal to no fertilization, as it is adapted to average to poor soils found in its native prairie habitat.
