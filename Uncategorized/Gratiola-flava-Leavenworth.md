## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, the Carolinas) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Wetlands, Bogs, Marshes) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, as it naturally occurs in open, exposed wet habitats. |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to moist soil is critical; it thrives in constantly damp conditions and can tolerate shallow standing water, mirroring its native boggy environment. |

## Care Guide
Yellow Hedgehyssop thrives in full sun and demands consistently wet to moist soil conditions, emulating its native bog and marsh habitats in the southeastern US. Provide moderate fertilization during its active growth period to support healthy foliage and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization; a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied monthly during the growing season to support robust growth in its naturally nutrient-rich, organic wetland soils.
