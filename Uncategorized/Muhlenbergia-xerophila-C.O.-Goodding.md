| **Watering** | Very low; allow soil to dry out completely between infrequent waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant in its native dry habitat. |

## Introduction

The genus is named in honor of the German-American amateur botanist Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg (1753-1815). Many of the species are known by the common name muhly.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant grass thrives in full sun and very dry conditions, mirroring its native arid grasslands habitat. Provide minimal water, allowing the soil to dry out completely between irrigations, and avoid over-fertilizing as it prefers lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean, rocky, or sandy soils typical of its native range and does not require frequent fertilization.
