## Introduction
Hesperochiron is a small genus of plants in the waterleaf family containing two species native to western North America. These are thick-rooted perennial herbs growing in squat patches at ground level and producing bluish-white flowers with yellow throats. They grow in wet areas such as seepy meadows.
The species are generally similar in appearance, with oblong green leaves up to 7 or 8 centimeters long and 2 to 3 wide, often coated with tiny hairs. Hesperochiron californicus, the California hesperochiron, produces slightly larger flowers than the dwarf hesperochiron, Hesperochiron pumilus.
The H. pumilus flower resembles wild strawberry, but has only five stamens and distinct elliptical leaves. They bloom briefly in early spring in the sagebrush steppe.

## Care Guide
This plant flourishes in consistently moist conditions, mirroring its native habitat in temperate montane meadows and along stream banks. Provide full sun to partial shade, ensuring some protection from intense afternoon heat. Fertilize moderately in spring to encourage robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied lightly in early spring, but it thrives in naturally fertile meadow soils without excessive feeding.
