## Introduction
Gentiana () is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the gentian family (Gentianaceae), the tribe Gentianeae, and the monophyletic subtribe Gentianinae. With over 300 species, it is considered a large genus. Gentians are notable for their mostly large trumpet-shaped flowers, which are often of an intense blue hue, though some are also bright yellow. The type species of the genus is Gentiana lutea.
The genus name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king who may have discovered tonic properties in gentians.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in cool temperatures and bright light, preferring locations that mimic its native high-altitude environment. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and does not tolerate hot, humid conditions or excessive fertilization. Ensure good air circulation and protection from intense afternoon sun in warmer zones.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly during the growing season or none if soil is already sufficiently fertile. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
