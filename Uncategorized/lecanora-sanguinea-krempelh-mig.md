## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia (e.g., Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand), South Asia (e.g., India, Sri Lanka), and parts of the Neotropics. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forest, Subtropical Montane Forest. |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect light, dappled shade, or partial shade. It requires protection from intense, direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | As a lichen, it absorbs moisture from the air and rain. It requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and regular moisture, typically from misting or ambient humidity, rather than direct watering. Good air circulation is essential. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lecanora sanguinea, a lichen, thrives in high humidity and indirect to partial shade, mimicking its native tropical and subtropical forest habitats. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture for hydration but no direct watering or fertilization, as it absorbs nutrients from its environment. Maintaining good air circulation is crucial to its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer is required or recommended. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from the air (dust, rain) and their substrate. Fertilization can be detrimental.
