## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |

| **Climate** | Montane/Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. Thrives in exposed, high-light conditions typical of mountain slopes. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to infrequent. Adapted to periods of moisture from snowmelt and rain, followed by drier conditions. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic its well-drained, rocky habitat. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Toiyabe Springparsley thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, replicating its native montane environment. Water moderately during its active growing season, ensuring the soil dries completely between sessions, and apply fertilizer very sparingly.

### Fertilizer
Low. Native to nutrient-poor, rocky mountain soils, it does not require rich fertilization and may be harmed by excessive nutrients.
