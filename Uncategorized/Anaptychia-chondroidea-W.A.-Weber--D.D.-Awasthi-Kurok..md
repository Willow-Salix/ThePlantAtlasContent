## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Himalayas (Nepal, India - Darjeeling region) |
| **Climate** | Montane Moist Broadleaf Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Filtered light to partial shade, protected from direct, intense sunlight, mimicking a forest understory or frequent cloud cover. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity and frequent access to moisture from rain or mist; requires good air circulation to prevent fungal growth. Does not require soil watering. |

## Introduction
Anaptychia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. Anaptychia species are foliose (leafy) to fruticose (bushy) lichens. They have brown, thin-walled spores with a single septum, and a prosoplechtenchymatous upper cortex.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, highly humid environments with filtered light, mimicking its native montane moist forest habitat. It obtains all necessary moisture from ambient humidity and rain, requiring no traditional watering or soil. Avoid direct sun and conventional fertilizers, ensuring good air circulation.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens absorb all necessary nutrients directly from the atmosphere and substrate and do not benefit from conventional fertilizers.
