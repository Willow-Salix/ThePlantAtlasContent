## Introduction
Crassula is a genus of succulent plants containing about 200 accepted species, including the popular jade plant (Crassula ovata). They are members of the stonecrop family (Crassulaceae) and are native to many parts of the globe, but cultivated varieties originate almost exclusively from species from the Eastern Cape of South Africa.
Crassulas are usually propagated by stem or leaf cuttings. Most cultivated forms will tolerate some small degree of frost, but extremes of cold or heat will cause them to lose foliage and die.

## Care Guide
Provide this annual plant with full sun to partial shade and ensure consistent moisture during its short, active growing season. It thrives in poor soils, so fertilizer is generally unnecessary. Allow the substrate to dry out somewhat as the plant naturally declines after flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; it is adapted to nutrient-poor or disturbed soils and excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
