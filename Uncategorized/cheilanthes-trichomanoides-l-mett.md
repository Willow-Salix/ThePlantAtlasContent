## 🌱 Overview
Cheilanthes, commonly known as lip ferns, is a genus of about 180 species of rock-dwelling ferns with a cosmopolitan distribution in warm, dry, rocky regions, often growing in small crevices high up on cliffs.  Most are small, sturdy and evergreen.   The leaves, often densely covered in trichomes, spring directly from the rootstocks.  Many of them are desert ferns, curling up during dry times and reviving with the coming of moisture.  At the ends of veins sporangia, or spore-bearing structures, are protected by leaf margins, which curl over them.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant fern thrives in bright indirect light to partial shade, mimicking its native rocky, dry tropical habitats. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and provide minimal fertilizer only during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very light fertilization, typically a diluted balanced liquid fertilizer applied once or twice during the growing season (spring/summer).
