## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Carex festivella thrives in cool, moist to wet environments, mirroring its native subalpine meadows and streambanks. Ensure consistently wet soil and provide full sun to partial shade, adjusting sun exposure based on the intensity of your local climate. This sedge is not a heavy feeder and generally requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula once in spring is generally sufficient, or none if grown in naturally fertile soil.
