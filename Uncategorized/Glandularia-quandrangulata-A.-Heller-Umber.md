## Introduction
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## Care Guide
Beaked Mock Vervain thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering with thorough drying between sessions. Adapted to lean soils, it needs minimal to no fertilization. This plant is best suited for dry, sunny garden spots.

### Fertilizer
Low nutrient requirements. Fertilization is generally not necessary, or very minimal (e.g., a very dilute balanced fertilizer once a year) in poor soils.
