## Care Guide
Tall Oatgrass is a hardy grass that flourishes in full sun and well-drained, moderately fertile soil. It benefits from regular watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and is tolerant of drought once mature. It has low fertilizer needs, thriving in average soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average soil fertility; excessive fertilization can lead to weak growth. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth appears poor.
