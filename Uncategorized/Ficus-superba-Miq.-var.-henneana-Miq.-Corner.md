## Introduction
Ficus henneana is a strangler fig only occurring in Australia. Previously considered a variety of Ficus superba which occurs in China, Japan and parts of South East Asia. The cedar fig or deciduous fig grows in Australia from Milton, New South Wales to northern Queensland and the Northern Territory. The habitat is riverine, littoral or the drier forms of rainforest.

## Care Guide
This fig prefers bright light, even full sun, mimicking its native open forest and margin habitats. Water consistently during growth, letting the soil dry slightly, and feed regularly. Expect seasonal leaf drop in cooler or drier conditions.

### Fertilizer
Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer) to support robust growth.
