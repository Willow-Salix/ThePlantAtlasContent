## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western Australia (endemic to the Wheatbelt region, particularly around Wongan Hills) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Woodland/Mallee (characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is preferred due to its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering when young to establish a robust root system. Once mature, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, especially during dry summer periods. |

## Introduction
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## Care Guide
The Wongan Hills Mallee, native to Western Australia's Mediterranean climate, thrives in full sun with excellent drainage. Water regularly when young, then allow it to become drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize sparingly with a low-phosphorus formula, as it prefers poorer soils and can be sensitive to excess nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Low. Eucalypts are generally adapted to nutrient-poor soils and are sensitive to high phosphorus levels. Use a low-phosphorus, slow-release native plant fertilizer sparingly, primarily during establishment or if deficiency symptoms are apparent. Avoid rich, heavily fertilized soils.
