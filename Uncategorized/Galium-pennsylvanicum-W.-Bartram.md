| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade, especially protected from intense afternoon sun, mimicking its growth under a forest canopy. |

## Introduction
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## Care Guide
Pennsylvania Bedstraw thrives in partial to full shade, mimicking its native temperate forest understory. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Provide regular watering and a light annual feeding with compost for best results.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from soil rich in organic matter. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is generally sufficient.
