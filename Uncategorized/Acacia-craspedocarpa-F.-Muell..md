## Introduction
Acacia, commonly known as wattles or acacias, is a genus of about 1,084 species of shrubs and trees in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the pea family Fabaceae. Initially, it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa, South America, and Australasia, but is now reserved for species mainly from Australia, with others from New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. The genus name is Neo-Latin, borrowed from Koine Greek ἀκακία (akakia), a term used in antiquity to describe a preparation extracted from Vachellia nilotica, the original type species.
Several species of Acacia have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established.

## Care Guide
This resilient acacia thrives in full sun and very well-draining, even nutrient-poor, soils, reflecting its arid native habitat. Water sparingly, ensuring the soil dries out completely between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization to promote healthy growth. It is an excellent choice for xeriscaping or gardens in dry climates.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
