## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South-central United States (e.g., Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas) and northern Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Wetland/Aquatic (found in ephemeral pools, ditches, and shallow water bodies) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. In its natural habitat, it often grows in open, exposed shallow waters. |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to submerged. Requires its roots to be in water or very saturated soil at all times. Tolerates periods where water recedes, leaving the soil merely moist. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Marsilea tenuifolia is an aquatic fern that thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently wet to submerged conditions, mimicking its native habitat in shallow, often temporary, bodies of water. Provide occasional fertilization to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from occasional liquid fertilizer, especially if grown in containers or nutrient-poor substrates. Natural wetland environments can be rich in organic matter.
