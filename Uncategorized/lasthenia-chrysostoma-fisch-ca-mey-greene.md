## 🧤 Care Instructions
Goldfields is an annual wildflower native to California's Mediterranean climate, thriving in full sun. It needs consistent moisture during its winter-spring growth cycle and prefers average to poor soil without heavy fertilization. This plant completes its life cycle before the onset of summer drought.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a native wildflower, it thrives in average to poor soils and does not require rich nutrients or heavy fertilization. Excessive fertilizer can sometimes lead to lush foliage at the expense of flowers.
