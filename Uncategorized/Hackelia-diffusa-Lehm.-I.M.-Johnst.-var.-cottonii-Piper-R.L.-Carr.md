## Introduction
Hackelia (stickseeds) is a genus of plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. It includes 54 species found in North America, western South America, temperate Eurasia, and Australia. 12 species are native to California.
The genus was named after Josef Hackel, a Czech botanist. The common name, stickseed, refers to the tendency of the barbed nutlets to stick to animal fur.

## Care Guide
Cotton's Stickseed thrives in conditions mimicking its native dry, open woodlands of the Pacific Northwest. It requires full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, tolerating periods of drought once established. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum as it prefers lean soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal; thrives in lean, well-drained soil and does not require rich fertilization.
