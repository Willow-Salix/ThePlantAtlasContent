## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate and boreal regions across North America, Europe, and parts of Oceania, often found in countries like Ireland, UK, Scandinavia, USA, Canada, and New Zealand. |
| **Climate** | Alpine, Subalpine, and Montane Temperate to Boreal zones, characterized by exposed rock environments. |
| **Sunlight** | High light, often full sun exposure, as it naturally grows on open, exposed rock surfaces. |
| **Watering** | No traditional watering is required; this lichen relies entirely on natural atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, fog). It tolerates periods of desiccation and rehydrates quickly. Requires excellent air circulation. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
Lecidea crenata is a crustose lichen thriving on exposed siliceous rocks in temperate to boreal montane environments. Its care requires high light, excellent air circulation, and natural atmospheric moisture cycles, rendering traditional watering and fertilization unsuitable and potentially harmful. The overall strategy focuses on mimicking its harsh, exposed, naturally fluctuating environment.

### Fertilizer
Does not require soil-based fertilizers. It obtains trace nutrients from the atmosphere and its rock substrate; sensitive to excessive nutrient levels.
