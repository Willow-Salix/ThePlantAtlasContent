## Care Guide
Mexican Panicgrass flourishes in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native semi-arid grasslands. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. This plant is well-suited for xeriscaping or areas with infrequent watering.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to less fertile soils. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is generally sufficient.
