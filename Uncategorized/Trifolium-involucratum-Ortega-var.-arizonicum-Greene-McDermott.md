## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas) |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid to sub-humid grasslands and open woodlands, with seasonal moisture variations (e.g., summer monsoons) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, typically thriving in open, exposed areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between applications. It benefits from more consistent moisture during active growth periods and can tolerate some drought once established. |

## Introduction
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## Care Guide
Arizona Clover thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between applications. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has low fertilizer needs, particularly for nitrogen, and can contribute to soil health.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements, especially for nitrogen, as it is a nitrogen-fixing legume. A general all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly if soil fertility is poor or growth is lacking.
