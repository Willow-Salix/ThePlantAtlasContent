## Care Guide
Ground Nama thrives in conditions similar to its native arid scrubland. Provide full sun exposure and ensure very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to fully dry out between sessions. This drought-tolerant plant requires very little fertilization and prefers poor, well-draining soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Minimal fertilization, if any, is required, perhaps a very diluted feed once a year.
