## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Florida, USA |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, ideally receiving at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the soil to largely dry out between waterings. Increase frequency during hot, dry growing seasons and reduce during cooler, dormant periods to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Asimina is a genus of small trees or shrubs described as a genus in 1763. Asimina is the only temperate genus in the tropical and subtropical flowering plant family Annonaceae. Asimina have large, simple leaves and large fruit. It is native to eastern North America and collectively referred to as pawpaw. The genus includes the widespread common pawpaw Asimina triloba, which bears the largest edible fruit indigenous to the United States. Pawpaws are native to 26 states of the U.S. and to Ontario in Canada. The common pawpaw is a patch-forming (clonal) understory tree found in well-drained, deep, fertile bottomland and hilly upland habitat. Pawpaws are in the same plant family (Annonaceae) as the custard apple, cherimoya, sweetsop, soursop, and ylang-ylang;  the genus is the only member of that family not confined to the tropics. Fossils date to the Cretaceous.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, mimicking its native Florida scrubland habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and fertilize lightly during its active growth period to support its modest nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient. Use a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring, or a half-strength liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season. Avoid heavy feeding as native soils are often nutrient-poor.
