## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bog Sedges (Kobresia) require a cool, moist environment with ample sunlight, characteristic of their native alpine and subalpine habitats. Keep the soil consistently wet, ideally mimicking bog-like conditions, and provide full to partial sun. Due to their adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, fertilizing should be very minimal or avoided.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, often acidic soils. Minimal or no fertilization is typically needed; excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
