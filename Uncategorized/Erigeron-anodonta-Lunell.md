## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native prairie environment. Water moderately, ensuring the soil dries between applications, as it is quite drought-tolerant once established. It requires minimal fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low. Requires minimal fertilization as prairie plants are adapted to average to lean soil conditions. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring might be beneficial if growth is poor.
