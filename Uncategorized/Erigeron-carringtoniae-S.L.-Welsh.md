## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (specifically Nevada, Utah, and Arizona) |
| **Climate** | Arid Montane / Subalpine (often rocky slopes and pinyon-juniper woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in high light exposure typical of mountain slopes. |
| **Watering** | Very low; drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking dry mountain conditions. |

## Introduction
Erigeron () is a large genus of plants in the composite family (Asteraceae). It is placed in the tribe Astereae and is closely related to the Old World asters (Aster) and the true daisies (Bellis). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and the highest diversity occurs in North America.

## Care Guide
This high-desert native requires abundant sunlight and very little water, thriving in conditions that mimic its arid montane home. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid over-fertilizing to maintain its health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Native to nutrient-poor, rocky, often limestone soils, so rich fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
