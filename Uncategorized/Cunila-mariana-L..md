## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central United States (from New York south to Florida and west to Texas and Kansas) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest / Prairie (often found in dry open woodlands and prairies) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in environments with ample light but can tolerate some filtered shade, mimicking its native habitat at the edge of woodlands or in open prairies. |
| **Watering** | Average, allowing the topsoil to dry out completely between waterings. It is accustomed to periods of dryness typical in its native 'dry open woods' habitat, indicating good drought tolerance once established. |

## Care Guide
American Dittany is a resilient perennial best suited for full sun to partial shade, thriving in well-drained soil. It's notably drought-tolerant once established, requiring average watering but tolerating dry spells. Fertilization needs are minimal, aligning with its natural growth in lean woodland and prairie soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. It naturally grows in lean to average soils, so excessive fertilization is not required and can be detrimental. A light application of compost can suffice if soil nutrients are poor.
