## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical Asia, Pacific Islands (e.g., Fiji, Samoa), Australia (Queensland), New Zealand |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest, Wet Subtropical Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade; thrives in indirect, dappled light. Direct harsh sunlight will scorch its fronds. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. High humidity is crucial, requiring frequent misting or placement in a humid environment. |

## Introduction
Microsorum is a genus of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae, subfamily Microsoroideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). The species are tropical.  Like most ferns, they grow from rhizomes, rather than roots. The genus name is often misspelled "Microsorium" or "Microsoreum" .  It includes some species that are lithophytic rheophytes.

## Care Guide
The Musk Fern requires consistent moisture, high humidity, and indirect light to mimic its native tropical rainforest habitat. Provide light fertilization during the warmer months, ensuring the soil remains moist but never waterlogged.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a diluted liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring/summer). As an epiphyte/lithophyte, it naturally draws nutrients from decaying matter and does not require heavy fertilization.
