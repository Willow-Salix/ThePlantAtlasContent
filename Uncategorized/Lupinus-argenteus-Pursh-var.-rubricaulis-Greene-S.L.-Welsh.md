## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
This variety of Silver Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its native montane grassland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry periods. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires minimal to no fertilizer and should avoid high-nitrogen feeds.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers as lupines are nitrogen-fixing plants and prefer lean soil.
