## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (Canada: Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario; USA: Maine south to Florida, and west to Mississippi and Arkansas) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Wetlands and Moist Pine Barrens |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light, mimicking its understory habitat beneath conifers or in open bog areas with diffused light. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil, never allowing it to dry out. Requires very high atmospheric humidity to thrive. |

## Introduction
Schizaea is a small genus of specialized ferns in the family Schizaeaceae.  Common names include curlygrass fern and comb fern. Some species are very small and inconspicuous, and so may often be overlooked in nature. The genus is distinctive and not at all like the common conception of a fern, though it is still considered a true fern (leptosporangiate). The sterile fronds (trophophylls) are grass-like, and the spore-bearing fertile frond (sporophyll) is similar, but with a small, pinnate fertile segment at its apex. The upper surface of the pinnules bear the sessile capsules. 
Various of the roughly two dozen species have been reported from widely separated regions, including much of the tropical Old and New World, parts of the Eastern USA, Chile, the Falkland Islands, and various Pacific islands, including several islands of New Caledonia, as well as Australia and New Zealand. In Africa at least two species are endemic to South Africa.

## Care Guide
This rare fern demands consistently moist, acidic soil and high humidity, mirroring its native bog and wet pine barren habitats. Provide low to medium indirect light and very minimal, infrequent fertilization to best replicate its natural growing conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. Benefits from very dilute, infrequent fertilization, preferably with an acidic-loving formulation, due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor, acidic soils.
