## Introduction
Helianthemum (), known as rock rose, sunrose, rushrose, or frostweed, is a genus of about 110 species of flowering plants in the family Cistaceae. They are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, especially in the Mediterranean.
New World species formerly classified as Helianthemum have been transferred to genus Crocanthemum.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and dry, sandy conditions, reflecting its native habitat in temperate sandy barrens. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny spots.

### Fertilizer
Very low; adapted to poor, nutrient-deficient sandy soils. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
