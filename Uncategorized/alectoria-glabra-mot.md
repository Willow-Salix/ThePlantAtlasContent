# Alectoria Glabra Mot.
### *Alectoria glabra Mot.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Boreal and subalpine forests of the Northern Hemisphere, including regions in North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Alaska, Canada), Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, mountainous areas), and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Boreal Forest (Taiga) and Subalpine zones, characterized by cool to cold temperatures, high atmospheric humidity, and frequent precipitation (rain, snow, fog, mist). |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires filtered light, partial shade, or dappled sunlight, mimicking its growth under a dense forest canopy. Direct, intense sunlight should be avoided, especially when coupled with low humidity, as it can cause desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Demands consistent high atmospheric humidity and regular moisture from mist or precipitation. It absorbs water directly from the air and surfaces, not requiring traditional watering methods. Good air circulation is crucial to allow periodic drying and prevent fungal issues. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Alectoria glabra Mot. thrives in cool, humid environments with filtered light and excellent air circulation, mimicking its native boreal and subalpine forest habitats. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture from mist or rain but is highly sensitive to direct watering, fertilizers, and pollutants. Maintain a stable, cool, and moist environment, allowing periods of drying to prevent fungal issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Highly sensitive to pollutants and excess nutrients. Does not require traditional fertilization and can be harmed by it. It absorbs trace nutrients from clean rain and air.
