## Care Guide
Thriving as a groundcover in its native tropical rainforest, the Silver Inch Plant prefers bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It benefits from moderate fertilization during the growing season, mimicking the nutrient availability of its natural habitat, to support its lush, colorful foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer) using a balanced liquid fertilizer.
