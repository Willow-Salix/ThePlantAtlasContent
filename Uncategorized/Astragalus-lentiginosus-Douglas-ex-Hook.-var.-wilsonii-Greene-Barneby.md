## Care Guide
Wilson's milkvetch, adapted to arid scrublands and high deserts, requires full sun and very infrequent, deep watering. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs minimal to no fertilization, benefiting from its natural nitrogen-fixing capabilities and preference for lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; as a legume (Fabaceae family), it fixes nitrogen and is adapted to lean, poor soils common in arid regions.
