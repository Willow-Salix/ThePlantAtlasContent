## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native arid habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and has minimal fertilizer needs due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal; thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Heavy fertilization is generally not required and can be harmful.
