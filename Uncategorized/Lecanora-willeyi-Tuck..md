## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
Willey's Rim Lichen thrives in environments with moderate, indirect light and high ambient humidity. It needs frequent moisture from mist or rain, allowing for dry periods, and should not be fertilized as it absorbs nutrients from the atmosphere and its substrate.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required or beneficial. Lichens obtain nutrients from atmospheric deposition and their substrate, and are sensitive to nutrient enrichment.
