## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting its native humid subtropical environment. As a hemiparasite often found in moderately fertile savannas, it benefits from moderate to low fertilizer application, with rich soils potentially being detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to low; native habitats are often sandy and moderately fertile. Over-fertilization should be avoided, especially as it is a hemiparasite.
