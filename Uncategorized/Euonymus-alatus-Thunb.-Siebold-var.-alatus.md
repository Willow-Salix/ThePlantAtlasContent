## Care Guide
This adaptable shrub thrives in full sun to partial shade, favoring moderate and consistent moisture in well-drained soil. While somewhat drought-tolerant once established, it benefits from occasional watering during dry spells. Fertilizer requirements are minimal, generally needing only a light annual feeding if soil nutrients are low.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is typically sufficient, especially in less fertile soils.
