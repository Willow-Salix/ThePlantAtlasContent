## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
Seep Monkeyflower thrives in full sun to partial shade, demanding consistently moist to wet soil conditions, never allowing it to dry out. Emulate its natural riparian habitat by providing ample water. Moderate fertilization during the growing season will support vigorous growth and blooming.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer at half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season, or rich, organic soil.
