## Care Guide
American Senna thrives in full sun with consistently moist, well-draining soil, although it shows good drought tolerance once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it requires minimal fertilization. This hardy plant is relatively low-maintenance, adapting well to various garden conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced fertilizer or compost can be beneficial if soil nutrients are very poor.
