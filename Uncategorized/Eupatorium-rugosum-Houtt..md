| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (from Quebec to Florida, and west to Texas and Nebraska) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial to full shade, especially protected from intense afternoon sun, mimicking its growth in woodland understories or forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, reflecting the regular rainfall and organic matter present in its native forest habitat. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry, but ensure good drainage. |

## Care Guide
White Snakeroot thrives in conditions similar to its native temperate woodlands. Provide partial to full shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It generally requires low to moderate fertilization, benefiting most from organic soil amendments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Natural forest soils are enriched by decomposing organic matter; amending with compost or a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient.
