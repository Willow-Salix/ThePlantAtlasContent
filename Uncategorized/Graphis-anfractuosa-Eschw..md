## Care Guide
As a crustose lichen from tropical rainforests, Graphis anfractuosa Eschw. demands high humidity and consistent moisture. It requires low to medium indirect light, mimicking its natural shaded habitat. No external fertilization is necessary, as it derives nutrients from its immediate environment.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. This lichen obtains nutrients from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust, decaying matter) on its substrate.
