## Care Guide
This adaptable legume thrives in temperate climates with full to partial sun. It requires moderate watering and has low to moderate fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen fertilizer is not necessary. A general-purpose, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly if needed.
