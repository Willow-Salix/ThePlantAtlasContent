## Introduction
Ixeris is a genus of Asian flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.
Concepts of which species should be included in the genus have changed in recent years because of the use of molecular investigations. Numerous species formerly regarded as members of Ixeris have been moved to other genera; (Agoseris, Crepidiastrum, Ixeridium, Lactuca, Paraixeris, Paraprenanthes,  Sonchella or Youngia). Species remaining in Ixeris  or of uncertain affiliations are listed below.

## Care Guide
Ixeris is a resilient plant native to temperate and subtropical grasslands, making it quite adaptable. It thrives in full sun to partial shade with moderate, consistent watering and does not require heavy fertilization. Overall, it is a relatively low-maintenance plant that prefers well-draining soil.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the active growing season. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly, as these plants are not typically heavy feeders.
