## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and parts of Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade, mimicking the filtered light under a forest canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity is crucial. Regular misting or placement in a humid environment is necessary, as lichens absorb moisture directly from the air and rainfall. Avoid direct watering that leads to waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Haematomma is a genus of crustose lichens established by Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo in 1852. It is the sole genus in the Haematommataceae, a family circumscribed by Josef Hafellner in 1984. Commonly called bloodstain lichens, the species assigned to this genus are widely distributed in tropical and temperate areas.
The genus name Haematomma means "bloody eye", a reference to the color of the lichen's apothecia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in humid, temperate forest conditions with bright, indirect light or partial shade. It requires high atmospheric moisture and absolutely no external fertilization, as it is very sensitive to nutrient overloads.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens are highly sensitive to external nutrient inputs and can be harmed by conventional fertilizers.
