## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across the temperate Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, parts of Asia (Siberia, China, Japan), and eastern North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest Understory, often specifically in moist, shaded, rocky areas with calcareous (limestone) soil. |
| **Sunlight** | Full to partial shade. This fern is accustomed to the dappled light of a forest floor and should be protected from direct, intense sunlight, which can scorch its fronds. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil is essential, mirroring the damp conditions of its native woodland habitat. Water regularly to prevent the soil from drying out completely, but ensure good drainage to avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Gymnocarpium robertianum, the limestone fern or scented oakfern, is a fern of the family Cystopteridaceae.

## Care Guide
To mimic its native temperate forest understory, provide ample shade and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil. This fern thrives with high humidity and minimal fertilization, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-cycling from organic matter on limestone-rich substrates.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient. In its native environment, it derives nutrients from decaying organic matter. Apply a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly, perhaps once or twice during the growing season (spring and summer).
