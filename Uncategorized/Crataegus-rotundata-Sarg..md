## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
The Roundleaf Hawthorn is a hardy temperate plant that thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering, especially when young, but becomes drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization is generally light, as it adapts well to average garden soils.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization in spring, especially in poor soils. Generally not a heavy feeder and can thrive in average garden soil.
