## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in cool, consistently moist to wet, acidic conditions, resembling its native subalpine bogs and wet forests. It prefers partial sun, though it can tolerate full sun with ample moisture, and requires only light annual fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with an acid-specific formula, typically once a year in spring. Avoid over-fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor, acidic bog soils.
