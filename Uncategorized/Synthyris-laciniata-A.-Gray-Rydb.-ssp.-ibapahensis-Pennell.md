## Introduction
Veronica is the largest genus in the flowering plant family Plantaginaceae, with about 500 species. It was formerly classified in the family Scrophulariaceae. Common names include speedwell, bird's eye, and gypsyweed.
Taxonomy for this genus was changed in the early 21st century, with the genus Hebe and the related Australasian genera Derwentia, Detzneria, Chionohebe, Heliohebe, Leonohebe and Parahebe now included. Monophyly of the genus is supported by nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and cpDNA.
The taxa of the genus are herbaceous annuals or perennials, and also subshrubs, shrubs or small trees when Hebe is included. Most of the species are from the temperate Northern Hemisphere, though with some species from the Southern Hemisphere; Veronica sect. Hebe is mostly from New Zealand.

## Care Guide
This plant, native to the high desert mountains of Utah and Nevada, thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires well-drained soil and is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent, deep watering. Fertilizer needs are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to lean, rocky environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light, balanced fertilizer once annually in spring is sufficient, or even less, as it thrives in lean soils.
