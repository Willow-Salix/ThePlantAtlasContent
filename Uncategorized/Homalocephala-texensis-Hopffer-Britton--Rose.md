## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert (specifically Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts) |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full, direct sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily; thrives in intense sun exposure typical of desert environments. |
| **Watering** | Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly or cease entirely during winter dormancy to prevent rot. |

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives on neglect, requiring full sun and very infrequent watering, especially in cooler months, to prevent root rot. Provide extremely well-draining, lean soil and minimal fertilization to mimic its arid native habitat and ensure robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs. Fertilize sparingly (once or twice per growing season) with a diluted, balanced cactus-specific fertilizer, or not at all if repotting regularly.
