| **Native Origin** | California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Chaparral, Foothill Woodland, Serpentine Barrens) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives with ample direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant. Water moderately during the cooler growing season (winter/spring) and reduce significantly or withhold water during hot, dry summers, as it prefers dry conditions then. |

## Introduction
Erigeron () is a large genus of plants in the composite family (Asteraceae). It is placed in the tribe Astereae and is closely related to the Old World asters (Aster) and the true daisies (Bellis). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and the highest diversity occurs in North America.

## Care Guide
This fleabane thrives in full sun and well-drained, low-nutrient soils, mirroring its native serpentine habitats in California. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring moderate watering only during its active growing period and very little during the hot summer dormancy.

### Fertilizer
Low fertility needs. Avoid heavy fertilization; a very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied in spring, but it is often not necessary, especially in suitable low-nutrient soil mixes.
