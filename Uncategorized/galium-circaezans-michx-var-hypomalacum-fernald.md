## 🌱 Overview
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in conditions that mimic its native woodland understory environment. Provide partial to full shade and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained. Enrich the soil with organic matter to support its moderate nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate, benefiting from nutrient-rich soil high in organic matter, akin to a forest floor.
