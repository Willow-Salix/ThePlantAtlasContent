## 🌱 Overview
Dubautia or na'ena'e is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. The genus was named after Joseph Eugène DuBaut (1796–1832), an officer in the French Navy who participated in Freycinet's expedition.
The entire genus is endemic to Hawaii. It contains more species than the other two genera in the silversword alliance, including cushion plants, shrubs, trees, and lianas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in conditions mirroring its native subtropical dry to mesic shrubland, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires consistent, but not excessive, watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions to prevent root issues. Light fertilization during active growth will support its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer, considering its adaptation to nutrient-moderate volcanic soils.
