| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland / Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (requires direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day) |
| **💧 Water** | Low (drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering, especially during dry summer months. Prefers well-drained soil and is susceptible to rot in consistently wet conditions). |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant lupine thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil, mimicking its native dry, rocky habitats. Water sparingly once established, especially during summer, and avoid rich fertilizers as it naturally enriches the soil with nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to None (as a legume, it fixes nitrogen and thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soils; avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers).
