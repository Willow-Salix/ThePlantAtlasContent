## Introduction
Carica is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caricaceae including the papaya (C. papaya syn. C. peltata, C. posoposa), a widely cultivated fruit tree native to the American tropics.
The genus was formerly treated as including about 20-25 species of short-lived evergreen pachycaul shrubs or small trees growing to 5–10 m tall, native to tropical Central and South America, but recent genetic evidence has resulted in all of these species other than C. papaya being reclassified into three other genera.

## Care Guide
This montane species thrives in conditions mimicking its native humid Andean forests. Provide bright indirect light to partial sun and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil. Regular fertilization supports its fast growth and fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high, especially during active growth and fruiting, using a balanced fertilizer
