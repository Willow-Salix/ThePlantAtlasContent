## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Madagascar, Réunion, Mauritius |
| **Climate** | Tropical Humid Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; avoid direct sunlight which can scorch fronds. Prefers dappled shade conditions typical of an understory or epiphytic habit. |
| **Watering** | Keep substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged. As an epiphyte/lithophyte, it requires excellent drainage. High ambient humidity is crucial; misting or a pebble tray can be beneficial. |

## Introduction
Asplenium is a genus of about 700 species of ferns, often treated as the only genus in the family Aspleniaceae, though other authors consider Hymenasplenium separate, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, a different chromosome count, and structural differences in the rhizomes. The type species for the genus is Asplenium marinum.
The most common vernacular name is spleenworts, applied to the more "typical" species. A. nidus and several similar species are called bird's-nest ferns, the Camptosorus group is known as walking ferns, and distinct names are applied to some other particularly well-known species.

## Care Guide
This tropical fern thrives in conditions mimicking its native humid forest environment. Provide low to medium indirect light, consistently moist substrate without waterlogging, and ensure high humidity. Fertilize sparingly during its active growth period to support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient. Use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half or quarter strength once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer).
