## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bartramia moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded environments, mimicking its native temperate and subalpine habitats. Ensure the substrate remains damp and provide high humidity, while avoiding direct sunlight and heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Mosses are low-nutrient plants; if used, a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly once or twice a year.
