## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pacific Northwest of North America (specifically Washington and Oregon) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Wet Meadow / Subalpine Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun in cooler climates, but can benefit from afternoon shade in hotter regions. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native habitat along streams and in marshes. Cannot tolerate dry conditions. |

## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
This hemiparasitic plant thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, favoring full sun to partial shade in its native Pacific Northwest montane wet meadows. Ensure high soil moisture and provide a lean to moderately fertile soil, as it obtains most nutrients from host plants. Avoid drought at all costs.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a hemiparasitic plant, it extracts nutrients from the roots of host plants. Rich soils can be detrimental; a lean, well-draining yet moisture-retentive soil is ideal.
