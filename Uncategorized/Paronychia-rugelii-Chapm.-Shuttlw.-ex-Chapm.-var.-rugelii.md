## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida and Georgia, extending into Alabama and Mississippi) |
| **Climate** | Warm Temperate / Subtropical Savanna and Woodland (Dry Sandy Pinelands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers open, exposed conditions with direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established and intolerant of consistently wet conditions. |

## Introduction
Paronychia is an inflammation of the skin around the nail, often due to bacteria or fungi.  
Its sudden (acute) occurrence is usually due to the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Gradual (chronic) occurrences are typically caused by fungi, commonly Candida albicans. 
Risk factors for paronychia include frequent hand washing and trauma to the cuticle, such as from chronic nail biting or hangnails.
Treatment typically involves antibiotics for bacterial infections and antifungals for fungal infections. If there is pus formation, incision and drainage may be necessary.
Paronychia is commonly mistakenly used interchangeably with herpetic whitlow or felon, which are distinct conditions.

## Care Guide
Rugel's Nailwort thrives in conditions mimicking its native dry, sandy pinelands, requiring abundant sunlight and excellent drainage. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to fully dry out, and avoid over-fertilization due to its adaptation to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very dilute general-purpose fertilizer.
