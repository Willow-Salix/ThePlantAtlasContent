## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest and Temperate Forest biomes, often found in disturbed areas, clearings, or forest margins, characterized by cold winters and moderate to cool summers with ample precipitation. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. As a pioneer species, it thrives in open, bright locations but can tolerate some shade. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil. While tolerant of some dry periods once established, regular watering during dry spells will promote healthier growth. |

## Care Guide
This circumboreal plant is highly adaptable, thriving in full sun to partial shade and preferring consistently moist, well-drained soil. It requires low to moderate fertility and generally does not need supplemental fertilizer. Its robust nature makes it relatively low-maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility. It typically thrives in average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization; excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
