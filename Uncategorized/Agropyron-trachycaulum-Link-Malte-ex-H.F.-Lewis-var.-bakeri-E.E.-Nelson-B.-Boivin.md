## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western and Northern North America (including much of Canada and the Western/Central United States) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grasslands, Prairies, and Montane Regions |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for robust growth) |
| **Watering** | Moderate, consistent moisture during establishment; allow topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Once established, it is notably drought-tolerant. |

## Care Guide
Baker's Slender Wheatgrass thrives in full sun and requires moderate, consistent watering, particularly when young. It is adapted to lean soils, so fertilization should be minimal. This North American native grass exhibits good drought tolerance once mature.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; adapts well to lean to moderately fertile soils. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer may be applied annually in spring if soil is very poor, but typically not required.
