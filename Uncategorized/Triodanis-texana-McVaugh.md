## Care Guide
This Texas native prefers sunny, well-drained locations, tolerating sandy or rocky soils. It requires moderate, infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Its adaptability to dry, open habitats makes it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typically thrives in nutrient-poor to average soils. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly if the soil is particularly deficient.
