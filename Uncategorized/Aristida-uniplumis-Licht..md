## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Africa (e.g., South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Angola), extending to East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula |
| **Climate** | Arid and Semi-Arid Grasslands, Savannas, and Deserts |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, requiring direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Very low; highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Aristida is a very nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. Aristida is distinguished by having three awns (bristles) on each lemma of each floret. The genus includes about 300 species found worldwide, often in arid warm regions. This genus is among those colloquially called three-awns wiregrasses, speargrasses and needlegrasses. The name Aristida is derived from the Latin "arista", meaning "awn".
They are characteristic of semiarid grassland. The Wiregrass Region of North America is named for A. stricta. Other locales where this genus is an important component of the ecosystem include the Carolina Bays, the sandhills of the Carolinas, and elsewhere, Mulga scrub in Australia, and the xeric grasslands around Lake Turkana in Africa. Local increases in the abundance of wiregrasses is a good indicator of overgrazing, as livestock avoid them.

## Care Guide
This resilient grass is well-suited to full sun and extremely dry conditions, needing infrequent watering. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making extensive fertilization unnecessary for its growth and health.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor, sandy, nutrient-deficient soils. Minimal to no fertilization is needed.
