| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland, Montane Grasslands, and Open Woodlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking sporadic rainfall patterns. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Silver Lupine variety thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean to moderately fertile soils, reflecting its arid to semi-arid native climate. Once established, it is drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering. Minimal fertilization is necessary due to its natural nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils and does not require additional nitrogen. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
