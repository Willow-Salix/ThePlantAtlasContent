| **Watering** | Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings; tolerant of drought once established, but benefits from infrequent, deep watering. |

## Introduction
Schiedea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It contains 35 species which are endemic to Hawaii.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native thrives in bright, sunny conditions reminiscent of its cliffside origin. Allow its well-draining soil to dry completely between waterings, as it's adapted to periods of drought. Provide light, balanced fertilizer during active growth to support its moderate nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer due to its adaptation to moderate-nutrient volcanic soils.
