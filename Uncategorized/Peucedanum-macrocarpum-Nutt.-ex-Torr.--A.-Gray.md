## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including much of the western United States and southwestern Canada (e.g., British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Drylands and Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, consistent with its open native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water sparingly, allowing the soil to completely dry out between waterings. Mimic natural rainfall patterns by providing water during active growth (spring) and significantly reducing it during dry summer dormancy or winter. |

## Introduction
Peucedanum is a genus of flowering plant in the carrot family, Apiaceae. Peucedanum boasts a global presence with diverse spread of morphological features. Peucedanum species are characterized by dorsally compressed mericarps, slightly prominent dorsal ribs, narrowly winged lateral ribs, and a broad commissure. However, the vast diversity of morphology, fruit forms, and phytochemical production makes classifying species in the Peucedanum challenging. Historically relevant in traditional medicine, Peucedanum's taxonomic complexity arises from its extensive diversity.
Peucedanum's taxonomy is being reshaped by novel genomic insights, prompting ongoing revisions with promising implications for ethnopharmacological research and the broader understanding of plant biodiversity. These efforts hold potential for advancements in therapeutic discoveries and contribute to the ecological significance of this globally diverse genus.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in bright, direct light and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native arid scrubland environments. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between waterings, and reduce hydration significantly during its dormant periods. Fertilization needs are minimal, best applied lightly in spring if the soil is poor.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; its native soils are often lean. A light, balanced fertilizer application once in early spring is sufficient, or it may not require any if grown in reasonably fertile soil.
