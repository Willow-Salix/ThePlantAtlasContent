## Care Guide
This widespread temperate moss thrives in consistently moist, humid environments with low to medium indirect light, mimicking its natural forest floor habitat. It requires frequent watering to maintain dampness and generally does not need any supplemental fertilization, relying on its natural environment for nutrients.

### Fertilizer
No supplemental fertilizer is needed; mosses obtain nutrients from air and water and are sensitive to chemical inputs.
