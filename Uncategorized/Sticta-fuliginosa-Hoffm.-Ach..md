## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across humid temperate and boreal regions globally, including parts of Europe (e.g., Atlantic seaboard), North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Appalachian Mountains), Asia, and Australasia. |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate Forest (characterized by consistent high atmospheric humidity, moderate temperatures, and often dense canopy providing shade). |
| **Sunlight** | Low to very low light, indirect or filtered light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can cause desiccation and damage. |
| **Watering** | Extremely high atmospheric humidity is critical. Requires frequent misting or cultivation in a consistently humid environment (e.g., terrarium). The substrate should remain damp but not waterlogged. |

## Introduction
Sticta is a genus of lichens in the family Peltigeraceae. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in tropical areas, and includes about 114 species. These lichens have a leafy appearance, and are colored brown or black. Sticta species with cyanobacteria as photobionts can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, and due to their relative abundance and high turnover, they contribute appreciably to the rainforest ecosystem. They are commonly called spotted felt lichens.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in highly humid, shaded environments mimicking its native humid temperate forest habitat. Provide consistent high atmospheric moisture and very low light, avoiding any direct sun or chemical fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is needed. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and their substrate and are sensitive to chemical inputs.
