## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (wet pine savannas, bogs, and flatwoods) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring significant direct sunlight as it grows in open, unshaded habitats. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently wet to saturated soil, mimicking its native bog and wet savanna environment. It can tolerate standing water. |

## Introduction
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and consistently saturated soil, replicating its natural wetland habitat in the southeastern US. It prefers nutrient-poor, acidic conditions and should be watered frequently to keep the soil wet. Minimal fertilization is needed.

### Fertilizer
Low. Native to nutrient-poor, often acidic soils, this plant does not require heavy fertilization and may be sensitive to excessive nutrients.
