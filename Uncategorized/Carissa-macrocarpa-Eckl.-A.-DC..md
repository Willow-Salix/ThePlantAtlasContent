## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions of Southern Africa, primarily South Africa (Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Coastal Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth and fruit production, but can tolerate partial shade. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the topsoil to dry out completely between waterings. Established plants are highly drought-tolerant, but consistent moisture during flowering and fruiting seasons is beneficial. |

## Introduction
Carissa macrocarpa is a shrub native to tropical and southern Africa. It is commonly known as the Natal plum, amathungulu, big num-num or large num-num.
Carissa macrocarpa deals well with salt-laden winds, making it a good choice for coastal areas.  It is commonly found in the coastal bush of the Eastern Cape and Natal. It produces shiny, deep green leaves and snowy white flowers whose perfumed scent intensifies at night. Like other Carissa species, C. macrocarpa is a spiny, evergreen shrub containing latex. They bloom for months at a time. The ornamental plump, round, crimson fruit appears in summer and fall (autumn) at the same time as the blooms. In moderate, coastal areas the fruits appear through the year. The fruit can be eaten out of hand or made into pies, jams, jellies, and sauces. Some claim that other than the fruit, the plant is poisonous. However, this claim is a myth, possibly based on similarities to other plants with milky sap. The College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences at
University of California, Davis rates the plant as mildly toxic.
It appears in the South African National tree list as number 640.3.
A traditional food plant in Africa, this little-known fruit has potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare.

## Care Guide
The Natal Plum thrives in conditions similar to its native subtropical coastal scrubland, requiring abundant sunlight and moderate, well-drained watering. Once established, it demonstrates strong drought tolerance and needs only occasional, balanced fertilization to support its growth and fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize once or twice annually in spring/early summer with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a liquid feed at half strength.
