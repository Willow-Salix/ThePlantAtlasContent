## 🌱 Overview
Dicranum is a genus of mosses, also called wind-blown mosses or fork mosses. 
These mosses form in densely packed clumps. Stems may fork, but do not branch. In general, upright stems will be single but packed together. Dicranum is distributed globally. In North America these are commonly found in Jack pine or Red pine stands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, high-humidity environments, mirroring its native boreal and alpine habitats. Provide moderate to bright indirect light, ensuring the substrate remains damp but never waterlogged. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its low nutrient requirements.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient needs. A highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/10th strength) can be applied very sparingly once a year, or not at all.
