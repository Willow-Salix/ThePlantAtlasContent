## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gunnera manicata thrives in consistently wet, rich soil and high humidity, mimicking its native subtropical moist forest habitat. It prefers partial shade, especially in warmer climates, though it can tolerate full sun if kept constantly moist. Regular, heavy feeding is crucial to support its enormous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Heavy feeder; requires regular fertilization with a balanced, high-nitrogen fertilizer, especially during the growing season, to support its rapid, massive growth.
