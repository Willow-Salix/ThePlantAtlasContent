## Care Guide
This nocturnal-blooming cactus thrives in bright light conditions, mimicking its native tropical dry forest and scrubland habitat. It requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry out between sessions, and benefits from minimal fertilization during its growth period.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, diluted cactus or succulent fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season.
