## Introduction
Pediomelum is a genus of legumes known as Indian breadroots. These are glandular perennial plants with palmately-arranged leaves. They have a main erect stem with inflorescences of blue or purple flowers and produce hairy legume pods containing beanlike seeds. Some species have woody roots while others have starchy tuber-like roots which can be eaten like tuber vegetables such as potatoes or made into flour. Indian breadroots are native to North America. Many species have synonymy with genus Psoralea.

## Care Guide
Pediomelum trinervatum thrives in conditions mimicking its arid native scrubland environment, requiring full sun and very minimal watering. It is highly drought-tolerant and prefers lean, well-draining soil without the need for frequent fertilization. Focus on mimicking its dry, sunny habitat for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in lean, well-draining soils and does not require frequent fertilization.
