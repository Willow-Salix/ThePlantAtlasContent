## Introduction
Spiraea , sometimes spelled spirea in common names, and commonly known as meadowsweets or steeplebushes, is a genus of about 80 to 100 species of shrubs in the family Rosaceae. They are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest diversity in eastern Asia.
The genus formerly included the herbaceous species now segregated into the genera Filipendula and Aruncus; recent genetic evidence has shown that Filipendula is only distantly related to Spiraea, belonging in the subfamily Rosoideae.

## Care Guide
Sargent Spiraea thrives in its native temperate montane climate with full sun exposure and consistent moisture. Ensure well-drained soil to prevent root rot, and apply a light fertilizer in spring to support its growth and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding in early spring with a balanced slow-release fertilizer, particularly in poor soils.
