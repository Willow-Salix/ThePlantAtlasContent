## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America, Caribbean, Tropical Africa, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, India |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Avoid direct, intense sunlight, which can scorch its delicate stems. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged; allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. High humidity is crucial, mimicking its rainforest habitat. |

## Introduction
Rhipsalis is a genus of epiphytic flowering plants in the cactus family, typically known as mistletoe cacti. They are found in parts of Central America, the Caribbean and northern regions of South America. One species, Rhipsalis baccifera also inhabits locations in Africa and Asia, and is the only cactus species naturally occurring in the Old World. This is the largest and most widely distributed genus of epiphytic cacti (those which live on other plants without damaging them).
The scientific name Rhipsalis derives from the Ancient Greek term for wickerwork, referring to the plants' morphology.

## Care Guide
Mistletoe Cactus thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical rainforest home, requiring bright, indirect light and consistently moist but well-draining soil. High humidity is beneficial, and light fertilization during warmer months will support healthy growth. Avoid direct sun and overwatering to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., half strength once a month).
