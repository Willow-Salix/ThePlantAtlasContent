## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, specifically northern Canada (Labrador, Quebec, Newfoundland) and Greenland |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest / Subarctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to bright indirect light. Naturally found in open, rocky areas or under sparse tree cover, it tolerates some direct morning sun but needs protection from intense afternoon heat. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is key, mimicking the damp, mossy conditions of its native habitat. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging; allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Stellaria is a genus of about 190 species of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae, with a cosmopolitan distribution. Common names include starwort, stitchwort and chickweed.

## Care Guide
Stellaria labradorica thrives in cool, subarctic conditions with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide partial sun or bright indirect light, protecting it from strong direct afternoon sun. Fertilize very lightly to replicate its naturally lean native environment.

### Fertilizer
Low. Its native soils are often nutrient-poor. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season, or incorporate a small amount of compost.
