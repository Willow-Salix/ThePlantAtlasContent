## Introduction
Rorippa is a globally distributed genus in the family Brassicaceae, with species occurring on all continents except for Antarctica. Rorippa species are natively distributed in the Northern Hemisphere through Eurasia and North America, and dispersed into the Southern Hemisphere through long-distance dispersal. Rorippa species are annual to perennial herbs, usually with yellow flowers and a peppery flavour. They are known commonly as yellowcresses.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Lake Tahoe Yellowcress requires consistently moist to wet soil and ample sunlight, reflecting its native habitat in open montane wet meadows. Ensure good drainage while maintaining high moisture levels, and provide moderately fertile soil without heavy fertilization. It is sensitive to drought and prefers cooler temperatures.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, well-draining soil with average to rich organic matter, typical of wetland-associated native plants.
