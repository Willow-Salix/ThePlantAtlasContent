## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern North America (primarily United States and parts of Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie and Open Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water moderately during extended dry periods, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, reflecting its adaptation to varying rainfall. |

## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
Stiff Goldenrod thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native prairie and open woodland habitats. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering only during prolonged dry spells. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it prefers average to lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; thrives in average to lean, well-draining soils, as it's accustomed to naturally fertile yet not overly rich prairie conditions.
