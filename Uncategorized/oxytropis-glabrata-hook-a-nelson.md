## 🌱 Overview
Oxytropis is a genus of plants in the legume family. It includes over 600 species native to subarctic to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. It is one of three genera of plants known as locoweeds, and are notorious for being toxic to grazing animals. The other locoweed genus is the closely related Astragalus. Most oxtropis species are native to Eurasia and North America, but several species are native to the Arctic. These are hairy perennial plants which produce raceme inflorescences of pink, purple, white, or yellow flowers which are generally pea-like but have distinctive sharply beaked keels. The stems are leafless, the leaves being all basal. The plant produces legume pods containing the seeds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and requires lean, very well-drained soils, mimicking its native rocky habitats. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen, as it is a nitrogen-fixing legume.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; thrives in lean, well-drained soils. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
