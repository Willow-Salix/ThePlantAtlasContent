## Care Guide
Coiled Lousewort thrives in cool, moist conditions reminiscent of its native subalpine meadows. Provide full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Fertilization should be kept minimal, as it is adapted to leaner soils and is hemiparasitic.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility; prefers lean to moderately rich, well-drained soils. Avoid over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen.
