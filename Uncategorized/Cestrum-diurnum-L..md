## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | West Indies (Caribbean islands), extending to parts of Central and South America. |
| **Climate** | Tropical |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) for best flowering, but can tolerate partial shade, particularly in very hot climates where some afternoon shade can be beneficial. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent and regular watering to keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged. Mimicking tropical rainfall patterns, it appreciates consistent moisture, especially during warm growing seasons, but can tolerate brief dry spells once well-established. |

## Introduction
Cestrum is a genus of — depending on authority — 150-250 species of flowering plants in the family Solanaceae. They are native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Americas, from the southernmost United States (Florida, Texas: day-blooming cestrum, C. diurnum) south to the Bío-Bío Region in central Chile (green cestrum, C. parqui). They are colloquially known as cestrums or jessamines (probably from the word "jasmine", due to their fragrant flowers).
They are shrubs growing to 1–4 m (3 ft 3 in – 13 ft 1 in) tall. Most are evergreen; a few are deciduous. All parts of the plants are toxic, causing severe gastroenteritis if eaten.

## Care Guide
Originating from tropical regions, Day Jessamine flourishes in full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide regular watering and monthly fertilization during its growing season to encourage abundant flowering. It thrives in warm temperatures and appreciates stable, humid conditions.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer applied monthly during its active growing season (spring through summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during fall and winter.
