## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rare birch requires a site with full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained, acidic to neutral soil. Ensure regular watering to prevent drought, especially during dry periods, and provide moderate fertilization to support its growth in conditions similar to its native Appalachian mountain habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in moderately fertile, acidic to neutral soils rich in organic matter. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost application in spring is beneficial, especially for young trees.
