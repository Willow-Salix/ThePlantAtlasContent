## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically mountainous regions of the Western United States (e.g., Sierra Nevada, Rocky Mountains, Cascade Range) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine (open meadows, rocky slopes, and forest margins) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Tolerant of drought once established, reflecting periods of drier summer conditions in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Erigeron () is a large genus of plants in the composite family (Asteraceae). It is placed in the tribe Astereae and is closely related to the Old World asters (Aster) and the true daisies (Bellis). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and the highest diversity occurs in North America.

## Care Guide
Eaton's fleabane thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-draining soil, mimicking its montane origins. It requires moderate watering during its active growth but is quite drought-tolerant once established. Minimal fertilization is typically needed for this resilient native wildflower.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils characteristic of its native environment; heavy fertilization is generally not required.
