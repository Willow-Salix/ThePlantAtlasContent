| **Climate** | Temperate Forest/Woodland Edge |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade (prefers full sun for best flowering) |
| **Watering** | Regular watering during dry periods, especially when young. Established plants are moderately drought-tolerant but benefit from consistent moisture during the growing season. |

## Introduction
Campsis, commonly known as trumpet creeper or trumpet vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae, native to woodlands in China and North America. It consists of two species, both of which are vigorous deciduous perennial climbers, clinging by aerial roots, and producing large trumpet-shaped flowers in the summer. They are reasonably hardy and do well with the support of a wall, preferring full sun.

## Care Guide
Trumpet Vine is a vigorous climber preferring full sun and consistent moisture to thrive, especially during its growing season. It's adaptable to various soil types and generally requires minimal fertilization, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant once established. Pruning is essential to manage its aggressive growth and promote better flowering.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization; thrives in average to rich soil. Over-fertilizing can promote foliage over blooms. A balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, if needed, is sufficient.
