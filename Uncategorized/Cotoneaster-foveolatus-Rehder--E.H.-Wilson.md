## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western China (Sichuan, Yunnan provinces) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it often grows in open areas or on woodland edges, indicating a need for good light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting moderate rainfall patterns in its native mountains, but can tolerate some drought once established. |

## Introduction
Cotoneaster  is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, native to the Palaearctic region (temperate Asia, Europe, north Africa), with a strong concentration of diversity in the genus in the mountains of southwestern China and the Himalayas. They are related to hawthorns (Crataegus), firethorns (Pyracantha), photinias (Photinia), and rowans (Sorbus).
Depending on the species definition used, between 70 and 300 different species of Cotoneaster are described, with many apomictic microspecies treated as species by some authors, but only as varieties by others.
The majority of species are shrubs from 0.5–5 m (1.6–16.4 ft) tall, varying from ground-hugging prostrate plants to erect shrubs; a few, notably C. frigidus, are small trees up to 15 m (49 ft) tall and 75 cm (30 in) trunk diameter. The prostrate species are mostly alpine plants growing at high altitudes (e.g. C. integrifolius, which grows at 3,000–4,000 m (9,800–13,100 ft) in the Himalayas), while the larger species occur in scrub and woodland gaps at lower altitudes.

## Care Guide
This shrub thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its temperate mountain origins. It is relatively low maintenance regarding fertilization and becomes quite drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for various garden conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average, well-drained soils and is not a heavy feeder. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient if soil fertility is a concern.
