## Care Guide
Depauperate Fleabane is an alpine species requiring full sun and exceptionally well-drained soil, mimicking its native rocky habitats. Provide moderate watering during its growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid heavy fertilization due to its adaptation to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor alpine soils. Minimal or no fertilization is generally required.
