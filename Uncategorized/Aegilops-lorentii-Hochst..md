## Care Guide
Lorent's goatgrass is a resilient plant best suited for full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean and semi-arid habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and thrives without regular fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to average soils and generally does not require fertilization. If soil is extremely deficient, a very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once annually.
