## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Asia (e.g., Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China - Xinjiang), Siberia, and parts of European Russia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-arid Steppe/Continental |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), mimicking its exposure in open steppe environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently but deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to simulate irregular steppe rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Astragalus is a large genus of over 3,000 species of herbs and small shrubs, belonging to the legume family Fabaceae and the subfamily Faboideae. It is the largest genus of plants in terms of described species. The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Common names include milkvetch (most species), locoweed (in North America, some species) and goat's-thorn (A. gummifer, A. tragacantha). Some pale-flowered vetches (Vicia spp.) are similar in appearance, but they are more vine-like than Astragalus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Phaca salsula thrives in bright, open conditions, requiring full sun and well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant, so water sparingly and allow the soil to dry out between waterings. Fertilization needs are low due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally requires minimal fertilization. A very light, balanced feed can be applied once a year if growth appears weak.
