## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Slender Rose Gentian, provide full sun and consistently wet, acidic, nutrient-poor soil, replicating its native bog habitat. Ensure high humidity and never allow the soil to dry out to support its moisture-loving nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers lean, acidic, and nutrient-poor soils. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, as heavy feeding can be detrimental.
