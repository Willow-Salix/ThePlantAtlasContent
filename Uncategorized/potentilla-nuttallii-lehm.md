## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Nuttall's Cinquefoil thrives in full to partial sun with well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications. Fertilization needs are low, mirroring its adaptation to montane environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring may benefit plants in very poor soils.
