## 🌱 Overview
The genus Platanthera belongs to the subfamily Orchidoideae of the family Orchidaceae, and comprises about 150 species of orchids. The members of this genus, known as the butterfly orchids or fringed orchids, were previously included in the genus Orchis, which is a close relative (along with the genus Habenaria). They are distributed throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are terrestrial and have tubercules. The genomes of Platanthera zijinensis and Platanthera guangdongensis have been sequenced as model species to study partial and full mycoheterotrophy.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid orchid thrives in consistently wet, acidic, and nutrient-poor conditions, reflecting its native temperate wetland habitats. Provide bright indirect light to partial direct sun and ensure the growing medium remains continuously moist. Fertilize very sparingly to avoid root burn.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs. Use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly, primarily during active growth.
