## Introduction
Schisandra, the magnolia vines, is a genus of twining shrubs that generally climb on other vegetation. Various authors have included the plants in the Illiciaceae
Schisandra (also spelled Schizandra) is native to Asia and North America, with a center of diversity in China.
Some species are commonly grown in gardens as ornamentals. It is a hardy deciduous climber which thrives in almost any kind of soil; its preferred position is on a sheltered, shady wall. It may be propagated by cuttings of half-matured shoots in August.
Despite its common name "magnolia vine", Schisandra is not closely related to the true magnolias.

## Care Guide
This Schisandra thrives in the humid, dappled light conditions of its native Southeastern US forest understory. Ensure consistently moist, well-drained soil and provide partial to full shade for optimal growth, with occasional feeding to support its moderate nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or amendments with organic matter to mimic rich forest soil.
