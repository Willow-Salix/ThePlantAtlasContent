## Care Guide
The Silver Fir thrives in cool, moist, temperate montane conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained, acidic to neutral soil. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry periods, and protect from extreme heat and prolonged drought. Fertilization is typically minimal if soil quality is good.

### Fertilizer
Moderate nutrient needs. Generally thrives in moderately acidic to neutral, humus-rich forest soils. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, slow-release formula in spring if growth appears weak.
