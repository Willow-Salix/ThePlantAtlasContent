## Introduction
Elodea is a genus of eight species of aquatic plants often called the waterweeds described as a genus in 1803. Classified in the frog's-bit family (Hydrocharitaceae), Elodea is native to the Americas and is also widely used as aquarium vegetation and laboratory demonstrations of cellular activities. It lives in fresh water. An older name for this genus is Anacharis, which serves as a common name in North America.
The introduction of some species of Elodea into waterways in parts of Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and New Zealand has created a significant problem and it is now considered a noxious weed in these areas.

## Care Guide
This aquatic plant thrives when fully submerged in clean, fresh water under moderate to bright indirect light. Maintain good water quality through regular changes and provide low to moderate fertilization tailored for aquatic plants. Ensure stable water temperatures within its temperate range.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs, absorbed primarily from the water column. Benefits from occasional liquid aquatic plant fertilizers.
