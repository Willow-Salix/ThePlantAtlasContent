## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (especially Western and Northern regions), Europe, and potentially other cool-temperate areas. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate to Subalpine Climates, often found in rocky, exposed habitats. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to full sun exposure, depending on specific microhabitat within its native range. |
| **Watering** | Regular moisture from ambient humidity, fog, or rainfall; can tolerate periods of drought but requires rehydration to be metabolically active. |

## Introduction
Porpidia is a genus of crustose lichens in the family Lecideaceae. Porpidia species primarily inhabit siliceous rocks, pebbles, and stonework, with rare occurrences on bark, wood, and compacted soil. The thallus, or body of the lichen, varies in appearance from thick and crusty to barely visible. It may form a continuous layer or develop cracks resulting in a segmented, areolate structure. The colour of the thallus ranges from grey and white to orange.

## Care Guide
This saxicolous (rock-dwelling) lichen thrives in cool, moist, temperate to subalpine conditions. Provide bright, indirect to full sun exposure and ensure high ambient humidity or regular misting. Avoid traditional fertilizers as they are extremely sensitive to excess nutrients and pollution.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens absorb trace nutrients directly from the air and precipitation, and are highly sensitive to pollution and chemical fertilizers.
