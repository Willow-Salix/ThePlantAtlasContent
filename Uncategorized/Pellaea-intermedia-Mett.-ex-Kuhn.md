# Intermediate Cliffbrake

*Pellaea intermedia Mett. ex Kuhn* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Africa (e.g., South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini) |
| **Climate** | Dry Subtropical to Temperate, rocky montane regions |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to dappled sunlight; protect from harsh, direct afternoon sun, especially in warmer climates. |
| **Watering** | Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings; avoid constant wetness as it prefers well-drained conditions found in rocky crevices, but keep consistently moist during active growth periods. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Pellaea intermedia thrives in conditions mimicking its native rocky habitats in Southern Africa, preferring partial shade and well-draining soil. It requires consistent moisture during its growing season but tolerates slight drying between waterings, and benefits from light, infrequent fertilization to support its moderate growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. Use a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once every 2-3 months) during the growing season; avoid over-fertilization.
