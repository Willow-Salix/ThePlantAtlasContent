## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and northern Mexico (Sonora) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland to Semi-Arid Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in bright, unobstructed light typical of its open native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low; extremely drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to completely dry out between waterings to mimic natural rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Cercocarpus, commonly known as mountain mahogany, is a small genus of at least nine species of nitrogen-fixing flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae. They are native to the western United States and northern Mexico, where they grow in chaparral and semidesert habitats and climates, often at high altitudes. Several are found in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion.

 
The classification of Cercocarpus within the Rosaceae has been unclear. The genus has been placed in the subfamily Rosoideae, but is now placed in subfamily Dryadoideae.
Members of the genus are deciduous shrubs or small trees, typically reaching heights of 3–6 m (9–18 ft) tall, but exceptionally up to 13 m (40 ft) high. C. montanus usually remains under 1 m (3 ft) high because of incessant grazing by elk and deer.
The name is derived from the Greek words κέρκος (kerkos), meaning "tail" and καρπός (karpos), meaning "fruit".  It refers to the tail-like plume on the fruits.

## Care Guide
This hardy shrub flourishes in conditions mimicking its native dry, rocky habitats, preferring full sun and excellent drainage. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, along with very little to no supplemental fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Very low; typically does not require fertilization. If soil is extremely poor, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring may be beneficial.
