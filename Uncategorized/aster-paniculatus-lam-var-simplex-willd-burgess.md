## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Panicled Aster thrives in temperate climates, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist soil conditions. It is a low-maintenance plant regarding nutrients, growing well in average soil without the need for heavy fertilization. Regular watering is key to mimic its natural wetland environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a native plant often found in average to disturbed soils, it is not highly demanding of nutrients. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly if soil is particularly poor, but over-fertilization should be avoided.
