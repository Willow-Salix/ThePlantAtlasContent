## Introduction
Pohlia is a genus of mosses in the family Mniaceae, found on all continents including Antarctica. Some of its species are native to multiple continents. The center of diversity is the Northern Hemisphere.
The genus name of Pohlia is in honour of Johann Ehrenfried Pohl (1746–1800), who was a German physician and botanist. 
The genus was circumscribed by Johann Hedwig in Descriptio et Adumbratio microscopio-analytica Muscorum
Frondosorum vol.1 on page 98 in 1785-1787.

## Care Guide
Pohlia moss thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, mimicking its native habitat. Ensure consistent moisture and high humidity, avoiding direct sunlight. Fertilization should be minimal, as these plants have very low nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses are sensitive to high nutrient concentrations; light fertilization (if any) with specialized moss food or diluted general fertilizer is sufficient.
