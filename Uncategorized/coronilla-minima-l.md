## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, even poor, soils, reflecting its Mediterranean origins. Provide infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid over-fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and generally requires little to no supplemental fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
