## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | House Range, Millard County, Utah, USA |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, particularly appreciating some afternoon shade in hotter climates or at lower elevations. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, but extremely well-draining soil, especially during its active growing period (spring/early summer). Mimic snowmelt conditions, providing regular moisture without ever allowing waterlogging. Can tolerate drier conditions after flowering. |

## Introduction
Primula () is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. They include the primrose (P. vulgaris), a familiar wildflower of banks and verges. Other common species are P. auricula (auricula), P. veris (cowslip), and P. elatior (oxlip). These species and many others are valued for their ornamental flowers. They have been extensively cultivated and hybridised (in the case of the primrose, for many hundreds of years). Primula are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, south into tropical mountains in Ethiopia, Indonesia, and New Guinea, and in temperate southern South America. Almost half of the known species are from the Himalayas.
Primula has over 500 species in traditional treatments, and more if certain related genera are included within its circumscription.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native limestone scree environment: excellent drainage, consistent moisture during the growing season, and good sun exposure. It is crucial to prevent waterlogging, especially in winter. Provide lean to moderately fertile soil and protect from intense, prolonged heat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, or incorporate compost into the soil. Avoid rich, heavy feeding.
