## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Mexico and Northern Central America (Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest / Subtropical Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun for optimal growth and flowering, tolerating some partial shade but performing best with bright, direct light. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out significantly between waterings. Mimic native wet and dry seasons; water regularly during active growth and reduce during drier periods. Established plants are highly drought-tolerant. |

## Introduction
Leucaena leucocephala is a small fast-growing mimosoid tree native to southern Mexico and northern Central America (Belize and Guatemala). It is now naturalized throughout the tropics including parts of Asia.
Common names include white leadtree, white popinac, horse tamarind, ipil-ipil, koa haole, and tan-tan.
Leucaena leucocephala is used for a variety of purposes, such as fencing, soil fertility, firewood, fiber, and livestock fodder.

## Care Guide
The White Leadtree thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering, allowing for dry periods between applications, reflecting its tropical dry forest origin. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally needs low fertilizer, especially nitrogen, making it adaptable to less fertile soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it often thrives in poor soils and may not require additional nitrogen. A balanced fertilizer or one higher in phosphorus and potassium can be applied sparingly if growth is slow.
