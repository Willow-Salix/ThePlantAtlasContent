## Introduction
Calystegia (bindweed, false bindweed, or morning glory) is a genus of about 25 species of flowering plants in the bindweed family Convolvulaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution in temperate and subtropical regions, but with half of the species endemic to California.  They are annual or herbaceous perennial twining vines growing 1–5 m tall, with spirally arranged leaves. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, 3–10 cm diameter, white or pink, with (in most species) a sometimes inflated basal epicalyx.
The genus bears much similarity to a related genus Convolvulus, and is sometimes combined with it; it is distinguished primarily by the pollen being smooth, and in the ovary being unilocular.
Some of the species, notably Calystegia sepium and C. silvatica, are problematic weeds, which can swamp other more valuable plants by climbing over them, but some are also deliberately grown for their attractive flowers.
Calystegia species are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Bedellia somnulentella (recorded on C. sepium) and small angle shades.
The name is derived from two Greek words κάλυξ (kálux) "cup", and στέγη (stégē) "a covering", meaning "covering cup", this refers to the large bracts that cover the sepals.

## Care Guide
This temperate plant prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained, average to poor soil. It requires moderate watering, with tolerance for dry periods once established. Minimal fertilization is needed.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it naturally occurs in average to poor soils and does not require rich fertilization.
