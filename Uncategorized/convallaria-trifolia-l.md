## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in cool, consistently wet environments with ample shade, replicating its native bog and wet forest habitats. Ensure the soil never dries out and provide only minimal fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season is sufficient, as native bog soils are often nutrient-poor and acidic.
