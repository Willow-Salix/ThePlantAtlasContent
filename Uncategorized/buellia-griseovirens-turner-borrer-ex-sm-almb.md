## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers moderate to indirect light; thrives under forest canopy dappled light and should be protected from intense, direct sunlight which can cause desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies entirely on atmospheric moisture (humidity, rain, dew) for hydration. Requires consistently high ambient humidity and frequent exposure to moisture, rather than traditional soil-based watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Buellia is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Caliciaceae. The fungi are usually part of a crustose lichen. In this case, the lichen species is given the same name as the fungus. But members may also grow as parasites on lichens (lichenicolous). The algae in the lichen (the photobiont partner) is always a member of the genus Trebouxia.
Lichens in the genus are commonly called disc lichens, or button lichens. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains almost 1000 species.
Genetic studies indicate that the genus Amandinea and Buellia may be the same, although this is not widely accepted.
The genus Buellia was described by Italian botanist Gioseppe De Notaris in 1846 and named after his friend, Esperanzo Buelli.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in humid, temperate forest environments with indirect light and clean air. Care focuses on maintaining high ambient humidity and providing regular access to atmospheric moisture, as it does not require soil or conventional watering or fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required or recommended. Lichens absorb all necessary nutrients directly from the air and rain, and fertilizers can be detrimental.
