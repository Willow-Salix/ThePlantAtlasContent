| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Italy (including Sardinia and Corsica) |

## 🌱 Overview
Alnus cordata, the Italian alder, is a tree or shrub species belonging to the family Betulaceae, and native to the southern Apennine Mountains (Campania, Basilicata and Calabria, mainly on western mountain sides) and the north-eastern mountains of Corsica. It has been introduced in Sicily, Sardinia, and more recently in Central-Northern Italy, other European countries (France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, United Kingdom) and extra-European countries (Chile, New Zealand), where it has become naturalised.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Italian alder is a robust tree that prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist conditions, drawing from its riparian native habitat. It is low-maintenance regarding nutrients due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it adaptable to various soil types once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Alnus species are nitrogen-fixers, enriching the soil they grow in. Supplemental fertilization is rarely needed unless in extremely poor soil.
