## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, accustomed to coastal and dry forest environments. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and fertilize lightly during active growth to mimic its natural, lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season. Prefers lean, well-draining soil.
