## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico (specifically Jalisco) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Montane Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to dappled shade; can tolerate some morning sun but prefers protection from intense afternoon light, mimicking its understory or forest edge habitat. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil is ideal, reflecting the high humidity and regular rainfall of its native cloud forest. Avoid prolonged drought or waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Rubus is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, subfamily Rosoideae, most commonly known as brambles. Fruits of various species are known as raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, and bristleberries. It is a diverse genus, with the estimated number of Rubus species varying from 250 to over 1000, found across all continents except Antarctica.
Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles like roses; spines, bristles, and gland-tipped hairs are also common in the genus. The Rubus fruit, sometimes called a bramble fruit, is an aggregate of drupelets. The term cane fruit or cane berry applies to any Rubus species or hybrid which is commonly grown with supports such as wires or canes, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry. The stems of such plants are also referred to as canes.

## Care Guide
MacVaugh's dewberry thrives in conditions that mimic its native Mexican montane cloud forest habitat. Provide partial sun to dappled shade, consistently moist but well-drained soil, and moderate fertility. Ensuring good humidity and protection from harsh afternoon sun will promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility; benefits from an annual application of a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer or compost, consistent with nutrient cycling in forest environments.
