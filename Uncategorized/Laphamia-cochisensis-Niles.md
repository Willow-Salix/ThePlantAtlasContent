## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Cochise County, Arizona, USA |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. As a desert plant, it tolerates intense direct light but can benefit from some afternoon shade in the hottest climates. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and deep watering. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking drought conditions of its native habitat. |

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in conditions mirroring its native Arizona desert habitat. Provide full to partial sun, extremely well-draining soil, and infrequent, deep watering. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, to avoid nutrient overload.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. It is adapted to nutrient-poor rocky soils, so heavy feeding is detrimental. A very dilute general-purpose fertilizer can be applied once during the growing season if desired.
