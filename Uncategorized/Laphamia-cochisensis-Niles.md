## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in conditions mirroring its native Arizona desert habitat. Provide full to partial sun, extremely well-draining soil, and infrequent, deep watering. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, to avoid nutrient overload.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. It is adapted to nutrient-poor rocky soils, so heavy feeding is detrimental. A very dilute general-purpose fertilizer can be applied once during the growing season if desired.
