## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (Appalachian Mountains, Pacific Northwest), Europe (Scandinavia, UK), East Asia (Japan); typically found in freshwater stream and waterfall environments. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Freshwater Stream Environments |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light; often found in shaded or partially shaded stream banks or under water, protected from direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant submersion in clean, cool, oxygenated freshwater or consistently wet conditions (e.g., in splash zones of waterfalls or streams). Highly sensitive to drying out. |

## Introduction
Pyrenothrix is a small genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Pyrenotrichaceae. It comprises two species of filamentous lichens, which are organisms formed by a symbiotic relationship between fungi and photosynthetic partners. The genus is characterized by its unique structure, featuring densely arranged filaments composed of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) wrapped in fungal threads. Pyrenothrix species form dark greyish-brown growths on various surfaces, with one species found on tree bark and the other on leaves in tropical forests. The genus was circumscribed in 1917 by American scientist Lincoln Ware Riddle, based on specimens collected in Florida. Pyrenothrix is distinguished from other lichens by its intricate cellular structure and reproductive features, including specialized spore-producing structures.

## Care Guide
Lichenothrix riddlei Henssen is an aquatic lichen requiring stable, cool, and extremely clean freshwater environments with constant moisture. It thrives in low to moderate indirect light and is highly sensitive to pollutants and drying conditions, making it unsuitable for typical plant care.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. As a lichen, it obtains nutrients from its environment (water, air, substrate). Extremely sensitive to water pollution and dissolved chemicals.
