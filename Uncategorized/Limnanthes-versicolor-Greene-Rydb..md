## Introduction
Limnanthes, the type genus of the family Limnanthaceae, consists of annual herbaceous plants commonly known as the meadowfoams. The seven species are all native to coastal and adjoining regions (inland valleys, foothills and mountains) of western North America, where they typically grow in marshy habitats, such as the margins of vernal pools. Some are endemic to California.
General form ranges from decumbent to erect, with leaves either pinnately lobed or compound; the lobes or leaflets may themselves range from entire to deeply lobed. Both 4- and 5-sepaled and petaled members are known.
The white meadowfoam Limnanthes alba is of commercial interest for its oil, while several other species are rare or endangered. Honey produced by bees that pollinate Limnanthes alba has the distinct flavor of toasted marshmallows.
L. douglasii is widely cultivated as a hardy annual, its white and yellow flower colour giving it the common name of poached egg plant.

## Care Guide
Variegated Meadowfoam thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring consistently moist conditions during its spring growing season to mimic its native vernal pool habitat. As an annual, it naturally completes its life cycle and can tolerate dry summer conditions, needing only low to moderate fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, applied during active growth to support flowering.
