## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus bicolor is a species of lupine known as the miniature lupine, Lindley's annual lupine, pigmy-leaved lupine, or bicolor lupine.
It is a showy flowering annual or perennial plant native to western North America, from northwestern Baja California, throughout California, and north to British Columbia. It is found in diverse habitats below 3,000 feet (910 m), including: grasslands; chaparral; oak, mixed conifer and Joshua tree woodlands; coastal sage scrub; and open conifer forests. It often shares habitats with other prolifically blooming spring and early summer wildflowers, including the California poppy.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Miniature Lupine thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and expect it to tolerate drought once established. Fertilization is generally unnecessary due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers which can inhibit flowering.
