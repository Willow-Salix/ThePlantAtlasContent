## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern Australia (Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodlands and Wet Sclerophyll Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open, well-lit positions typical of its native woodland and forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Its native climate experiences regular rainfall but can also have drier spells, suggesting tolerance to some drought once established in well-drained soil. |

## Introduction
Acacia, commonly known as wattles or acacias, is a genus of about 1,084 species of shrubs and trees in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the pea family Fabaceae. Initially, it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa, South America, and Australasia, but is now reserved for species mainly from Australia, with others from New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. The genus name is Neo-Latin, borrowed from Koine Greek ἀκακία (akakia), a term used in antiquity to describe a preparation extracted from Vachellia nilotica, the original type species.
Several species of Acacia have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established.

## Care Guide
Acacia mucronata thrives in full sun to partial shade with moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it requires little to no additional fertilizer, especially avoiding high-nitrogen formulas. Plant in well-drained soil to mimic its native temperate woodland habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes its own nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. A low-phosphorus native plant fertilizer can be used sparingly if growth seems poor.
