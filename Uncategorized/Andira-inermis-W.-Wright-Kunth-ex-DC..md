## Introduction
Andira is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is distributed in the tropical Americas, except for A. inermis, which also occurs in Africa. It was formerly assigned to the tribe Dalbergieae, but molecular phylogenetic studies in 2012 and 2013 placed it in a unique clade within subfamily Faboideae named the Andira clade.
Compared to other Faboideae the genus has unusual systems of root nodules and fruits, which are drupes. In most species the fruits are dispersed by bats, and in some they are dispersed by rodents. They may also be dispersed on water.
Plants of the genus are used in traditional medicine in Brazil to treat fever and as purgatives and vermifuges. The treatments are toxic in high doses, however. Chemical compounds isolated from the genus include isoflavones, flavanols, glycosides, pterocarpans, chromone, and ursolic acid.

## Care Guide
The Cabbagebark Tree thrives in full sun and prefers a tropical environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. Provide regular water during its active growth, allowing for slight drying between waterings, and expect it to tolerate moderate drought once established. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, slow-release product, as it is a nitrogen-fixing legume.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer generally required due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice a year during the growing season is sufficient, especially for young trees.
