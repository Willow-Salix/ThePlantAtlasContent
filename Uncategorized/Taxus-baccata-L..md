## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western, Central, and Southern Europe, including parts of Great Britain and Ireland, extending to Northwest Africa (Morocco, Algeria) and Southwest Asia (Caucasus, northern Iran). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in partial to full shade, especially as an understory tree in its native habitat. Can tolerate full sun in cooler, moist temperate climates, but prefers some protection from intense afternoon sun in hotter regions. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting the moderate to high rainfall of its native temperate forests. While established plants show good drought tolerance, waterlogging should be avoided. |

## Introduction
Taxus baccata is an Old World species of evergreen tree in the family Taxaceae. It is the tree originally known as yew, though with other related trees becoming known, it is sometimes called common yew, European yew, or, in North America, English yew. It is a woodland tree in its native range, including much of Eurasia and Northwest Africa. All parts of the plant except the fleshy aril are poisonous, with toxins that can be absorbed through inhalation, ingestion, and transpiration through the skin.
The wood has been prized for making longbows and for musical instruments such as lutes. Yews are often grown as ornamental trees, hedges or topiaries, including in churchyards, where they sometimes reach great age; many explanations have been given for this planting, especially that the yew is associated with death, immortality, and rebirth. Multiple place names derive from the Proto-Celtic *eburos, but scholars disagree as to whether this meant the yew tree.

## Care Guide
The English Yew, a temperate forest native, thrives in partial to full shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging, and is not a heavy feeder, generally needing minimal fertilization. This adaptable evergreen is resilient once established.

### Fertilizer
Generally not a heavy feeder, as it grows in a variety of soil types from rich forest soils to limestone. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth is desired, otherwise minimal feeding is needed.
