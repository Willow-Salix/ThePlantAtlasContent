## Introduction
Manihot is a genus in the diverse milkspurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It was described as a genus in 1754.
Species of Manihot are monoecious trees, shrubs and a few herbs that are native to the Americas, from Arizona in the United States south to Argentina and Uruguay. The best known member of this genus is the widely cultivated cassava (Manihot esculenta).
Manihot species are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera including Endoclita sericeus and Hypercompe hambletoni.

## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings, and reduce water significantly during cooler months. It has very low fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to very low; native soils are poor in nutrients. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring if growth is desired, but it's often not necessary.
