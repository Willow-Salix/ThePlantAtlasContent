## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and very well-draining, nutrient-poor soils, typical of its semi-arid native habitat. Water sparingly and deeply, allowing the soil to completely dry out between waterings. Avoid over-fertilization to mimic its natural conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to nutrient-poor, often rocky or sandy soils. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
