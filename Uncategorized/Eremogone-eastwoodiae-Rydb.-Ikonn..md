## Introduction
Eremogone is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae, native to western North America, northern Asia, eastern Europe and northeastern Africa. Attempts to resolve taxonomic relationships within the Caryophyllaceae have resulted in the enlargement of Eremogone with species from other genera.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native arid montane habitat. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions, and is highly drought-tolerant. Fertilization should be minimal to non-existent.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization needed. If desired, apply a very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer once in early spring.
