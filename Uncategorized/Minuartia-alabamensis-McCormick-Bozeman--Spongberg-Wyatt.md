| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Northern Alabama, USA |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Limestone Glades/Cedar Barrens) |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), as it grows in exposed glade habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low to Moderate; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. It's adapted to well-drained, often dry conditions found in limestone glades. |

## Introduction
Minuartia is a genus of flowering plants commonly known as sandworts in the family Caryophyllaceae.
Minuartias are small annual or perennial plants which grow in otherwise inhospitable conditions such as on rocky ledges and in stony soil. Species are distributed in Eurasia and parts of Africa, including Europe, the Mediterranean region, northern and eastern Africa, the Caucasus, western and central Asia, Japan, and Far Eastern Russia.
Many Minuartia species were formerly classed in the genus Arenaria, and the obsolete genus Alsine. In 2014, the polyphyletic Minuartia sensu lato was recircumscribed, with many of the species transferred to other genera, including Cherleria, Eremogone, Facchinia, Mcneillia, Minuartiella, Mononeuria, Pseudocherleria, Rhodalsine, Sabulina, and Triplateia. Minuartia sensu stricto is characterized by the following features: leaves linear-setaceous; 5 acute sepals with 3, 5, or 9-veins; 5 white petals; 3 styles, forming 3-parted capsules.
The genus was named for Juan Minuart (1693–1768), a Spanish botanist and pharmacist.

## Care Guide
The Alabama Sandwort thrives in full sun and very well-drained conditions, mimicking its native limestone glades. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and requires little to no fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low to None; native to nutrient-poor, rocky, and shallow soils, over-fertilization can be detrimental.
