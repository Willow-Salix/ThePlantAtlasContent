## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States and Neotropical regions (e.g., Florida, Brazil, French Guiana) |
| **Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Humid Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect to low light. As a foliicolous lichen, it grows on leaves in the shaded understory of dense forests, protected from direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Extremely high and consistent humidity is crucial. Requires frequent atmospheric moisture from high rainfall and humidity; cannot tolerate dry conditions. Regular misting would be essential in a controlled environment. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
This foliicolous lichen thrives in a stable, high-humidity environment with indirect light, mimicking its natural tropical forest understory habitat. It depends on consistent atmospheric moisture for survival and does not require traditional soil or fertilizer, obtaining its minimal nutrients from the air and host leaf.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Lichens primarily obtain nutrients from atmospheric deposition and their substrate. Traditional fertilization is not applicable and could be detrimental.
