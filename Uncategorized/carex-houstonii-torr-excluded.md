## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This sedge thrives in consistently moist, rich soil with partial sun to partial shade, reflecting its native woodland and floodplain habitats. Ensure regular watering and amend soil with organic matter to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, organic soils. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or amend soil with compost in spring to support robust growth, particularly if soil is poor.
