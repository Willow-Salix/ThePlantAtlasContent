## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia, Alabama) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in pine flatwoods, open woodlands, and sandy clearings) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers full sun for optimal flowering as it naturally grows in open, exposed areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to regular watering; thrives with consistent moisture but requires well-drained soil, tolerating some drought once established, similar to its native habitat's rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Phlox (; Ancient Greek: φλόξ "flame"; plural "phlox" or "phloxes", Ancient Greek: φλόγες phlóges) is a genus of 68 species of perennial and annual plants in the family Polemoniaceae. They are found mostly in North America (one in Siberia) in diverse habitats from alpine tundra to open woodland and prairie. Some flower in spring, others in summer and fall. Flowers may be pale blue, violet, pink, bright red, or white. Many are fragrant.

## Care Guide
Florida Phlox thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil, mirroring its southeastern US native habitat. Provide consistent, moderate watering, especially during dry periods, and a low to moderate amount of balanced fertilizer in spring for best growth and bloom.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally does not require heavy fertilization, benefiting most from average to slightly rich soil amended with organic matter.
