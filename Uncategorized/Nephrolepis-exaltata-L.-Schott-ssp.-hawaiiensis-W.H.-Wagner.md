## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (endemic) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest/Wet Forest (Understory) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Avoid direct, harsh sunlight which can scorch fronds. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, as it thrives in high humidity and regular rainfall conditions found in its native habitat. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Nephrolepis is a genus of about 30 species of ferns. It is the only genus in the family Nephrolepidaceae, placed in the suborder Aspleniineae (eupolypods I) of the order Polypodiales in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). (It is placed in the Dryopteridaceae in some other classifications.) Species in this genus include plants commonly referred to as Boston ferns. The fronds are long and narrow, and once-pinnate, in the case of one Bornean species reaching thirty feet (nine meters) in length.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian subspecies thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical forest understory: high humidity, consistent moisture, and filtered light. Provide bright, indirect light and keep the soil consistently moist but never soggy. Regular misting or a pebble tray can help maintain the high humidity it prefers.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer). Less frequent feeding is needed in fall and winter.
