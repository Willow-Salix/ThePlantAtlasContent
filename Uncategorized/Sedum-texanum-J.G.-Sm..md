## Introduction
Sedum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, members of which are commonly known as stonecrops. The genus has been described as containing up to 600 species, subsequently reduced to 400–500. They are leaf succulents found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, but extending into the southern hemisphere in Africa and South America. The plants vary from annual and creeping herbs to shrubs. The plants have water-storing leaves. The flowers usually have five petals, seldom four or six. There are typically twice as many stamens as petals. Various species formerly classified as Sedum are now in the segregate genera Hylotelephium and Rhodiola.
Well-known European species of Sedum are Sedum acre, Sedum album, Sedum dasyphyllum, and Sedum hispanicum.

## Care Guide
This resilient succulent thrives in bright, sunny conditions reminiscent of its arid Texas homeland. It demands very little water, preferring its soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings, and requires minimal fertilization, making it an excellent low-maintenance choice.

### Fertilizer
Low; a diluted, balanced succulent fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
