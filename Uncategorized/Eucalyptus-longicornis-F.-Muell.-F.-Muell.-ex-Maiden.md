## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western Australia (Wheatbelt and Goldfields regions) |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid Woodland / Mallee Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in open, exposed woodlands. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering; highly drought-tolerant once established due to its adaptation to arid conditions with limited rainfall. Allow soil to dry out between waterings. |

## Introduction
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## Care Guide
Thrives in full sun and well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, reflecting its semi-arid Western Australian origins. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering to mimic natural rainfall patterns. Avoid high-phosphorus fertilizers, as it is adapted to low-nutrient environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; native soils are typically low in nutrients, especially phosphorus. If fertilization is necessary, use a low-phosphorus formula designed for native Australian plants.
