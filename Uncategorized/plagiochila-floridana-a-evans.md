| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical, specifically found in very moist, shaded microclimates within forests or along stream banks |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low, indirect light; ideally dappled shade or deep shade as it is sensitive to direct sunlight and desiccation |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist substrate is crucial, but not waterlogged. Requires very high atmospheric humidity, necessitating frequent misting or placement in a closed terrarium environment. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort thrives in conditions mimicking its native shaded, humid forest floor. Provide very low, indirect light and maintain consistently high humidity and moisture in the substrate without waterlogging. Fertilization is generally unnecessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely minimal to none; liverworts absorb nutrients from their environment and rainwater, and excess fertilizer can be detrimental.
