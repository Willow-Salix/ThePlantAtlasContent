## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | New Guinea, Bismarck Archipelago |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium, indirect light. As a forest floor plant, it is adapted to dappled light and will scorch in direct sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mimicking its native rainforest environment, it requires frequent watering and high humidity, allowing only the very top layer of soil to dry out slightly between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Zeuxine, commonly known as verdant jewel orchids, is a genus of about eighty species of orchids in the tribe Cranichideae. They are native to parts of tropical Africa, Asia, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, Australia and some Pacific Islands. They have relatively narrow, dark green leaves and small, dull-coloured resupinate flowers with the dorsal sepal and petals overlapping to form a hood over the column. The labellum has a pouched base and its tip has two lobes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fritz's Zeuxine thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical rainforest floor habitat, requiring low to medium indirect light and consistently moist soil with high humidity. Provide dilute fertilizer during active growth to support its development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a dilute, balanced orchid fertilizer during the active growing season (e.g., bi-weekly to monthly). Native rainforest soils are often nutrient-poor, with nutrients recycled from decaying organic matter.
