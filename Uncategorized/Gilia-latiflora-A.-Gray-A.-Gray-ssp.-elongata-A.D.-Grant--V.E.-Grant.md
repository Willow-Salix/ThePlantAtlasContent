## Care Guide
Hollyleaf Gilia thrives in hot, sunny conditions and is exceptionally drought-tolerant once established, requiring very little water. It prefers well-draining, lean soils and typically does not need regular fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Prefers lean soils. If growth appears stunted, a highly diluted, balanced fertilizer once in spring may be beneficial.
