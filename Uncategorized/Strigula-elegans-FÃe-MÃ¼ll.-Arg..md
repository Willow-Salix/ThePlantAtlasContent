## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, including Central and South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Humid Forests (e.g., Rainforests, Cloud Forests) |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect or filtered light. Prefers partial shade, avoiding direct, intense sun which can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity and consistent moisture from rain or dew. Requires frequent misting or placement in a humid environment; it absorbs moisture directly from the air. |

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in high humidity and indirect light, mimicking its native tropical forest understory. Ensure consistent moisture through regular misting and maintain high ambient humidity to prevent desiccation. No traditional fertilization is required, as it absorbs nutrients from the air and moisture.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. As a lichen, it obtains necessary nutrients primarily from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust) and the substrate surface, not from traditional soil fertilization.
