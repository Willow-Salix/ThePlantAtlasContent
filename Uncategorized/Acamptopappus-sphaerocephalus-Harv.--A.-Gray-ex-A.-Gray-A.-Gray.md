## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Acamptopappus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae described as a genus in 1873.
Acamptopappus is native to the  deserts in southwestern North America. The name is derived from a- (not), campto- (bent), and pappus (down).  They are also commonly known as goldenheads.
Acamptopappus plants are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora acamtopappi which feeds on A. sphaerocephalus.

## Care Guide
Rayless Goldenhead thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland and desert environment. Provide full sun and water very infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Fertilization is rarely needed for this drought-tolerant shrub.

### Fertilizer
Requires little to no fertilization. If grown in very poor soil, a single application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial, but it is often unnecessary.
