## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native temperate grasslands. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between waterings, as it is drought-tolerant once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, fertilizer needs are very low.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume. If needed, a very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly, but typically no additional nitrogen is required.
