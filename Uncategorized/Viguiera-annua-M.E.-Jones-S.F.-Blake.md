## Care Guide
This annual goldeneye flourishes in full sun and well-draining conditions, reflecting its native arid habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs infrequent watering once established. Minimal to no fertilization is necessary, making it an excellent low-maintenance plant for dry gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Generally, no fertilization is required, especially in moderately fertile soils. If soil is very poor, a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
