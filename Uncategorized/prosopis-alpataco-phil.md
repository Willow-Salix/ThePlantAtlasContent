## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arid and semi-arid regions of Argentina (e.g., Mendoza, San Juan, La Rioja, Catamarca, Santiago del Estero provinces) and Chile. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun; requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, thriving in open, exposed conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; extremely drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, as overwatering can lead to root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Prosopis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. The current circumscription of the genus contains three species found in northern Africa, the Middle East, Central and South Asia. Previously it also contained around 40 species of spiny trees and shrubs found in subtropical and tropical regions of the Americas and Africa, now mostly placed in genera Strombocarpa and Neltuma. They often thrive in arid soil and are resistant to drought, on occasion developing extremely deep root systems. Their wood is usually hard, dense and durable. Their fruits are pods and may contain large amounts of sugar. The generic name means "burdock" in late Latin and originated in the Greek language.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient desert plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, tolerating extended periods of drought. Due to its adaptation to arid, nutrient-poor soils and nitrogen-fixing capabilities, fertilization is rarely needed. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none; as a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen and is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils. Fertilize minimally only if growth appears stunted in extremely poor potting mixes.
