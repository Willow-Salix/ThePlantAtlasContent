## Introduction
Gypsophila () is a genus of flowering plants in the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae. They are native to Eurasia, Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Turkey has a particularly high diversity of Gypsophila taxa, with about 35 endemic species. Some Gypsophila are introduced species in other regions.
The genus name is from the Greek gypsos ("gypsum") and philios ("loving"), a reference to the gypsum-rich substrates on which some species grow. Plants of the genus are known commonly as baby's-breath, or bebe's breath, a name which also refers specifically to the well known ornamental species Gypsophila paniculata.

## Care Guide
This plant flourishes in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native European dry meadow habitats. It requires moderate to low watering, preferring to dry out between waterings, and thrives with minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Light to Infrequent. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soil. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring, or not at all if soil is amended with compost.
