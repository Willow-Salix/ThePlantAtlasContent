## Introduction
Coryphantha (from Greek, "flowering on the top"), or beehive cactus, is a genus of small to middle-sized, globose or columnar cacti. The genus is native to arid parts of Central America, Mexico, through Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas and north into southwestern, central, and southeastern Montana. With its two subgenera, 57 species and 20 subspecies, it is one of the largest genera of cactus.

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in very bright, direct sunlight and requires excellent drainage. Water sparingly and deeply only when the soil is completely dry, and significantly reduce watering in cooler months. Provide a well-draining soil mix and minimal fertilization to mimic its harsh native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; a diluted, low-nitrogen fertilizer specifically formulated for cacti and succulents can be applied once or twice during the active growing season.
