## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., California, Nevada, Arizona) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), consistent with its native open, desert habitats. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic natural desert rainfall patterns and prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Oenothera is a genus of about 145 species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas. It is the type genus of the family Onagraceae.  Common names include evening primrose, suncups, and sundrops. They are not closely related to the true primroses (genus Primula).

## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full sun and requires very little water, preferring dry soil between infrequent, deep waterings. Fertilization is rarely needed, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny gardens with well-draining soil.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; generally not required in cultivation. If growth appears very sluggish in extremely poor soil, a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year in spring.
