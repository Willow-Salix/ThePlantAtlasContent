## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Villous Woodyaster thrives in full sun and well-draining, rocky or sandy soil, characteristic of its native arid scrubland habitat in the Western U.S. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and has low fertilizer needs, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or low-maintenance gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer once annually in spring is sufficient, or none in naturally fertile soils.
