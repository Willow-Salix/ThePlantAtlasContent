# Common Greenshield Lichen

*Parmelia stictica (Duby) Nyl.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate and subtropical regions across Europe, North America, Asia, Africa, and Australia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate and Subtropical Woodlands/Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to partial shade; typically found on tree trunks and branches where light is filtered or indirect. Avoid intense, direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and regular moisture from rainfall or mist. As a lichen, it absorbs water from the air and needs periods to dry out completely between moisture events. Does not require traditional soil watering. |

## Introduction
Parmelia may refer to:

Parmelia (barque), the vessel that in 1829 transported the first settlers of the British colony of Western Australia
Parmelia (fungus), a genus of lichens with global distribution

## Care Guide
As an epiphytic lichen, care involves providing consistently high ambient humidity, good air quality, and indirect to partial sunlight. It absorbs moisture directly from the air and rain, so regular misting and allowing it to dry out periodically is crucial. Avoid chemical fertilizers and all forms of air pollution.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization is needed. Lichens derive nutrients from the atmosphere and their substrate; they are very sensitive to chemical pollutants and nutrient enrichment.
