## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (from Delaware south to Florida and west to Texas) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Open Woodlands, Pine Savannas, Sandhills) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant once established due to its native sandy, well-drained habitats. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sporobolus is a nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. The name Sporobolus means "seed-thrower", and is derived from Ancient Greek word σπόρος (spóros), meaning "seed", and the root of βάλλειν (bállein) "to throw", referring to the dispersion of seeds. Members of the genus are usually called dropseeds or sacaton grasses. They are typical prairie and savanna plants, occurring in other types of open habitat in warmer climates. At least one species (S. caespitosus from Saint Helena) is threatened with extinction, and another (S. durus from Ascension Island) is extinct.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient native grass thrives in full sun and well-drained, often sandy, soils. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, making it a low-maintenance choice. Fertilization is generally not necessary, as it adapts to lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers poor to moderately fertile soils. Minimal or no fertilization is typically needed for established plants.
