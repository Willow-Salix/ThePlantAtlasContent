| **Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland/Serpentine Barrens |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers open, exposed sites. |

## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
To care for the Serpentine Monkeyflower, provide full sun and mimic its native, nutrient-poor serpentine habitat with extremely well-draining soil. It requires minimal water, thriving on infrequent watering and no rich fertilizers, reflecting its adaptation to harsh, dry conditions.

### Fertilizer
None to very low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor serpentine soils and excessive fertilizer can be detrimental.
