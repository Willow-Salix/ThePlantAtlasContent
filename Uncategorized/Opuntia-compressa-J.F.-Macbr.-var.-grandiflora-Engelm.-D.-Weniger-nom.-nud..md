| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (e.g., USA, Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grasslands/Prairies |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open habitat exposure. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering; allow soil to completely dry out between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant, reflecting periods of low rainfall in its native climate. |

## Care Guide
This temperate prickly pear thrives in full sun and requires very little water, adapting to its native dry grassland environment. Ensure well-draining soil and minimal fertilization to mimic its natural conditions, allowing it to withstand both heat and cold.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed, as it naturally grows in lean soils. If desired, a diluted cactus/succulent formula can be applied once or twice during the active growing season.
