## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Stinking Hawthorn, native to the humid subtropical Southeastern US, thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, though it tolerates moderate drought once established, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. This hardy tree benefits from organic matter and is generally low-maintenance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It adapts to various soil types and benefits from organic matter; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil fertility is poor.
