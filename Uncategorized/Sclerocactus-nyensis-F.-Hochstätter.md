## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Nye County, Nevada, USA |
| **Climate** | Arid Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. Requires intense, direct sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily to prevent etiolation and promote healthy growth. |

## Introduction
Sclerocactus ("hard cactus", from Greek; refers to the hard, dry fruit) is a genus of cacti.  It comprises about 15 species, the exact number depending on the authority. These species are xerophytic. They are sometimes called 'fishhook cactus' or 'little barrels.'

## Care Guide
The Nye County Fishhook Cactus thrives in conditions mirroring its native arid desert. It demands full, intense sunlight and extremely infrequent watering, allowing the soil to completely dry out between applications. Fertilization is rarely necessary, aligning with its natural lean soil environment.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. If fertilizing, use a highly diluted, low-nitrogen fertilizer specifically for cacti and succulents, once or twice during the active growing season.
