## Introduction
Cenchrus is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family, native to tropical and warm temperate regions of the world. Its species are native to many countries in Asia, Africa, Australia, the Americas, and various oceanic islands.
Common names include buffelgrasses, sandburs, and sand spur. Such names allude to the sharp, spine-covered burrs characterizing the inflorescences of the members of the genus. Those previously classified as Pennisetum  are known commonly as fountaingrasses (fountain grasses).

## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and dry, poor soils, reflecting its arid native habitat. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires only infrequent watering, while fertilization is generally unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. It naturally grows in poor to average, well-draining soils and does not require rich nutrients. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
