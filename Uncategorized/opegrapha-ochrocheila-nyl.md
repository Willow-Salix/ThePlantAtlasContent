## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Oceanic regions of Western Europe (e.g., British Isles, France, Portugal), Macaronesia (Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands), and scattered locations in temperate North America and Australasia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Oceanic Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light, simulating the dappled shade found under a dense forest canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | High ambient humidity and frequent misting are essential, as lichens absorb moisture directly from the air and rain. Avoid periods of prolonged dryness and standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Opegrapha is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Opegraphaceae. These lichens form crusty patches on bark, rock, or other lichens, and are easily recognized by their distinctive black, slit-like or rounded fruiting bodies that look like tiny scribbles or dashes on the surface. The genus includes more than 100 species found worldwide, with most partnering with orange-pigmented green algae, though some live as parasites on other lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in highly humid environments with low, indirect light, mimicking its temperate oceanic forest origins. Consistent moisture through misting and clean air are paramount for its health, as it relies on atmospheric absorption for sustenance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and are highly sensitive to chemical inputs or pollutants.
