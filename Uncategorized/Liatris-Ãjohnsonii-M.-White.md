## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern United States (derived from parent species) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and abundant flowering, reflecting its open prairie habitat. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil. Water regularly, especially during dry periods or its first year. Established plants are quite drought-tolerant, typical of prairie flora. |

## Introduction
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## Care Guide
Johnson's Blazing Star thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its origins in temperate grasslands. It requires regular watering until established, after which it becomes drought-tolerant. Minimal fertilization is best to encourage strong, compact growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; these plants are adapted to average prairie soils. A light application of balanced fertilizer or compost in spring is usually sufficient, or none if the soil is already rich, to prevent leggy growth.
