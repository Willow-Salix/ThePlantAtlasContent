| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western Madagascar |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest / Thorn Scrub |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright indirect light. Prefers strong light exposure, typical of open scrublands. |
| **Watering** | Drought tolerant. Water thoroughly, then allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Significantly reduce watering during cooler or dormant periods (dry season simulation) to prevent caudex rot. |

## Care Guide
Doyerea thrives in conditions mimicking its native Madagascar dry forests, requiring ample sunlight and extremely well-draining soil. It is crucial to allow the soil to dry completely between waterings, especially minimizing water during dormancy, to prevent caudex rot and ensure its health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder. Apply a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer) only, as native soils are not exceptionally rich.
