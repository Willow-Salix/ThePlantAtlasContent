## Care Guide
The San Mateo Thorn-mint thrives in full sun and very well-drained, nutrient-poor soil. Provide moderate water during its winter-spring growth, then allow it to dry out completely during summer dormancy. Avoid fertilizer as it is adapted to lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, serpentine soils and can be harmed by rich soil amendments or synthetic fertilizers.
