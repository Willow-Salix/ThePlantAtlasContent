## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Arctic and Subarctic areas of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Greenland) and Eurasia (e.g., Northern Europe, Russia) |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra, Subarctic Bogs, Fens, and Wet Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, as it thrives in open, exposed wetland environments characteristic of tundra and bogs. |
| **Watering** | Constantly saturated or very wet soil is essential, mirroring its native bog and fen habitats; it should never be allowed to dry out. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
This plant requires consistently wet to saturated soil conditions, mimicking its native bog and fen environments. Provide full to partial sun exposure and avoid excessive fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic, peaty soils found in its native wetlands.
