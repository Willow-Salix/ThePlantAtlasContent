## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arid and semi-arid regions across Western North America (e.g., California, Arizona), parts of Europe, and Australia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Semi-Arid Temperate, often at high elevations |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in exposed, high-light conditions on rock surfaces. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, light moisture. As a lichen, it absorbs water from humidity, dew, and rain directly from the air and substrate. Tolerates long periods of dryness; allow complete drying between any applied moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Acarospora is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Acarosporaceae. Most species in the genus are crustose lichens that grow on rocks in open and arid places all over the world. They may look like a cobblestone road or cracked up old paint, and are commonly called cobblestone lichens or cracked lichens. They usually grow on rock (are "saxicolous"), but some grow on soil (terricolous) or on other lichens. Some species in the genus are fungi that live as parasites on other lichens (lichenicolous fungi). Acarospora is a widely distributed genus, with about 128 species according to a 2008 estimate.
Species in Acarospora may be shiny as if covered with a glossy varnish, or dull and powdery looking. They have a diverse range of colors, from the brilliant yellow bright cobblestone lichen, to the dark reddish-brown mountain cobblestone lichen, or they can appear tan, gray, or white, from a dusty-looking coating (pruina). They may grow in crustose forms like a warty surface (verrucose), like cracking-up old crust of paint (rimose), like a bunch of "islands" in a dry lake bed (areolate), like the flakes of cracking up paint are peeling up at the edges (sub-squamulous), or like the flakes are growing over others like scales (squamulous).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Acarospora dissipata is a saxicolous (rock-dwelling) lichen adapted to harsh, exposed conditions. It requires full to partial sun and infrequent, light moisture, with long dry periods between. Avoid fertilizers as they are unnecessary and potentially detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not required. Lichens obtain nutrients from atmospheric deposition and minerals from their substrate; added fertilizers can be harmful.
