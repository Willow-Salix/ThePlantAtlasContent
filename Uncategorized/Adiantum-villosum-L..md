## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical America, including parts of Florida, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean (e.g., West Indies) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; thrives in dappled shade or bright, filtered light. Direct sunlight will scorch its delicate fronds. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged. Requires frequent watering, especially in warm conditions, and high humidity is crucial. |

## Introduction
Adiantum (), the maidenhair fern (not to be confused with the similar-looking maidenhair spleenwort fern), is a genus of about 250 species of ferns in the subfamily Vittarioideae of the family Pteridaceae, though some researchers place it in its own family, Adiantaceae. The genus name comes from Greek, meaning "unwetted", referring to the fronds' ability to shed water without becoming wet.

## Care Guide
To care for the Woolly Maidenhair, mimic its tropical forest understory habitat by providing consistent warmth, high humidity, and plenty of indirect light. Ensure its soil remains moist but well-drained, and fertilize lightly during active growth to support its delicate foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization, preferring humus-rich soil. Apply a diluted liquid fern fertilizer during the growing season (spring to summer).
