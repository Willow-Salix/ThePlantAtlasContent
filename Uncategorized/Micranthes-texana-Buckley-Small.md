## 🌱 Overview
Micranthes is a genus of flowering plants in the saxifrage family. It was formerly included within the genus Saxifraga until DNA evidence from 1996 showed the members of what is now Micranthes are more closely related to Boykinia and Heuchera than to other members of the genus Saxifraga.
All members of this genus are herbaceous, with prominent basal leaves. They are found in temperate, arctic, and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.

To care for Texas Saxifrage, emulate its native temperate woodland environment by providing consistent moisture, well-draining soil, and partial to full shade. A moderate feeding schedule during its active growth period will support healthy foliage and flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and early summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
