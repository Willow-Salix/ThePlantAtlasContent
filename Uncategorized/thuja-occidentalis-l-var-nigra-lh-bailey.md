## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arborvitae thrives in consistently moist, well-drained soil under full sun to partial shade, reflecting its temperate forest and wetland origins. Regular watering is crucial, particularly during dry spells or establishment, while light fertilization in spring supports its growth without excessive demands.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula in spring is usually sufficient, as it grows in varied native soils, from nutrient-poor to rich.
