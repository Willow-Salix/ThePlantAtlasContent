## Care Guide
Arctic Groundsel thrives in cool, exposed conditions with full sun to bright indirect light and well-drained soil. Water moderately during its short growing season, ensuring the soil dries slightly between waterings, and fertilize very sparingly due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. These plants are adapted to nutrient-poor soils; a highly diluted balanced fertilizer may be applied once during the growing season, if at all.
