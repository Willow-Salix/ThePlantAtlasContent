## Care Guide
Pond Pine thrives in full sun and consistently moist to wet, acidic soils, mirroring its native wetland and bog habitats of the southeastern US. Ensure regular, ample watering to replicate the high humidity and often saturated conditions it naturally experiences. Minimal fertilization is typically required once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; prefers acidic soil conditions and does not require heavy fertilization once established.
