## Introduction
Camissonia, sometimes commonly known as sun cup or sundrop, is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the evening primrose family Onagraceae. A total of 12 species are known, nearly all from western North America, especially in the California Floristic Province, but also one from South America. Previous circumscriptions of the genus had recognized up to 62 species before it was split among other closely related genera.
The flowers generally open at dawn and are yellow. They are usually cup-shaped, thus the common name.
Formerly included in Oenothera, the species of Camissonia are distinguished by having a club- or head-shaped stigma, instead of the 4-part-divided stigma of Oenothera or Clarkia.
Camissonia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia cupes and Schinia deserticola, both of which feed on C. claviformis, the latter exclusively.
The genus is named after the botanist Adelbert von Chamisso.

## Care Guide
This desert-native plant requires full sun and infrequent watering, mimicking its arid habitat. Ensure excellent drainage and provide minimal to no fertilizer, as it thrives in poor soil conditions. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species best suited for desert-like garden environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in lean, well-draining soils and does not tolerate rich nutrient conditions.
