## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and Subarctic regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Yukon, Northwest Territories) and parts of Northern Eurasia (e.g., Siberia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers bright, open conditions, especially during the growing season. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture during the active growing season (spring/summer), but excellent drainage is crucial. Allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Reduce watering significantly in winter. |

## 🌱 Overview
Micranthes hieraciifolia (common names: hawkweed-leaved saxifrage, hawkweed-leaf saxifrage, stiff stem saxifrage or stiff-stemmed saxifrage) is a species of flowering plants. It is native to Europe, North America and temperate Asia, being distributed throughout the high Arctic and some alpine areas like Norway and the Carpathian Mountains, with a few isolated populations in the Central Eastern Alps of Austria and the Massif Central of France. It is generally uncommon.
It grows to a height of 10–20 cm. The leaves are oblong to rhombic, thick, and remotely toothed. The stem is single, stout and thick, and densely glandular. The flowers are produced in dense clusters, small and inconspicuous, with greenish to purplish petals.
It grows in meadows, on solifluction soil, and in places with well-developed moss.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide bright light, simulating its open alpine habitat, and ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Keep the soil consistently moist during the growing season, but reduce watering in colder months. This plant thrives in lean conditions and requires minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in lean soils. A very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, or often none at all.
