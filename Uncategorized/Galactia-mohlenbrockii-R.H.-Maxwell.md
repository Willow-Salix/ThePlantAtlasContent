## Introduction
Galactia is a genus of plants in the legume family (Fabaceae). It belongs to the subfamily Faboideae and tribe Diocleae They do not have an unambiguous common name, being commonly called  milk peas, beach peas or wild peas.

## Care Guide
Mohlenbrock's Galactia thrives in well-drained, rocky soils with full to partial sun exposure, characteristic of its native south-facing sandstone ledges. Mimic its natural dry habitat by allowing soil to dry thoroughly between infrequent waterings, ensuring excellent drainage. Fertilizer needs are minimal due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low; as a legume, it can fix nitrogen, reducing the need for external nitrogen. A light annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in very poor soils may suffice.
