## Care Guide
This plant is well-suited for arid conditions, requiring full sun exposure and minimal watering. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs very little fertilizer, thriving in lean, well-draining soils common to its native habitat.

Low; supplemental feeding is generally not critical. If desired, a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
