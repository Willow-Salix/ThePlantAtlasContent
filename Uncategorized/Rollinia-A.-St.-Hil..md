## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America, particularly Brazil, extending to parts of the Caribbean. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Subtropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Avoid harsh, direct afternoon sun which can scorch leaves, but ensure sufficient light for fruit production. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged. Requires high humidity, mimicking frequent rainfall of its native habitat. Water deeply when the top inch of soil begins to feel dry. |

## Introduction
Rollinia is a genus of plants in the family Annonaceae. While it is widely recognised as a distinct genus a monograph published in 2006 advocates its inclusion in Annona, which also contains custard apples and soursops.
Some Rollinia species produce edible fruits, such as biriba (Rollinia deliciosa). The flavor of the fruit is similar to that of a lemon meringue pie.  Ripe fruit is very soft and easily bruised, and cannot be stored for long periods of time.  It is usually eaten fresh, but it is also occasionally used in Brazil to make wine.  Biriba trees are small to medium in size, and require humid, tropical growing conditions.  The fruit is round, ripening from green to yellow, and the skin is covered with small projections that bruise to black when the fruit is handled.  Not widely cultivated, they have gained a small degree of popularity as dooryard and container trees elsewhere in the world. Rollinia sylvatica and Rollinia emarginata - the latter referred to as aratiku - also produce edible fruit, but are comparatively little-known and only very rarely cultivated.
A common pest of Rollinia is the giant silk moth (Arsenura armida), which roosts in masses on the trunks of the trees.

## Care Guide
Rollinia flourishes in conditions that replicate its tropical origin, demanding consistent moisture, high humidity, and protection from intense sun. Provide bright, indirect light and maintain a steady feeding schedule during its active growth phases. Ensure good drainage to prevent root issues while keeping the soil moist.

### Fertilizer
Regular feeding during the growing season with a balanced, slow-release or liquid fertilizer rich in organic matter, to support vigorous growth and fruiting.
