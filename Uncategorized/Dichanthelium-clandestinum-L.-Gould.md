## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America, ranging from eastern Canada south to Florida and west to Texas and Minnesota. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest and Temperate Grassland/Prairie |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) but can tolerate partial shade (3-6 hours direct sun), especially in warmer regions. |
| **Watering** | Thrives in consistently moist, well-drained soil, often found in areas with moderate to high rainfall. Tolerates some drought once established but performs best with regular moisture. |

## Introduction
Dichanthelium clandestinum is a species of grass known by the common name deertongue. It is native to eastern North America, including eastern Canada and the eastern United States.
This species is a rhizomatous perennial grass forming clumps of hairy stems up to 1.4 meters tall. Five to 10 leaves are located along the stem. Each is up to 25 centimeters long by 3 wide, lance-shaped, sometimes rigid, and hairless to slightly hairy. There are two types of inflorescence. The main panicle contains many spikelets with flowers that open and are pollinated. Another type of inflorescence contains cleistogamous flowers: flowers which do not open and pollinate themselves. These are located in the sheaths of the stem leaves and are sometimes hidden. They are produced later in the year than the open panicle. There are about 400,000 seeds per pound.
This plant is tolerant of high levels of aluminum in soils. It tolerates acid soils and thin, infertile soils. It can be used to revegetate reclaimed land such as mine spoils. The cultivar 'Tioga' has been available since 1975.
The seeds of deertongue attract many types of birds, such as turkeys. The grass is not considered a good forage for livestock because it is low in nutrients.

## Care Guide
Deertongue grass is a adaptable native plant that flourishes in full sun to partial shade and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is a low-maintenance species, requiring minimal fertilization and demonstrating good drought tolerance once established, making it ideal for naturalized plantings and erosion control.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a native grass, it generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil is poor, otherwise, it may not need additional nutrients.
