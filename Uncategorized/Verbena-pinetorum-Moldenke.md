## Introduction
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## Care Guide
Chihuahuan Vervain thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its desert origins. This resilient plant is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. Provide conditions that mimic an arid scrubland for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils. Excessive fertilization can harm the plant.
