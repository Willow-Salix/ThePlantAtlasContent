## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Globally distributed, commonly found in temperate and boreal regions, including North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forests and Woodlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to indirect bright light; avoid harsh, direct sun exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high ambient humidity and occasional direct moisture (e.g., misting or rain), allowing for periods of dryness. Does not absorb water via roots and should not be kept waterlogged. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rinodina is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 265 species. It is hypothesized that a few saxicolous species common to dry regions of western North America, southern Europe, North Africa and central Asia may date back 240 million years to the Middle Triassic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rinodina lichens thrive in environments with high humidity and indirect light, mimicking their natural temperate forest habitat. They require moisture from the air and occasional misting, rather than root watering, and derive all necessary nutrients from their environment, making traditional fertilization unnecessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed; lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate. Traditional fertilizers can be harmful.
