## 🧤 Care Instructions
Latin American Fleabane is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant once established and needs minimal fertilization. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot, as it is native to rocky, open areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all if grown in moderately fertile soil, is sufficient.
