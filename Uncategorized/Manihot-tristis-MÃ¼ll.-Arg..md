## Introduction
Manihot is a genus in the diverse milkspurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It was described as a genus in 1754.
Species of Manihot are monoecious trees, shrubs and a few herbs that are native to the Americas, from Arizona in the United States south to Argentina and Uruguay. The best known member of this genus is the widely cultivated cassava (Manihot esculenta).
Manihot species are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera including Endoclita sericeus and Hypercompe hambletoni.

## Care Guide
Manihot tristis thrives in conditions mimicking its native South American savanna and semi-arid habitats. Provide full sun and ensure excellent drainage, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings due to its drought tolerance. Fertilize sparingly during the growing season to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the main growing season, or a diluted liquid feed every 4-6 weeks.
