## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Australian native thrives in full sun within a temperate woodland climate, requiring regular watering initially but tolerating moderate drought once established. Ensure well-drained soil and use minimal, low-phosphorus fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is needed; if fertilizing, use a low-phosphorus formulation as it is adapted to nutrient-poor Australian soils and high phosphorus can be harmful.
