## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, particularly the Great Lakes region and parts of the Canadian Shield. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Wetland (Calcareous Fen/Marl Flat) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day for optimal growth. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently wet to saturated soil, mimicking its native fen habitat. The substrate should never be allowed to dry out. |

## Introduction
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## Care Guide
This wetland sedge thrives in full sun and demands consistently saturated, calcareous soil conditions. Ensure the roots never dry out, and provide minimal to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to the specific nutrient environment of its native fens.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to nutrient-poor or moderately rich wetland soils. Fertilize sparingly with a dilute, balanced formula, or not at all, to avoid over-enrichment.
