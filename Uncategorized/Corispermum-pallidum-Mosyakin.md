## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pale bugseed thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy or gravelly soils, mirroring its native arid steppe environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering, and prefers lean soils with minimal to no fertilization. This plant is low-maintenance, adapted to harsh, exposed conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; adapted to lean, sandy soils and typically does not require regular fertilization. Over-fertilization may be detrimental.
