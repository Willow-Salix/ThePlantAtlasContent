| **Native Origin** | Central Asia, Siberia (e.g., Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Southern Russia, Xinjiang in China) |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Steppe and Semi-Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), tolerating open, exposed conditions. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; infrequent but deep watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, indicative of its drought-tolerant nature. |

## Introduction
Corispermum is a genus of plants in the family Amaranthaceae. Common names given to members of the genus involve bugseed, tickseed, and tumbleweed. In general, these are erect annual plants with flat, thin leaves and topped with inflorescences of flowers with long bracts. Bugseeds are native to North America and Eurasia, but little is known about their taxonomy and distribution.

## Care Guide
Pale bugseed thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy or gravelly soils, mirroring its native arid steppe environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering, and prefers lean soils with minimal to no fertilization. This plant is low-maintenance, adapted to harsh, exposed conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low; adapted to lean, sandy soils and typically does not require regular fertilization. Over-fertilization may be detrimental.
