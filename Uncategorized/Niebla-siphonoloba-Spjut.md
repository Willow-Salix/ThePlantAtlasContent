## Care Guide
Niebla siphonoloba thrives in bright, well-ventilated environments with high atmospheric humidity, mirroring its native coastal fog desert. Replicate its habitat by frequent misting, ensuring complete drying between humid periods to prevent rot. It does not require fertilization, as it absorbs all necessary nutrients from the air.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens like Niebla siphonoloba absorb all necessary nutrients directly from the atmosphere (e.g., dust, rain, microscopic debris). Traditional fertilizers are not only unnecessary but can be detrimental.
