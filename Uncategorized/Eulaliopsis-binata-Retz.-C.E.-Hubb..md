## Care Guide
Sabaigrass thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native habitat on dry, open slopes and forest edges. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering only during its active growing season. This resilient grass has low fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance option for suitable climates.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder. Benefits from a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring, particularly if grown in very poor soils.
