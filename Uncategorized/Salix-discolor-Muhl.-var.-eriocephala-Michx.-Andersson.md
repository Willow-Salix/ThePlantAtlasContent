## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
To care for the Northern Pussy Willow, provide a location with full to partial sun and ensure the soil remains consistently moist or wet, replicating its native wetland habitat. While adaptable to various soil types, maintaining high moisture is crucial for its vigorous growth. Fertilization is generally moderate, benefiting from average soil fertility.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; thrives in average to moderately rich, well-draining soil but is adaptable to poorer soils as long as moisture levels are consistently high.
