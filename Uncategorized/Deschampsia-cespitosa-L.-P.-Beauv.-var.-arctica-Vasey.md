## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Subarctic regions of North America (including Alaska, Canada, Greenland) and parts of Arctic Eurasia. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. In its native tundra environment, it experiences long periods of direct sun during summer days, indicating a preference for high light exposure when available. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking the meltwater availability in its native habitat. It can tolerate wet, even boggy conditions, but also some periods of drier soil once established. |

## Introduction
Deschampsia is a genus of plants in the grass family Poaceae, commonly known as hair grass or tussock grass. The genus is widespread across many countries.
The genus is named for French physician and naturalist Louis Auguste Deschamps (1765–1842).
Deschampsia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera, including antler moth, the clay, clouded-bordered brindle, common wainscot, dark arches, dusky brocade, shoulder-striped wainscot, smoky wainscot and wall.
Deschampsia sometimes grow in boggy acidic formations, an example of which is the Portlethen Moss, Scotland. 
Deschampsia antarctica is the world's most southern monocot, and one of only two flowering plants of Antarctica.
Some species, such as D. cespitosa, are grown as ornamental garden plants.

## Care Guide
Arctic Tufted Hairgrass thrives in cool, moist environments with abundant sunlight during its active growing season. It needs consistently moist, well-drained soil and is highly tolerant of nutrient-poor conditions, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant for appropriate cold climates.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils common in tundra regions, so rich fertilization can be detrimental.
