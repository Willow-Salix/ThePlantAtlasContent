## Care Guide
Dot lichen thrives in consistently humid conditions with moderate, indirect light, mimicking its native temperate forest habitat. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and surface it grows on, therefore traditional watering or fertilization is unnecessary. Focus on maintaining high ambient humidity and avoiding direct sun.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. This lichen obtains all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rain) and leachates from its host surface.
