## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia (including Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines), Papua New Guinea, Northern Australia (Queensland, Northern Territory), and various Pacific Islands. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Coastal Forest and Lowland Rainforests, often in areas with high humidity and regular rainfall. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to full sun; can tolerate direct sun exposure, especially if gradually acclimatized, reflecting its ability to grow in exposed coastal areas or as a canopy tree. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, mimicking the frequent but well-drained rainfall of its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Planchonella is a genus of flowering trees in the gutta-percha family, Sapotaceae. Named in honour of Jules Émile Planchon, it was described by Jean Baptiste Louis Pierre. It contains around 110 mainly tropical species, which range from Pakistan through Southeast Asia and New Guinea to northern and eastern Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands. The genus is included in the larger genus Pouteria by some authorities, hence species such as Planchonella australis are also known as Pouteria australis.

## Care Guide
The Yellow-Boxwood thrives in bright, indirect to full sun conditions, requiring consistently moist, well-draining soil to mimic its tropical coastal origins. Provide moderate humidity and feed regularly during the warmer months to support its vigorous growth. Ensure proper drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize moderately during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength, supporting robust growth in potentially nutrient-rich forest or coastal soils.
