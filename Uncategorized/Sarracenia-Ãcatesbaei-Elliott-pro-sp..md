## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (coastal plains, bogs, and wet pine savannas) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Bog/Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (minimum 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) to encourage vigorous growth and vibrant pitcher coloration. |
| **Watering** | Keep the substrate consistently wet or waterlogged. Use only distilled water, rainwater, or reverse osmosis water, as tap water minerals are harmful. Never allow the soil to dry out. |

## Introduction
Pitcher plants are  carnivorous plants that have modified leaves known as pitfall traps—prey-trapping mechanisms featuring a deep cavity filled with digestive liquid. The traps of what are considered to be "true" pitcher plants are formed by specialized leaves. The plants attract and drown the prey with nectar.

## Care Guide
Sarracenia x catesbaei requires abundant full sun and perpetually wet, acidic, nutrient-poor soil to thrive, replicating its native bog habitat. Only use pure water (rain, distilled, RO) to keep the medium saturated, and refrain from fertilizing the roots as they are adapted to absorb nutrients from caught prey.

### Fertilizer
No root fertilization is needed, as these carnivorous plants obtain nutrients by catching insects. Applying conventional fertilizers can be detrimental.
