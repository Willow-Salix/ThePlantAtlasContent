## Introduction
Rosa blanda, commonly known as the smooth rose, meadow/wild rose, or prairie rose, is a species of rose native to North America. Among roses, it is closest to a "thornless" rose, with just a few thorns at the base. The meadow rose occurs as a colony-forming shrub growing to 1 m (3.3 ft) high, naturally in prairies and meadows. The roses are quite variable, the characteristics such as leaf tip number of prickles and glandular hairs usually do not always remain constant, thus it is often confused with Rosa arkansana or Rosa carolina, the two other prairie rose species.

## Care Guide
This hardy temperate rose thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide moderate fertilization during the growing season to encourage robust growth and flowering. It is adaptable to a range of conditions within its native temperate zone, tolerating both colder winters and warmer summers.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced granular or liquid fertilizer applied in early spring and again in mid-summer. Amending soil with organic compost annually can also provide sufficient nutrients.
