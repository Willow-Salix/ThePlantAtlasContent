## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America, specifically widespread across Canada, Alaska, and the northern United States, particularly in cool, moist regions. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Wetlands, Boreal Forest Margins, and Subarctic Moist Tundra/Meadows. Characterized by cold winters, moderate summers, and high moisture availability. |
| **☀️ Light** | Extrapolated light needs based on its native habitat in open wet meadows and bogs indicate a strong preference for full sun. It can tolerate partial shade, but robust growth is achieved with good light exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Extrapolated from its native habitat in marshes, wet meadows, and bogs, this plant requires consistently moist to wet soil. It can tolerate periodic inundation and should not be allowed to dry out. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wetland grass thrives in cool, moist conditions with full sun exposure. It demands consistently wet soil, even tolerating boggy environments, and benefits from moderate soil fertility. Ensuring constant moisture is the most critical aspect of its care.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extrapolated from its native wetland soils, which are often rich in organic matter, it requires moderate fertility. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring should be sufficient; heavy feeding is generally not necessary.
