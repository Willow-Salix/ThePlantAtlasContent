## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in consistently wet conditions, mimicking its native European wetland habitat. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil remains constantly moist or even submerged. It generally requires low to moderate fertilization if planted in adequately rich, organic soil.

### Fertilizer
