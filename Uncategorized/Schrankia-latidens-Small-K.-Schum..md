## Care Guide
Native to the humid subtropical regions of the southeastern US, this plant thrives in full to partial sun. It prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil and has low to moderate fertilization needs. Its habitat suggests it tolerates periods of heat and humidity while requiring regular moisture.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season may be beneficial, especially in nutrient-poor sandy soils.
