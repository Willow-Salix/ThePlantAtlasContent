## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (primarily southern Sierra Nevada foothills and Transverse Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland / Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. Native to open, exposed habitats, it thrives with at least 6-8 hours of direct, unfiltered sunlight daily. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires regular water during its first growing season to develop roots, then very little to no supplemental water during dry summers. Prefers well-drained soil and is prone to root rot in constantly wet conditions, especially during dormancy. |

## Care Guide
This California native thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, reflecting its Mediterranean chaparral origins. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal summer watering. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it can fix its own nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it likely fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil itself. Excessive fertilization, particularly nitrogen, can be detrimental. Lean to poor soils are generally preferred.
