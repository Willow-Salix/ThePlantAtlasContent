## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Australia (widespread, particularly eastern Australia) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Temperate Seasonal Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Shade. It thrives in open, sunny locations when emergent or submerged, but can tolerate some shade. |
| **Watering** | Maintain constant inundation or very moist soil. This plant naturally grows in temporary pools and wet banks, so it requires consistently wet conditions and can even be fully submerged. |

## Introduction
Marsilea is a genus of approximately 65 species of aquatic ferns of the family Marsileaceae. The name honours Italian naturalist Luigi Ferdinando Marsili (1656–1730).
These small plants are of unusual appearance and do not resemble common ferns. Common names include water clover and four-leaf clover because of the long-stalked leaves have four clover-like lobes and are either present above water or submerged. It is worth clarifying that these plants are not clovers.
The sporocarps of some Australian species are very drought-resistant, surviving up to 100 years in dry conditions. On wetting, the gelatinous interior of the sporocarp swells, splitting it and releasing a worm-like mass that carries sori, eventually leading to germination of spores and fertilization.

## Care Guide
Marsilea hirsuta requires consistently wet to submerged conditions, mimicking its native temporary pools and wet banks. Provide full sun to partial shade for optimal growth, and consider light to moderate fertilization to support its aquatic nature. Ensure stable water levels for best results.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. Benefits from nutrient-rich aquatic substrates or occasional liquid fertilizer suitable for aquatic plants, mimicking the nutrient content of its natural muddy habitats.
