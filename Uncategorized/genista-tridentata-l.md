## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Iberian Peninsula (Spain, Portugal) and Northwest Africa |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, unshaded scrublands. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; requires moderate watering during its active growing season (spring/early summer) and very little during hot, dry summer dormancy. Excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Genista  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae, native to open habitats such as moorland and pasture in Europe and western Asia. They include species commonly called broom, though the term may also refer to other genera, including Cytisus and Chamaecytisus. Brooms in other genera are sometimes considered synonymous with Genista: Echinospartum, Retama, Spartium, Stauracanthus, and Ulex.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native Mediterranean scrubland. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate water during spring and early summer growth, with minimal to no water needed during its summer dormancy. Fertilization should be minimal, especially nitrogen, due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; prefers lean to average soils. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so a low-nitrogen, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly in spring is sufficient if needed, or none at all in good soil.
