## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Andes Mountains (Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Grassland / Montane Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring high light exposure typical of mountain environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, adaptable to periods of drought. |

## Introduction
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## Care Guide
Festuca pallescens thrives in full sun with well-drained soil, mirroring its native high-altitude grasslands. It requires moderate to low watering, tolerating dry conditions, and benefits from minimal fertilization to prevent overgrowth in poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it originates from lean, rocky mountain soils. Fertilize sparingly in growing season.
