## Introduction
Ironwood is a common name for many woods that have a reputation for hardness, or specifically a wood density that is denser than water (approximately 1000 kg/m3, or 62 pounds per cubic foot), although usage of the name ironwood in English may or may not indicate a tree that yields such heavy wood.

## Care Guide
To care for this tropical ironwood, provide a warm, humid environment with consistent moisture and excellent drainage. Ensure ample sunlight, particularly as the tree matures, and supplement with a balanced fertilizer to support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer is beneficial during active growth, given the nutrient cycling in rainforest soils.
