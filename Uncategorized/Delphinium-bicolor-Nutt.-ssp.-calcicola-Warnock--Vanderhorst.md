## Introduction
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## Care Guide
Little Larkspur thrives in its native montane meadow conditions with full to partial sun and well-drained, alkaline soil. Provide moderate watering during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. Fertilization needs are low.

### Fertilizer
Low; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring, or none if grown in rich, well-draining soil. Prefers alkaline to neutral soil pH.
