## Care Guide
Foldedleaf Grass is a hardy savanna plant that demands full sun and is exceptionally drought-tolerant, preferring well-draining soil that dries out between waterings. It thrives with minimal fertilizer, making it a low-maintenance choice for warm, sunny environments.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer application once a year in spring is sufficient, or it may not require any additional feeding in suitable soils.
