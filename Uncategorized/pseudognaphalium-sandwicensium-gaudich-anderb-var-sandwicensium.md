## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian endemic 'Ena'ena is a hardy plant adapted to dry, exposed coastal and volcanic areas, demanding full sun and well-drained soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing to best replicate its natural, lean growing conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to None. Thrives in nutrient-poor soils like lava flows; excessive fertilization can be detrimental. A very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer once a year, or none at all, is ideal.
