## 🌱 Overview
Chenopodium is a genus of numerous species of perennial or annual herbaceous flowering plants known as the goosefoot, which occur almost anywhere in the world. It is placed in the family Amaranthaceae in the APG II system; older classification systems, notably the widely used Cronquist system, separate it and its relatives as Chenopodiaceae, but this leaves the rest of the Amaranthaceae polyphyletic. However, among the Amaranthaceae, the genus Chenopodium is the namesake member of the subfamily Chenopodioideae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Oblong-leaf Goosefoot thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, adapting well to conditions mimicking its native montane habitats. It requires low to moderate watering, being quite drought tolerant once established. Fertilization needs are minimal, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; it can thrive in relatively poor, disturbed soils. A single application of a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is usually sufficient, or none if grown in fertile soil.
