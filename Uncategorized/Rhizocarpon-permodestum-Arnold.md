## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including mountainous areas of Europe, North America, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure, often full sun, with tolerance for harsh UV radiation characteristic of high altitudes. |
| **Watering** | Frequent moisture from precipitation (rain, snowmelt, atmospheric humidity like fog and dew), but adapted to periodic desiccation. |

## Introduction
Rhizocarpon is a genus of crustose, saxicolous (or sometimes lichenicolous), lecideoid lichens in the family Rhizocarpaceae. The genus is common in arctic-alpine environments, but also occurs throughout temperate, subtropical, and even tropical regions. They are commonly known as map lichens because of the prothallus forming border-like bands between colonies in some species, like the common map lichen (Rhizocarpon geographicum).

## Care Guide
Rhizocarpon permodestum is an extremophile lichen thriving on exposed siliceous rocks in cold, high-altitude environments. It requires high light, cold temperatures, and periodic moisture, while being highly sensitive to air pollution and nutrient enrichment. Cultivation is generally impractical due to its specific environmental needs.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient requirements; sensitive to high levels of nitrogen and other pollutants, deriving nutrients primarily from air, rain, and rock surface.
