## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Western United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Montane Meadow / Semi-Arid Rangeland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low; water deeply when the top soil is dry, allowing for periods of dryness between waterings, especially mimicking natural seasonal droughts. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full to partial sun, mirroring its open grassland origins. Provide moderate to low watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions to prevent root issues, and it generally requires very little fertilization. Mimic a temperate grassland environment for best results.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically requires minimal fertilization. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in very poor soils, but generally not necessary.
