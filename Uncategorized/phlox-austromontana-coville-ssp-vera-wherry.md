## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Phlox subspecies thrives in conditions mimicking its arid montane native habitat. Provide full sun exposure and well-drained, lean soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to fully dry out between infrequent, deep waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to rot in consistently wet conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; thrives in lean, rocky, or sandy soils. Excessive fertilization can harm the plant.
