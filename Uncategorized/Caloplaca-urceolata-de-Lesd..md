## Introduction
Caloplaca is a lichen genus comprising a number of distinct species. Members of the genus are commonly called firedot lichen, jewel lichen. gold lichens, "orange lichens", but they are not always orange, as in the case of C. albovariegata. The distribution of this lichen genus is worldwide, extending from Antarctica to the high Arctic. It includes a portion of northern North America and the Russian High Arctic. There are about thirty species of Caloplaca in the flora of the British Isles.
A new species of Caloplaca, C. obamae, the first species to be named in honor of Barack Obama, was discovered in 2007 on Santa Rosa Island in California and published in March 2009.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in high sunlight on exposed surfaces, mimicking its native Mediterranean habitat. It requires infrequent periods of moisture from rain or dew, interspersed with dry spells, and does not need supplemental fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; lichens obtain nutrients from the air and substrate and do not require traditional fertilization.
