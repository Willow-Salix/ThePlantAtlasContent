## Care Guide
This tropical grass thrives in warm, humid conditions with abundant sunlight. Provide consistent moisture, allowing slight drying between waterings, and offer light fertilization during its growth phase. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose granular or liquid fertilizer during its active growing season (spring and summer) will support healthy growth.
