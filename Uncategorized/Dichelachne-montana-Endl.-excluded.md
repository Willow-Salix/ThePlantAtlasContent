| **Native Origin** | Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Grassland and Open Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, reflecting its natural exposure in open montane environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings, consistent with temperate regions with regular rainfall but well-drained soils. |

## Care Guide
This grass, though its specific name is no longer taxonomically accepted, likely thrives in conditions similar to temperate montane grasslands. It requires full sun to partial shade, moderate watering allowing for some dryness between waterings, and low to moderate fertilization to mimic its natural habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, primarily during the growing season, as native grasses in montane settings typically adapt to moderate soil fertility.
