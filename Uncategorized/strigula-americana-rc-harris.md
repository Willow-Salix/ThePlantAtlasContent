## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for American Strigula Lichen, provide a consistently high-humidity environment with frequent misting to mimic its native tropical and subtropical forest habitat. Ensure it receives low to indirect light, avoiding any direct sun exposure. As a lichen, it needs very little to no fertilization, as high nutrient levels can be harmful.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required. Lichens are highly sensitive to excessive nutrient levels, which can be detrimental; they primarily obtain nutrients from the air and precipitation.
