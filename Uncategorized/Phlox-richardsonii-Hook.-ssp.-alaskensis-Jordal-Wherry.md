## Introduction
Phlox (; Ancient Greek: φλόξ "flame"; plural "phlox" or "phloxes", Ancient Greek: φλόγες phlóges) is a genus of 68 species of perennial and annual plants in the family Polemoniaceae. They are found mostly in North America (one in Siberia) in diverse habitats from alpine tundra to open woodland and prairie. Some flower in spring, others in summer and fall. Flowers may be pale blue, violet, pink, bright red, or white. Many are fragrant.

## Care Guide
To mimic its native Arctic Tundra environment, Alaskan Phlox requires full sun and well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Water moderately during its short growing season, letting the soil dry out between applications, and apply fertilizer sparingly as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal. Native tundra soils are typically poor in nutrients, so heavy fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental.
