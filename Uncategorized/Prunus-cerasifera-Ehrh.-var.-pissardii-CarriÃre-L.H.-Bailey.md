| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest / Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) for best growth and leaf color, can tolerate some light partial shade. |

## Introduction
Prunus is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs from the family Rosaceae. The genus includes plums, cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots and almonds (collectively stonefruit). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, being native to the temperate regions of North America, the neotropics of South America, and temperate and tropical regions of Eurasia and Africa, There are about 340 accepted species as of March 2024.
Many members of the genus are widely cultivated for their sweet, fleshy fruit and for decorative purposes of their flowers. Prunus fruit are drupes, or stone fruits. The fleshy mesocarp surrounding the endocarp is edible while the endocarp itself forms a hard, inedible shell called the pyrena ("stone" or "pit"). This shell encloses the seed (or "kernel"), which is edible in some species (such as sweet almonds), but poisonous in many others (such as apricot kernels). Besides being eaten off the hand, most Prunus fruit  are also commonly used in processing, such as jam production, canning, drying, and the seeds for roasting.

## Care Guide
This adaptable temperate tree thrives in full sun with moderate watering, particularly when young. It prefers well-drained soil and benefits from a general-purpose fertilizer in spring to support its growth and vibrant foliage. Once established, it is quite hardy and low-maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; thrives in average to rich, well-drained soil. A balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring, particularly for young trees or those in poor soil.
