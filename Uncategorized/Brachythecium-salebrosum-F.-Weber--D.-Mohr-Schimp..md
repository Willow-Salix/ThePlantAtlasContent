## Care Guide
This adaptable moss thrives in consistently moist, humid environments with low to indirect light, mimicking its natural forest floor habitat. Ensure constant moisture without waterlogging and provide high ambient humidity. Fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Mosses absorb nutrients from water and air; excess nutrients can be detrimental.
