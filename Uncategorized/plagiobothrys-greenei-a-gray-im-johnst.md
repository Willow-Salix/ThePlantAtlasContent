## 🧤 Care Instructions
Greene's Popcornflower thrives in full sun with a specific watering regimen: abundant moisture during its winter/spring growing phase, followed by a dry summer dormancy. It adapts well to low to moderate nutrient soils, reflecting its native vernal pool habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient requirements; prefers lean to moderately rich soils, adapted to the naturally varying conditions of seasonal wetlands. Light, balanced fertilization is sufficient if cultivated.
