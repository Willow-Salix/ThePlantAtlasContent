## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America, specifically the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Freshwater Aquatic (Cool, flowing streams, rivers, and lakes). |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. Avoid strong direct sunlight which can promote algae growth and overheat the water. |
| **Watering** | Requires continuous submersion in cool, clean, oxygenated freshwater. Regular water changes (e.g., 25-50% weekly) are essential to maintain water quality and prevent nutrient build-up. |

## Introduction
Fontinalis is a genus of submerged aquatic mosses belonging to the subclass Bryidae. These mosses are also called willow moss, fountain moss, brook moss and water moss. The genus is widespread in the Northern Hemisphere and includes both species that occur in still water and in flowing water.

## Care Guide
New England Fontinalis Moss requires a stable aquatic environment with continuous submersion in cool, clean, oxygenated water. Provide low to moderate indirect light and perform regular water changes to maintain water quality, as it has minimal fertilization needs.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. This aquatic moss thrives on ambient nutrients in the water, often from fish waste or decaying organic matter. If grown in a sterile environment, very low doses of liquid aquatic plant fertilizer may be beneficial, but over-fertilization can lead to algae issues.
