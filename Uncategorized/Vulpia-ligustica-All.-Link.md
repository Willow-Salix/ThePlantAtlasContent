## Introduction
Vulpia is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family, native to many countries around the world and naturalized in many of the nations to which it is not native. It is most common in temperate regions.
Vulpia is a part of a group of species known as fescues; Vulpia is sometimes considered a subset of the main fescue genus, Festuca. Many of these fescues are considered noxious weeds in many places. Vulpia myuros is a notable weed.
The genus is named for Johann Samuel Vulpius (1760-1846), a German botanist.

## Care Guide
This Mediterranean annual grass thrives in full sun and well-draining soils, showing strong drought tolerance. It requires moderate watering during its active growth in cooler seasons, aligning with its native wet-winter, dry-summer climate. Minimal fertilization is needed for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils without the need for additional fertilization.
