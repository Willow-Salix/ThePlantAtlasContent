## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pacific Northwest, USA (Washington, Oregon) and Canada (British Columbia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coniferous Forest (epilithic on siliceous rocks) |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to high indirect light or partial sun. While found on exposed rocks, it benefits from the often-cloudy conditions and avoids scorching direct sun. |
| **Watering** | This lichen absorbs moisture from the air. It requires frequent exposure to high atmospheric humidity, mist, or rain, followed by periods of drying. No conventional watering. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
Lecidea washingtonensis thrives in a temperate, humid environment with good air circulation and moderate light exposure on a siliceous rock substrate. It requires frequent atmospheric moisture but must dry out between wetting events. Avoid direct watering and fertilization entirely.

### Fertilizer
No fertilization is required or recommended. Lichens derive nutrients from the air, dust, and minerals in their rock substrate, and are sensitive to chemical inputs.
