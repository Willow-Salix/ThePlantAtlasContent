## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dutilly's Sedge thrives in cold, wet, and open conditions characteristic of the Arctic Tundra. Provide consistently moist to wet soil and expose it to full or partial sun. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments, it requires only low to moderate fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, often acidic, tundra soils.
