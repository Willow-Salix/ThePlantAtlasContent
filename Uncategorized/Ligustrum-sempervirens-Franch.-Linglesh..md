## Introduction
A privet is a flowering plant in the genus Ligustrum. The genus contains about 50 species of erect, deciduous or evergreen shrubs or trees, with a native distribution from Europe to tropical and subtropical Asia, and with one species each native to Australia and north Africa. Some species have become widely naturalized or invasive where introduced. Privet was originally the name for the European semi-evergreen shrub Ligustrum vulgare, and later also for the more reliably evergreen Ligustrum ovalifolium and its hybrid Ligustrum × ibolium used extensively for privacy hedging, though now the name is applied to all members of the genus. The generic name was applied by Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD) to L. vulgare. It is often suggested that the name privet is related to private, but the Oxford English Dictionary states that there is no evidence to support this.

## Care Guide
This evergreen privet, originating from subtropical and warm temperate regions of East Asia, thrives in a range of light conditions from full sun to partial shade. It prefers moderately moist soil but is resilient to occasional dry spells once established. Minimal fertilization is typically required to maintain its health and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring is usually sufficient.
