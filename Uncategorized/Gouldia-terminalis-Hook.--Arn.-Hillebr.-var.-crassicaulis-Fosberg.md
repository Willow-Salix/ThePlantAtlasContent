## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native thrives in conditions mimicking its wet to mesic forest origin, requiring consistently moist, well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. High humidity is beneficial, and it appreciates moderate fertilization during its active growth period to support healthy foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Reduce feeding in fall and winter.
