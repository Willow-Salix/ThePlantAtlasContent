## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Pale Green Orchid thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil and prefers partial sun or dappled shade, mimicking its native temperate wetland habitats. It requires high humidity and minimal, highly diluted fertilizer to ensure healthy growth, always avoiding complete desiccation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Use a highly diluted balanced orchid fertilizer sparingly during the growing season, if at all, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.
