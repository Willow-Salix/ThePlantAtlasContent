## Care Guide
This adaptable native grass thrives in full to partial sun, typical of its open grassland habitat in the southeastern U.S. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and use a low to moderate fertilizer regimen. Its overall care is low-maintenance, reflecting its resilience in its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; as a native grass often found in less fertile or disturbed soils, it does not require heavy feeding. A light application of a balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial.
