## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, specifically Northeastern United States and adjacent Canada |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight for optimal flowering and fruit production, but can tolerate some afternoon shade. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained, especially during the first growing season. Established plants exhibit good drought tolerance, reflecting their adaptation to periods between rainfall in temperate forests. |

## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
Brainerd's Hawthorn var. Egglestonii thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring consistently moist, well-drained soil typical of temperate forest edges. Once established, it is moderately drought-tolerant. Fertilizer needs are generally low, with a balanced application beneficial only in nutrient-deficient soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. In its native temperate forest environment, nutrient recycling is efficient. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring if soil appears poor, but generally not a heavy feeder.
