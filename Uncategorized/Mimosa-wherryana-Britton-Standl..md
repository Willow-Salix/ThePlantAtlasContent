## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Puerto Rico |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is adapted to dry limestone hills and periods of drought. |

## Introduction
Mimosa is a genus of about 600 species of herbs and shrubs, in the mimosoid clade of the legume family Fabaceae. Species are native to the Americas, from North Dakota to northern Argentina, and to eastern Africa (Tanzania, Mozambique, and Madagascar) as well as the Indian subcontinent and Indochina. The generic name is derived from the Greek word μῖμος (mimos), 'actor' or 'mime', and the feminine suffix -osa, 'resembling', suggesting its 'sensitive leaves' which seem to 'mimic conscious life'.
Two species in the genus are especially notable. One is Mimosa pudica, commonly known as touch-me-not, which folds its leaves when touched or exposed to heat. It is native to southern Central and South America but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value, both as a houseplant in temperate areas, and outdoors in the tropics. Outdoor cultivation has led to weedy invasion in some areas, notably Hawaii. The other is Mimosa tenuiflora, which is best known for its use in shamanic ayahuasca brews due to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine found in its root bark.

## Care Guide
Wherry's Mimosa thrives in full sun and requires well-draining, nutrient-poor soil. Mimic its native tropical dry scrubland conditions by watering sparingly and allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings. Fertilization is generally not needed.

### Fertilizer
Low; this plant is accustomed to nutrient-poor soils such as serpentine and limestone. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, during its active growing season with a highly diluted solution.
