| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Dry Woodlands/Sandhills |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, bright conditions reminiscent of its native pine barrens and open woodlands. |

## Introduction
Phlox (; Ancient Greek: φλόξ "flame"; plural "phlox" or "phloxes", Ancient Greek: φλόγες phlóges) is a genus of 68 species of perennial and annual plants in the family Polemoniaceae. They are found mostly in North America (one in Siberia) in diverse habitats from alpine tundra to open woodland and prairie. Some flower in spring, others in summer and fall.

## Care Guide
Hentz's Phlox flourishes in full to partial sun with excellent drainage, mimicking its native sandhill and dry woodland habitats. Water moderately, letting the soil dry between sessions, and apply fertilizer sparingly as it is adapted to lean soil conditions. Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to lean, sandy soils. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial in very poor soils, but heavy fertilization is generally not needed.
