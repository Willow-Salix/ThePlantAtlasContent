## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern North America (eastern Canada and northeastern USA) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest / Boreal Forest (transitional zone) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, ideally with at least 6 hours of direct sun daily, reflecting its preference for forest edges and clearings. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is key; water regularly to keep soil evenly moist, especially during dry spells and in its first few years, as it's accustomed to regular rainfall. |

## Introduction
A birch is a thin-leaved deciduous hardwood tree of the genus Betula (), in the family Betulaceae, which also includes alders, hazels, and hornbeams. It is closely related to the beech-oak family Fagaceae. The genus Betula contains 30 to 60 known taxa of which 11 are on the IUCN 2011 Red List of Threatened Species. They are typically short-lived pioneer species and are widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in northern areas of temperate climates and in boreal climates. Birch wood is used for a wide range of purposes.

## Care Guide
The Big Blue Birch thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring a temperate climate. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and benefits from moderate fertilization in early spring. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry periods, to mimic its native forest environment.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, especially for young trees or in nutrient-poor soils, to support its growth in varied forest soils.
