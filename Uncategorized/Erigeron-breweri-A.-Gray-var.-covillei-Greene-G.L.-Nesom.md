## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (specifically the Transverse Ranges, South Coast Ranges, Sierra Nevada, Tehachapi Mountains) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane and Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun (thrives in open, exposed areas typical of montane forests and chaparral) |
| **Watering** | Low to Moderate; allow soil to dry out between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established due to its adaptation to dry summers in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Erigeron () is a large genus of plants in the composite family (Asteraceae). It is placed in the tribe Astereae and is closely related to the Old World asters (Aster) and the true daisies (Bellis). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and the highest diversity occurs in North America.

## Care Guide
Coville's Erigeron flourishes in full to partial sun with excellent drainage, mimicking its native California montane and chaparral environments. Once established, it is drought-tolerant and requires low to moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. Minimal or no fertilization is typically needed to ensure its health.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically not needed in native soils. If grown in very poor soil, a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
