## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal regions across North America (Atlantic and Pacific coasts), Europe, and parts of Asia (circumboreal distribution). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Coastal, specifically salt marshes, brackish areas, and maritime environments. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open coastal and marshland habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | High. Soil should be consistently moist to wet, mimicking tidal or frequently inundated conditions. It tolerates waterlogged soils and some salinity, but should not be allowed to dry out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Plantago is a genus of about 200 species of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae, commonly called plantains or fleaworts. The common name plantain is shared with the unrelated cooking plantain. Most are herbaceous plants, though a few are subshrubs growing to 60 centimetres (24 inches) tall.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rush Plantain thrives in full sun and consistently moist to wet, even saline, soil conditions, emulating its native coastal salt marsh habitat. This hardy plant requires low to moderate fertilization, preferring well-drained yet consistently hydrated environments to flourish.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Adaptable to nutrient-poor or saline soils; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once annually in spring is generally sufficient, or none if soil is naturally rich.
