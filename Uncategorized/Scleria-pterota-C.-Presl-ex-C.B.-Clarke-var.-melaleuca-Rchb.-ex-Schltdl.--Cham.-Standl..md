## Care Guide
Cortadora Blanca thrives in tropical, consistently moist to wet environments, favoring full sun to partial shade. Ensure its soil remains perpetually damp, and provide a balanced, diluted fertilizer during its active growth to support its robust, grass-like habit.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, balanced liquid fertilizer applied during the active growing season (spring and summer) at half strength. Not a heavy feeder if grown in naturally rich, wet soil.
