## Care Guide
Buffelgrass is an incredibly resilient plant best suited for full sun exposure, mimicking its native semi-arid savanna habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, demanding infrequent watering once established, and thrives with low to moderate nutrient input. This plant is ideal for xeriscaping or areas with limited water availability.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Adapts well to lean soils and does not require frequent feeding.
