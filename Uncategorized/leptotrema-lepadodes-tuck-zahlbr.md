# Leptotrema lepadodes
### *Leptotrema lepadodes (Tuck.) Zahlbr.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Humid forest regions across temperate to tropical zones, including parts of North America (e.g., Southeastern US), Central and South America, and East Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate to Subtropical Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate, indirect light. Thrives in shaded conditions, often on tree bark or rocks, away from direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high humidity and regular moisture. Benefits from frequent misting or high ambient humidity, allowing surfaces to dry slightly between hydration cycles, mimicking natural rainfall and dew. |

## 🌱 Overview
Leptotrema is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Graphidaceae. The genus has undergone significant taxonomic changes since its establishment in 1856, including being merged with other genera and later separated again based on molecular studies. Leptotrema lichens typically grow on bark or leaves and are characterized by their warted surface appearance and small, dark ascospores contained within immersed fruiting bodies. The genus currently includes 15 recognized species found in various tropical and subtropical regions.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in consistently humid, shaded environments. Provide low to moderate indirect light and maintain high ambient humidity through misting or a suitable humid microclimate. Avoid direct sun and chemical fertilizers, as it naturally acquires nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and rainwater; chemical fertilizers can be detrimental to their delicate symbiotic relationship.
