## Care Guide
San Joaquin Woollythread thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its native Mediterranean climate. Provide regular water from fall through spring during its active growth period, reducing irrigation as the plant completes its life cycle in late spring or early summer. Fertilization is generally not necessary.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to moderately fertile soil and generally does not require supplemental fertilization.
