# Hornwort
### *Anthoceros polymorphus Raddi var. punctatus (L.) Hampe*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Cosmopolitan; widespread across temperate and subtropical regions globally, including North America, Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa and Australasia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Moist Environments, often found in damp fields, disturbed soil, stream banks, and forest edges. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light; requires consistent shade or dappled light, mimicking its natural habitat beneath taller vegetation or in consistently overcast conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist; requires high humidity and frequent watering to prevent desiccation, similar to its native damp soil and stream-side habitats. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hornworts are a group of non-vascular Embryophytes (land plants) constituting the division Anthocerotophyta (). The common name refers to the elongated horn-like structure, which is the sporophyte. As in mosses and liverworts, hornworts have a gametophyte-dominant life cycle, in which cells of the plant carry only a single set of genetic information; the flattened, green plant body of a hornwort is the gametophyte stage of the plant.
Hornworts may be found worldwide, though they tend to grow only in places that are damp or humid. Some species grow in large numbers as tiny weeds in the soil of gardens and cultivated fields. Large tropical and sub-tropical species of Dendroceros may be found growing on the bark of trees.
The total number of species is still uncertain. While there are more than 300 published species names, the actual number could be as low as 100–150 species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hornwort thrives in consistently moist, shaded conditions with high humidity, much like its native damp field and forest edge environments. It requires minimal direct light and very infrequent fertilization. The key to successful care is maintaining a continuously wet substrate and humid air.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; typically obtains sufficient nutrients from its substrate and environmental moisture, thriving in nutrient-poor to moderately rich soils.
