## Introduction
Sabatia, the rose gentians, is a genus of about 20 species of flowering plants in the family Gentianaceae, native to eastern and central North America (Nova Scotia west to Wisconsin and New Mexico, and south to Florida and Texas), Central America, and the Caribbean.
They are annual or perennial herbaceous plants growing to 10–130 cm tall, with opposite leaves. The flowers are produced in large cymes at the top of the stems; the flower corolla has 5–12 lobes, colored pink or white, with a contrasting central yellow 'eye'. The fruit is a capsule containing numerous small seeds.

## Care Guide
To care for Slender Rose Gentian, provide full sun and consistently wet, acidic, nutrient-poor soil, replicating its native bog habitat. Ensure high humidity and never allow the soil to dry out to support its moisture-loving nature.

### Fertilizer
Prefers lean, acidic, and nutrient-poor soils. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, as heavy feeding can be detrimental.
