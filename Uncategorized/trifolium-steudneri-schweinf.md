## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | East Africa, including Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and DR Congo. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers areas with good light exposure, typical of open grasslands and high-altitude environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to frequent watering. Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained, reflecting its native habitat in moist grasslands and highlands with regular rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Steudner's Clover thrives in conditions mimicking its East African montane grassland origin, preferring full sun to partial shade. Ensure consistent moisture in well-drained soil, avoiding waterlogging. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires only light to moderate fertilization, focusing on balanced nutrients rather than high nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen fertilizer is unnecessary. A balanced fertilizer or one higher in phosphorus and potassium can be applied lightly during the growing season.
