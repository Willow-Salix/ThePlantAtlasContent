## Introduction
Deathcamas or death camas refer to several species of flowering plant in the tribe Melanthieae. The name alludes to the great similarity of appearance between these toxic plants, which were formerly classified together in the genus Zigadenus, and the edible camases (Camassia), with which they also often share habitat. Other common names for these plants include deadly zigadene, hog potato and mystery-grass.

## Care Guide
Deathcamas are resilient plants requiring full sun to partial shade and excellent drainage to prevent rot. Water moderately during their spring growing season, then allow the soil to become completely dry for their summer dormancy. Avoid rich soils and excessive nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements. Prefers lean, well-drained soils and does not tolerate overly rich conditions or heavy fertilization.
