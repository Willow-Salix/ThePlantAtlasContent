## 🧤 Care Instructions
Prairie goldenrod thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its native grassland environment. It requires moderate watering, becoming drought-tolerant once established, and benefits from minimal fertilization to prevent leggy growth. This hardy plant is well-suited for naturalized areas and meadows.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires minimal fertilization. In its native prairie environment, soil fertility is moderate. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring or a layer of compost is sufficient, especially in poorer soils. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to weak stems.
