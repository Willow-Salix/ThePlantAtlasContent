## Introduction
Lippia is a genus of flowering plants in the verbena family, Verbenaceae. It was named after Augustin Lippi (1678–1705), a French naturalist and botanist (with Italian origins). He was killed in Abyssinia. The genus contains roughly 200 species of tropical shrubs that are found around the world. Plants are fragrant due to their essential oils, which vary between species but may include estragole, carvacrol, linalool or limonene. The leaves of certain species, such as L. graveolens, can be used as a culinary herb similar to oregano.

## Care Guide
Montevideo Lippia is a robust and adaptable plant that thrives in full to partial sun exposures. It prefers moderate watering with well-draining soil, showing good drought tolerance once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, making it a low-maintenance option for various garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is usually sufficient. Avoid over-fertilizing, especially in naturally rich soils.
