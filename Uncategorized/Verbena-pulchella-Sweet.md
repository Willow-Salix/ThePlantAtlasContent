## 🌱 Overview
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun conditions, much like its native open pampas environment, and prefers well-draining soil with moderate to low watering, becoming drought-tolerant once established. It is not a heavy feeder, requiring minimal fertilization. Provide ample light and avoid overwatering for best performance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, a balanced slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring should suffice. Over-fertilization can reduce flowering.
