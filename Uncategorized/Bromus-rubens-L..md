## Care Guide
Red Brome is an annual grass adapted to the Mediterranean's hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It requires full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, thriving in poor to moderate soils without significant fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant suited for dry, sunny environments.
