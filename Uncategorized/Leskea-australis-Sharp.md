## 🧤 Care Instructions
Leskea Moss thrives in consistently moist, humid conditions with low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native temperate forest habitat. Avoid direct sunlight and ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Fertilization is typically not required due to their adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; mosses are adapted to nutrient-poor environments and excessive nutrients can be harmful.
