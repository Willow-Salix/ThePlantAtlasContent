## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Cape Provinces, South Africa |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers (winter rainfall region/Fynbos biome). |
| **Sunlight** | Requires bright light to full sun during its active growing season (winter and spring). Protection from intense afternoon summer sun may be beneficial in very hot regions. |
| **Watering** | Water regularly during the active growth period (winter and spring), allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce watering significantly or cease entirely during summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Lachenalia is a genus of bulbous perennial plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Scilloideae, which are usually found in Namibia and South Africa. Most of them have a dormancy period, but new roots will always grow every year.
Lachenalia is named after the Swiss botanist Werner de Lachenal (1736-1800). Species are sometimes known as Cape cowslip, though they are not even somewhat related to the true cowslip Primula veris.

## Care Guide
Lachenalia are winter-growing bulbs native to South Africa's Mediterranean climate. Provide bright light and regular watering during their active winter to spring growth. Allow them to go dormant in summer by withholding water, mimicking their natural dry season.

### Fertilizer
Feed sparingly with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer or a bulb-specific fertilizer (higher in phosphorus) every 2-4 weeks during active growth. Do not fertilize during dormancy.
