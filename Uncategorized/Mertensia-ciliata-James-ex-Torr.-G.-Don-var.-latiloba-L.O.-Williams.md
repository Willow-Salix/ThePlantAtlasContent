## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically mountainous regions from Alaska and western Canada south through the Rocky Mountains to Arizona and New Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Meadow and Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers some afternoon shade in warmer regions or at lower elevations to protect from intense sun. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimic its native streambank and moist meadow habitats by watering frequently, ensuring soil never dries out completely. |

## Introduction
Mertensia is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family Boraginaceae. They are perennial herbaceous plants with blue or sometimes white flowers that open from pink-tinged buds. Such a change in flower color is common in Boraginaceae and is caused by changes in soil pH. Mertensia is one of several plants that are commonly called "bluebell". In spite of their common name, the flowers are usually salverform (trumpet-shaped) rather than campanulate (bell-shaped).
Mertensia is native to most of North America and to a large part of Asia from western China to northeastern Russia. Its center of diversity is in the Rocky Mountains. Mertensia is mostly restricted to alpine, subalpine, and montane habitats. Notable exceptions are Mertensia maritima, a maritime plant of Arctic and subarctic coastlines, and Mertensia virginica, which is found from the Appalachian Mountains west to Minnesota, Iowa, and Missouri. Most of the species are endemic to very small areas of the Rocky Mountains.
Mertensia virginica has the largest flowers in the genus and is commonly cultivated. It is sparingly naturalized in Europe. About 12 other species are known in cultivation. The Inuit ate the rhizomes of Mertensia maritima.
Many of the species of Mertensia are hard to distinguish and some are possibly cryptic. Around 150 species names have been published in Mertensia. Most authors have recognized about 45 species, but in 2014, the authors of a molecular phylogenetic study recommended the acceptance of at least 62.

## Care Guide
To care for this Mountain Bluebell, provide a cool environment with full sun to partial shade, mimicking its subalpine origins. Maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, and offer light fertilization in spring. Protect from excessive heat and drought.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Thrives in moderately rich, organic soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if soil is naturally rich in organic matter.
