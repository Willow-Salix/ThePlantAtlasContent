## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States, particularly the Southern Appalachian Mountains (e.g., North Carolina, Tennessee) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest, often found in moist riparian zones within this biome |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sun for optimal flowering and fruiting) |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to consistent moisture. Prefers consistently moist soil, especially in well-drained areas, reflective of its riparian native habitat. Avoid prolonged drought or waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hawthorn thrives in temperate climates with full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil, typical of its native Appalachian riverine habitats. Provide moderate watering to maintain soil moisture and apply light fertilization for robust growth and fruit production.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, especially in poor soils. Established plants are generally not heavy feeders.
