## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in cool temperatures and bright light, preferring full sun exposure. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil during its active growth but is sensitive to waterlogging. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Native soils are typically nutrient-poor, so excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
