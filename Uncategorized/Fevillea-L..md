| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Can tolerate some morning sun but should be protected from harsh afternoon sun. |

## Introduction
Fevillea is a genus of the plant family Cucurbitaceae (the cucumber, squash, and pumpkin family). Some references suggest that there is only one member of this genus, Fevillea cordifolia (antidote vine).  Other online sources make reference to Fevillea pedatifolia (formerly Fevillea peruviana), Fevillea trilobata, and to Fevillea passiflora.
The genus is named after the French botanist Louis Feuillée.
Fevillea consists of dioecious vines or lianas. Two subgenera exist: Fevillea and Anisosperma. It is native to the Neotropics.

## Care Guide
Fevillea, a tropical vine, thrives in conditions mimicking its native moist broadleaf forests. It requires bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide regular fertilization during its growing period to support robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., NPK 10-10-10) every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
