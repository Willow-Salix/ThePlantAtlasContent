| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in exposed, bright conditions characteristic of its native treeline and tundra habitats. |

## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
To care for the Rockdwelling Sedge, provide full to partial sun exposure and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained, replicating its cool, alpine origins. It requires very little to no fertilizer and prefers cool temperatures with good air circulation.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils found in its native habitat. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
