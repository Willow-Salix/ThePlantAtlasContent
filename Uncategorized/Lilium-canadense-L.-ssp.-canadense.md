| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest (often in moist meadows, bogs, swamps, and open woodlands within this biome) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun in cooler, consistently moist climates, or partial shade (especially afternoon shade) in warmer regions. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil; requires frequent watering, especially during dry spells, to mimic its native habitat along stream banks and wet meadows. |

## Introduction
Lilium canadense, commonly called the Canada lily, wild yellow-lily, or meadow lily, is a native of eastern North America. Its native range extends from Ontario to Nova Scotia south to Georgia and Alabama. It is most common in New England, the Appalachian Mountains, and the Canadian Maritimes. It is also cultivated as an ornamental in Europe and other places.
Flowers emerge in June. They are nodding (hanging downward), yellow, orange or red, often with darker spots. The plant has become less common in urban and suburban areas due to heavy browsing by the white-tailed deer.

## Care Guide
The Canada Lily thrives in consistently moist, organically rich soil, mirroring its native wetland and open woodland habitats. It prefers full sun in cooler climates or partial shade in warmer areas, where afternoon shade is beneficial. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry periods, to prevent the soil from drying out completely.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to rich soil; benefits from organically rich soil, such as compost or well-rotted manure, applied annually in spring.
