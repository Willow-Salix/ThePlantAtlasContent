## Care Guide
To mimic its native Palauan rainforest environment, this plant requires high humidity, consistently moist soil, and bright, indirect light. Protect it from direct sun and fertilize moderately during the active growing season for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength.
