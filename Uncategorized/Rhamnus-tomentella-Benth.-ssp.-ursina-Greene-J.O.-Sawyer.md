## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant shrub thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil typical of Mediterranean chaparral. Once established, it requires infrequent deep watering during dry spells and generally needs no fertilization. Over-watering and excessive fertilizer should be avoided.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally not required. May benefit from a light, balanced native plant fertilizer in very poor soils, but avoid over-fertilization.
