## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western Europe (particularly United Kingdom, Ireland, France) and Macaronesia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Oceanic (e.g., Atlantic woodlands) |
| **☀️ Light** | Filtered light to partial shade; prefers well-lit situations within a woodland canopy, avoiding direct intense sun. |
| **💧 Water** | High atmospheric humidity is essential, receiving moisture from frequent rainfall, mist, and dew. It does not require root watering as it's a lichen that absorbs water directly from the environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pertusaria is a large genus of warty crustose lichens in the Pertusariaceae family. The fruiting bodies are usually modified apothecia that immersed in warts on the main body (thallus) with small holes for the spores to emerge, similar to ostioles, or are fully above and lecanorine (spore bearing discs surrounded by a ring of tissue similar to the tissue of the thallus.  Members of the genus are commonly called wart lichens.
The widespread genus contains over 500 species.
Classification in the large genus relies heavily on thallus chemistry to distinguish and classify species, some of which differ only in the presence or absence of a single secondary chemical. Lichexanthone, norlichexanthone, and their chlorinated derivatives are common in this genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pertusaria microsticta, a lichen, thrives in humid, temperate oceanic environments with filtered light. Its care primarily involves ensuring high ambient humidity and avoiding direct sunlight, as it absorbs water and nutrients directly from the atmosphere and substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No conventional fertilizer is needed. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rain) and the bark of their host trees.
