| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Scandinavia, the Alps, the Pyrenees, Greenland, Arctic Canada, Alaska, and the Rocky Mountains. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Arctic Tundra, often found in moist, calcareous flushes, rocky stream banks, and gravelly slopes. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright light exposure, typical of its open alpine and arctic habitats. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but extremely well-drained conditions. It naturally grows in areas with reliable moisture from meltwater or seeps, but never waterlogged. |

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in bright, open conditions and requires consistently moist, yet exceptionally well-drained soil, mimicking its native rocky, meltwater-fed environments. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, mineral-rich substrates.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Native soils are typically lean and mineral-rich, so over-fertilization can be detrimental. A very dilute, balanced fertilizer might be applied once in spring for potted specimens, but is often unnecessary.
