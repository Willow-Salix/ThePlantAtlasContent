## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal and interior California (USA), Baja California (Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it typically grows in open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the active growing season (winter-spring) to mimic native rainfall. Allow soil to dry between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring very little or no supplemental water during dry summers. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Hasse's Vetch thrives in full sun and well-draining soils, typical of its native Mediterranean climate. It requires moderate watering during its active winter-spring growth, then becomes drought-tolerant for the dry summer months. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has very low fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil itself. Supplemental fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental, especially high nitrogen.
