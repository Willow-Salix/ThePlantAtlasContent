## Introduction
Ugni molinae, commonly known as Chilean guava berry, or strawberry myrtle, is a shrub native to Chile and adjacent regions of southern Argentina. The local Spanish name is murta, and the Mapuche Native American name is "uñi". It is in the same botanical family as the guava, in Myrtaceae.
The fruit is sometimes marketed as "Ugniberry", as "New Zealand cranberry" in New Zealand, and the name "Tazziberry" has been trademarked in Australia, but it is not a native plant to these countries.

## Care Guide
Ugni Turcz. thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its temperate rainforest origins. Regular watering and moderate fertilization support healthy growth. It is relatively easy to care for, provided its moisture and light needs are met.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced slow-release fertilizer or organic compost, especially during the active growing season.
