## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of Europe, North America, and parts of Asia, typically in peatlands, heathlands, and on decaying wood. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Boreal Bog/Heathland |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers indirect or filtered light conditions, avoiding direct harsh sun. Tolerates partial shade, often found in sheltered, humid microclimates. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and a moist environment, but not waterlogged. Frequent misting or placement in a humid microclimate (like a terrarium) is crucial to prevent desiccation, as lichens absorb moisture directly from the air. |

## Introduction
Micarea is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Pilocarpaceae. The widely distributed genus contains 142 species and new species are described actively. Species in the genus are crustose lichens and their photobiont (the non-fungal organism) is a single-celled green alga.

## Care Guide
The Dot Lichen thrives in cool, humid, and well-ventilated conditions with indirect to filtered light, mimicking its native bog and heathland habitats. Ensure a consistently moist environment through high atmospheric humidity and avoid any direct fertilization, as this sensitive organism can be harmed by nutrient salts.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required or recommended. Lichens derive necessary trace nutrients from the atmosphere and rainfall; synthetic fertilizers can be highly detrimental.
