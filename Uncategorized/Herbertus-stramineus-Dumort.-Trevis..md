## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in cool, consistently humid environments with low, indirect light and a constantly moist, acidic substrate. Avoid direct sun and ensure high ambient humidity, as drying out is detrimental. Fertilization should be kept to an absolute minimum or avoided entirely.

### Fertilizer
Very minimal to no fertilizer is needed, as it naturally thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic environments. If fertilizing, use an extremely diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly, perhaps once a year.
