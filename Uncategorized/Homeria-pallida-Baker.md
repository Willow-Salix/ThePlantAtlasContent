## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and requires specific watering, aligning with its Mediterranean climate by receiving ample water in winter/spring and entering a dry dormancy in summer. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, thus needing only minimal fertilization to flourish.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires minimal fertilization; a single application of a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer during its active growing season (winter/spring) is sufficient due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.
