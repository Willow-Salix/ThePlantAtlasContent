## Care Guide
California Goldenbanner thrives in sunny, well-drained locations, mirroring its native Mediterranean climate of California. It prefers moderate water during its active growth in spring, becoming quite drought-tolerant once established and requiring infrequent watering during dry summers.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. Supplemental fertilizer is generally not needed.
