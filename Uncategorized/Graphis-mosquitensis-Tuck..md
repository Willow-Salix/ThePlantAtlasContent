## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in conditions of very high humidity and consistent, indirect light, reflecting its natural tropical rainforest habitat. Provide a damp, but well-ventilated environment and avoid any chemical fertilizers, as they are detrimental.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required or recommended. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and rainfall, and chemical fertilizers can be harmful.
