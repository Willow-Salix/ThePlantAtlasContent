## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Northern Europe, including Great Britain, Germany, Austria, and Scandinavia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests, specifically in sheltered, humid microclimates within old-growth forests. |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect to low light; as an epiphytic lichen growing on tree bark, it thrives in shaded, sheltered conditions beneath a forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity and regular moisture absorption from rain or mist; requires consistently moist air rather than direct 'watering' of a substrate. |

## Introduction
Bacidia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. These lichens are characterised by their crustose growth form, distinctive club-shaped reproductive structures called apothecia that contain long, needle-like spores, and their symbiotic partnership with green algae. Bacidia species typically grow on various substrates including tree bark, rock surfaces, and occasionally soil, and are distinguished from related genera by their specific spore characteristics and internal structures.

## Care Guide
This lichen requires a stable, highly humid environment with indirect or low light, typical of sheltered old-growth temperate forests. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere and its substrate, making external watering or fertilization unnecessary. Maintaining an unpolluted, high-humidity microclimate is paramount for its well-being.

### Fertilizer
No fertilization required; lichens obtain necessary nutrients directly from the substrate (e.g., tree bark) and airborne particles in unpolluted environments.
