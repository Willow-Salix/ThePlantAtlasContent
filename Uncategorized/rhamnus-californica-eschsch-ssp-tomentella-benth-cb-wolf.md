## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hoary Coffeeberry thrives in a Mediterranean climate with full sun exposure and well-draining soil. It is very drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization. This resilient shrub is well-suited to gardens replicating its native chaparral environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally low fertilizer needs. Can benefit from a light, balanced native plant fertilizer in spring if soil is very poor, but often thrives without it.
