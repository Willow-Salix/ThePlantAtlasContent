## Care Guide
This aquatic moss requires constant submersion or consistently saturated conditions, mimicking its natural habitat in streams and rivers. It prefers partial to full shade, avoiding direct intense sunlight, and needs very little to no supplemental fertilization as it absorbs nutrients from its water source.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; naturally obtains sufficient nutrients directly from its water environment
