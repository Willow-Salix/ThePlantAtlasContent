## Care Guide
This California native thrives in full sun and dry conditions, mimicking its chaparral habitat. Provide infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between applications, and avoid over-fertilization as it is adapted to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. If desired, a very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
