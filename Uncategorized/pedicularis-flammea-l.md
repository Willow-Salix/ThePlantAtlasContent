## 🧤 Care Instructions
To cultivate Red Rattle, provide full to partial sun exposure and maintain consistently moist, well-drained, and often acidic soil, mimicking its native tundra habitat. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum as the plant is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. Good drainage is crucial to prevent root issues, particularly in cooler climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, often acidic soils. Heavy fertilization should be avoided as it can be detrimental.
