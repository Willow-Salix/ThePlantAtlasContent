## Introduction
Adiantum (), the maidenhair fern (not to be confused with the similar-looking maidenhair spleenwort fern), is a genus of about 250 species of ferns in the subfamily Vittarioideae of the family Pteridaceae, though some researchers place it in its own family, Adiantaceae. The genus name comes from Greek, meaning "unwetted", referring to the fronds' ability to shed water without becoming wet.

## Care Guide
This tropical fern thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil and high humidity, mimicking its native rainforest understory. Protect it from direct sunlight and feed sparingly during the growing months to ensure lush, healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Apply a diluted liquid fertilizer (half-strength) monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer); reduce or cease in fall and winter.
