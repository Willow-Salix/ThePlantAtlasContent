## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (California, Oregon, Nevada, Idaho) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Semi-Arid Grassland/Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, mimicking its native semi-arid grassland environment. It requires infrequent watering, being highly drought-tolerant, and has very low fertilizer needs, adapting well to poor nutrient soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean soils and generally does not require significant fertilization. A light, balanced feed once a year in spring may be beneficial in very poor soils.
