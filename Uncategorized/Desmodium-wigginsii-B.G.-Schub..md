| **Native Origin** | Andes Mountains of South America, specifically in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright indirect light to partial sun, mimicking the dappled light of its native forest understory or clearings. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Water regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, especially during active growth. |

## Introduction
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. Species are distributed widely – from Quebec to northern Argentina in the Americas, across northern and southern tropical Africa, in the southern Arabian Peninsula, in Myanmar and Thailand, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia.

## Care Guide
This Andean native thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical montane forest home. Provide bright indirect light to partial sun and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil. Fertilize lightly during the growing season to support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season (e.g., once a month). As a legume, it may have reduced nitrogen needs due to nitrogen fixation.
