## Care Guide
This wetland sedge requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, even tolerating standing water. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and benefits from light to moderate fertilization during its active growth period to support its vigorous nature.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season. While wetland soils can be organically rich, excessive feeding is not typically necessary for sedges.
