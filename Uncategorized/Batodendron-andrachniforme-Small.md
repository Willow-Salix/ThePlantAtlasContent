## Introduction
Vaccinium  vack-SIN-ee-əm is a common and widespread genus of shrubs or dwarf shrubs in the heath family (Ericaceae). The fruits of many species are eaten by humans and some are of commercial importance, including the cranberry, blueberry, bilberry (whortleberry), lingonberry (cowberry), and huckleberry. Like many other heath plants, they are restricted to acidic soils.

## Care Guide
This subtropical plant thrives in bright, indirect light with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimicking its native pineland habitat, it benefits from moderate humidity and light fertilization during active growth, while being protected from intense afternoon sun.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer).
