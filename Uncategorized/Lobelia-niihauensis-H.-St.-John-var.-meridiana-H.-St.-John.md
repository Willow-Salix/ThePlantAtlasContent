## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native dry, exposed cliffs. Provide full sun exposure and allow the soil to dry thoroughly between very infrequent waterings. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum due to its adaptation to poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; native to nutrient-poor rocky soils, so light feeding (if any) with a balanced, diluted fertilizer once a year is sufficient.
