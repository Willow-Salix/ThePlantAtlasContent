# Pseudobraunia Moss

*Pseudobraunia (Lesq. & James) Broth.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (USA: California, Oregon, Washington) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Semi-Arid Shrubland/Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun, often found in open, exposed areas. Avoid intense, scorching afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Allow substrate to dry completely between waterings, as it's adapted to dry rocks and periods of drought. Avoid constant saturation or waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
Pseudobraunia moss thrives in bright, open conditions with excellent air circulation, requiring the substrate to dry out completely between waterings. It has very low nutrient needs, mimicking its native habitat on dry, exposed rocks in Western North America.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. If fertilized, use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 strength or less) once annually during active growth, reflecting its nutrient-poor native habitat.
