## Care Guide
The Coast Banksia requires full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native coastal environment. Once established, it is relatively drought-tolerant but benefits from occasional watering during dry spells. Avoid high-phosphorus fertilizers to ensure its health.

### Fertilizer
Requires low-phosphorus fertilizer, ideally formulated for Australian native plants, as high phosphorus levels can be detrimental. In many soils, no fertilizer may be needed.
