## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Endemic to Inyo County, California, USA, specifically the Tecopa area |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland (Mojave Desert) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. This plant thrives in direct, intense sunlight typical of its desert native habitat, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sun daily. |
| **Watering** | Very low. Mimic desert conditions by allowing the soil to dry out completely between infrequent waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to root rot if overwatered. |

## Introduction
Cordylanthus (lit. 'club-flower'), commonly known as bird's beaks, is a genus of parasitic plants in the broomrape family, Orobanchaceae. These western North American natives are sparse, weedy-looking annuals with long branching erect stems and little foliage, and many bear bird's-beak–shaped flowers. They are remarkable among the broomrapes for growing at searing temperatures in arid climates.

## Care Guide
Tecopa Bird's Beak requires full sun exposure and is exceptionally drought-tolerant, needing very infrequent watering to thrive. It should be grown in well-draining soil with minimal to no fertilizer, reflecting its adaptation to arid desert environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Native desert soils are generally nutrient-poor, so this plant is not adapted to rich conditions. Heavy fertilization can be detrimental.
