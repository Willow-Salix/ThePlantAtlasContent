## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pacific Northwest of North America (USA, Canada), specifically coastal regions. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforest / Coastal Humid Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Filtered to indirect bright light, emulating its natural habitat growing epiphytically on trees; direct harsh sun should be avoided. |
| **Watering** | As a lichen, it absorbs moisture from the air and rain. It requires consistently high humidity and regular exposure to mist or clean rainfall, sensitive to dry conditions. |

## Introduction
Bryoria is a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. Many members of this genus are known as horsehair lichens. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in boreal and cool temperate areas. These lichens typically grow as slender, hair-like strands that hang from conifer trees or form small bushes, ranging in colour from dark brown to pale grey. They play important ecological roles, particularly as winter food for caribou in northern forests, where some species can accumulate in large quantities in the forest canopy. The genus contains about 35 species found worldwide, with ongoing discoveries of new species especially in mountainous regions of Asia and western North America.

## Care Guide
This is a lichen, not a typical plant, requiring specific environmental conditions rather than soil care. Provide very high humidity, consistently moist air, and indirect bright light, ensuring excellent air quality. Traditional watering or fertilizing methods are inappropriate and can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is needed or recommended, as lichens obtain their nutrients from atmospheric dust and rainfall; chemical fertilizers can be harmful.
