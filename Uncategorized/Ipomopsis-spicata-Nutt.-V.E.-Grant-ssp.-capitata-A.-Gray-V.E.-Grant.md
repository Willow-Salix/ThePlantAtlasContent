## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (including Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Steppe / Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6-8+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed environments with little to no canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; infrequent, deep watering once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions to mimic natural low rainfall patterns. |

## Care Guide
Spiked Ipomopsis thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, typical of its arid native climate. It requires minimal watering, being highly drought-tolerant, and does not need regular fertilization. The overall care strategy is to replicate its dry, open, and nutrient-poor natural habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Adapted to lean, often rocky or sandy soils with minimal nutrient content.
