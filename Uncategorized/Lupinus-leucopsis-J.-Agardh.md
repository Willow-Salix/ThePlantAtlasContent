| **Native Origin** | Western North America (including Oregon, Washington, Idaho, California, Nevada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Dry Shrubland/Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and flowering; tolerates some light afternoon shade. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water regularly for young plants to ensure establishment; mature plants require infrequent watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between watering sessions. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Whitewoolly Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring temperate dry conditions. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal watering and no high-nitrogen fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it a low-maintenance plant for appropriate climates.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in poor to moderately fertile soil and does not need supplemental nitrogen. Excess nitrogen can hinder flowering.
