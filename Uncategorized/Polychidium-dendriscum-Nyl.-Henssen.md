| **Native Origin** | Pacific Northwest (USA, Canada), Western Europe (e.g., Scotland, Norway) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to partial indirect light; avoid direct, intense sunlight which can cause desiccation. |

## Introduction
Polychidium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Massalongiaceae. These lichens form tiny, shrub-like tufts with branching filaments that create woolly cushions on moss-covered rocks and tree twigs. The genus was traditionally thought to include four similar-looking species, but molecular studies revealed that three of these actually belong to a different genus called Leptogidium. Today, Polychidium in the strict sense contains only P. muscicola and three closely related species, found from tropical to subarctic regions worldwide.

## Care Guide
To care for this lichen, replicate its native cool, humid, and shaded temperate rainforest habitat. Ensure consistent moisture through frequent misting and high ambient humidity, protecting it from direct sunlight and any harsh chemicals.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers. Obtains necessary nutrients from the air, rainwater, and substrate.
