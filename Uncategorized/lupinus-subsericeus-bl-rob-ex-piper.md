## 🧤 Care Instructions
Silky Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soil, requiring minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Water moderately during its active growth period, then reduce frequency as it establishes drought tolerance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, especially nitrogen. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.
