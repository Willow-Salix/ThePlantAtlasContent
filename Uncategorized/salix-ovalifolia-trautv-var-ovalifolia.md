## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic North America (Alaska, Canada), Eastern Siberia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. This low-growing species in open tundra is exposed to long hours of daylight during its short growing season. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil, replicating the saturated conditions from melting snow and permafrost in its native boggy habitats. Does not tolerate drying out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Oval-Leaf Willow thrives in full sun to partial sun and demands consistently moist to wet soil, replicating its native boggy tundra environment. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, it has low fertilizer needs. Ensure it never dries out and provide conditions that mimic a cold, wet, exposed landscape.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Tundra soils are naturally nutrient-poor with slow decomposition rates. Use a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly, or incorporate light organic amendments if needed.
