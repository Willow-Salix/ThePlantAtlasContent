## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Indian subcontinent (primarily India and Pakistan) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid and Semi-Arid Tropical/Subtropical regions |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth) |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently but deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly susceptible to root rot in waterlogged conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Vigna aconitifolia is a drought-resistant legume, commonly grown in arid and semi-arid regions of India. It is commonly called mat bean, moth bean, matki or dew bean.
Moth bean is a creeping annual herbaceous plant which grows to approximately 40 centimetres (16 in) high. Yellow flowers on its hairy and densely packed branches develop into yellow-brown pods, 2 to 3 inches in length. The seeds of these pods contain approximately 22–24% protein.
The pods, sprouts and protein-rich seeds of this crop are commonly consumed in India. Moth bean can be grown on many soil types, and can also act as a pasture legume. Due to its drought-resistant qualities, its ability to combat soil erosion and its high protein content, moth bean has been identified as possibly a more significant food source in the future. It has been suggested that its suitability as a grain legume in semi-arid Africa should be further investigated.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Moth Bean thrives in hot, sunny environments with well-draining soil, reflecting its native arid and semi-arid climate. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and benefits from minimal nitrogen fertilization due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nitrogen requirements due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. May benefit from moderate phosphorus and potassium application, particularly in nutrient-poor soils.
