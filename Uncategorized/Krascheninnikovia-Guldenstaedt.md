## 🧤 Care Instructions
Winterfat requires care that mimics its native arid scrubland environment, thriving in full sun and very well-draining soil. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. This plant is low-maintenance, preferring poor soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Thrives in poor, infertile, well-draining soils characteristic of its native habitat and does not require regular fertilization.
