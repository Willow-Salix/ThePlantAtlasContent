| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (including Southern Canada, Western United States, and Northern Mexico) |

| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed desert and steppe environments. |
| **Watering** | Very low; allow soil to dry completely between infrequent, deep waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant, reflecting its adaptation to arid climates with sporadic rainfall. |

## Introduction
Krascheninnikovia is a genus of flowering plants in the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae known as winterfat, so-called because it is a nutritious livestock forage. They are known from Eurasia and western North America. These are hairy perennials or small shrubs which may be monoecious or dioecious. They bear spike inflorescences of woolly flowers.

## Care Guide
Winterfat requires care that mimics its native arid scrubland environment, thriving in full sun and very well-draining soil. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. This plant is low-maintenance, preferring poor soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Thrives in poor, infertile, well-draining soils characteristic of its native habitat and does not require regular fertilization.
