## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and semi-arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., Europe, North America, North Africa) and also found in parts of Australia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Semi-Arid, typically found in open, exposed habitats such as grasslands, heathlands, or sparse woodlands, often on calcareous soil or over mosses. |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure. Prefers full sun to partial sun, as it thrives in open environments with direct light. |
| **Watering** | Low. Relies on atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, humidity). Tolerant of dry periods and does not require frequent direct watering, especially if ambient humidity is moderate to high. |

## Introduction
Diploschistes is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Graphidaceae. Commonly known as crater lichens, members of the genus are crustose lichens with a thick, cracked (areolate) body (thallus) with worldwide distribution. The fruiting part (apothecia) are immersed in the thick thallus so as to have the appearance of being small "craters". The widespread genus contains about 43 species.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in open, sunny conditions, preferring well-ventilated spaces. It requires atmospheric moisture from rain or humidity but tolerates periods of dryness. No fertilization is needed, as it obtains nutrients naturally from its environment.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens are self-sufficient, deriving all necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate (soil, mosses). Artificial fertilization can be detrimental.
