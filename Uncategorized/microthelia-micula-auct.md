# Microthelia micula auct.
### *Microthelia micula auct.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widely distributed in diverse temperate to subtropical forested regions globally, primarily as an epiphytic (bark-dwelling) organism. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate and Subtropical Forests, requiring consistent atmospheric moisture. |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect light to partial shade, typically found under a forest canopy or in sheltered locations. Direct, harsh sunlight can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and frequent access to moisture from rain, dew, or mist. Does not absorb water through roots (as it lacks them) but directly from the environment. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in environments with high humidity and indirect light, typically growing on tree bark. It absorbs all required moisture and nutrients directly from the air and its substrate, rendering traditional watering or fertilizing not only unnecessary but potentially detrimental. Maintaining stable ambient moisture is critical for its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens acquire all necessary nutrients directly from the air, dust, and the substrate they grow on. Conventional fertilizers are unnecessary and can be harmful.
