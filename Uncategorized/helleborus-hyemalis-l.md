## 🧤 Care Instructions
Winter Aconites (Helleborus hyemalis L. is often considered a synonym for Eranthis hyemalis) flourish in temperate woodland settings, requiring sun in late winter/early spring before tree canopies emerge, then shade during summer dormancy. They need consistently moist, well-drained soil when active, with drier conditions acceptable when dormant. Enriching the soil with organic matter annually supports healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, organic soil. Apply a top-dressing of compost or leaf mold in fall or early spring. Appreciates soils with adequate calcium.
