## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western and Central North America, particularly the Great Plains of the United States (e.g., Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland and open woodlands. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, consistent with open prairie habitats). |
| **Watering** | Moderate, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings; it is accustomed to periods of drought once established, typical of grassland ecosystems. |

## Introduction

Commonly known as peavines or vetchlings, they are native to temperate areas, with a breakdown of 52 species in Europe, 30 species in North America, 78 in Asia, 24 in tropical East Africa, and 24 in temperate South America.

## Care Guide
Manystem Pea thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native North American prairies and open woodlands. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it naturally enriches the soil and does not require high nitrogen fertilization. A balanced fertilizer or one higher in phosphorus and potassium can be applied sparingly if growth is poor.
