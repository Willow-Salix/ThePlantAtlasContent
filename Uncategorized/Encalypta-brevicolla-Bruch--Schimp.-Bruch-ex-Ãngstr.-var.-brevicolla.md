## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal and Circumpolar regions, including mountainous areas of North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Zones |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to bright, indirect light. While it can be found in exposed sites in its native cold climate, protect from intense, prolonged direct sun to prevent drying, especially in warmer settings. |
| **Watering** | Moderate, allowing the substrate to dry slightly between waterings. Prefers consistent moisture but is tolerant of periodic dryness. Good drainage is essential. |

## Introduction
Encalypta is a genus of moss in the family Encalyptaceae; commonly known as "Extinguisher moss". It includes 34 species and is broadly distributed across the continents of America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, as well as Madagascar and New Zealand. The name is derived from the Greek en, meaning in, and kalyptos, which means to cover, veil or lid.

## Care Guide
This hardy moss thrives in cool temperatures and bright, indirect light, mimicking its alpine origins. It prefers moderate, consistent moisture, tolerating brief dry periods, and requires excellent drainage. Avoid overwatering and direct, scorching sun; fertilization is generally unnecessary for its growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses typically derive sufficient nutrients from their environment (water, air, substrate minerals) without direct fertilization.
