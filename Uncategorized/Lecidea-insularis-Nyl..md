## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America, typically on siliceous rocks. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate to Boreal |
| **Sunlight** | Tolerant of high sun exposure on exposed rock surfaces, but can also be found in partially shaded locations. Requires bright light for photosynthesis by its algal component. |
| **Watering** | Absorbs moisture directly from rain, dew, and atmospheric humidity. Requires frequent wetting and drying cycles; not tolerant of continuously saturated conditions, nor prolonged desiccation. Thrives in environments with regular atmospheric moisture or rainfall. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
Lecidea insularis is a saxicolous lichen found on exposed siliceous rocks in temperate to boreal regions. It thrives with bright, direct light and regular atmospheric moisture through rain and humidity, experiencing natural wetting and drying cycles. It does not require traditional soil or fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Obtains nutrients primarily from airborne dust, rainwater, and the substrate itself (siliceous rock). Does not require external fertilization as it does not grow in soil.
