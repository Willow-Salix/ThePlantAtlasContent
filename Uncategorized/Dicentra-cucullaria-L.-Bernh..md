## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (primarily United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade, particularly benefiting from early spring sun before tree canopies fully emerge, then moving to dappled or deep shade. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil during active growth in early spring. Allow soil to dry out considerably and reduce watering once the plant goes dormant in late spring or early summer. |

## Introduction
Dicentra (Greek dís "twice", kéntron "spur"), known collectively as the bleeding-hearts, is a genus containing eight species of herbaceous flowering perennial plants with unique, "heart"-shaped flowers and finely divided foliage. The species are, primarily, native to North America, although several are found in temperate East Asia.

## Care Guide
This ephemeral woodland plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded conditions typical of a temperate forest floor. Provide consistent moisture during its brief spring growth period, then allow it to dry out as it enters summer dormancy. Rich, organic soil and protection from harsh afternoon sun are key to its success.

### Fertilizer
Prefers rich, well-draining soil high in organic matter. A light application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is beneficial.
