## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including Alaska, British Columbia, Alberta, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and California. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine Wetlands / Montane Boreal, characterized by moist meadows, streambanks, and fens at high elevations. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it grows in open, moist areas, often exposed to high light levels. |
| **💧 Water** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native habitat along streambanks and in wet meadows; it is not drought-tolerant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This willow thrives in consistently wet conditions and full sun, replicating its native subalpine streambank and wet meadow habitats. Ensure high moisture levels and adequate light exposure for optimal health and growth, with minimal need for supplemental fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in naturally fertile, moist soils. Supplemental feeding is generally not critical if soil conditions are adequate, but a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can support vigorous growth in poor soils.
