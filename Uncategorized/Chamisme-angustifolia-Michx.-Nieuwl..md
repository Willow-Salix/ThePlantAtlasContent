## Care Guide
Fireweed is a resilient plant thriving in temperate to subarctic climates, preferring full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering, especially when establishing, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization. This adaptable species is ideal for open, disturbed areas.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer. Can thrive in average soils but benefits from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once in spring if soil is poor.
