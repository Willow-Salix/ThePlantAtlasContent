## Care Guide
This plant thrives in consistently moist to wet, acidic soil under full to partial sun, typical of its native boggy pineland habitats in the southeastern U.S. Provide ample water and avoid drought conditions, with minimal need for fertilizer due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Fertilize sparingly with an acid-loving formula if desired.
