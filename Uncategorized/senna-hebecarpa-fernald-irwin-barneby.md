## 🧤 Care Instructions
American Senna thrives in full sun with consistently moist, well-draining soil, although it shows good drought tolerance once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it requires minimal fertilization. This hardy plant is relatively low-maintenance, adapting well to various garden conditions.
