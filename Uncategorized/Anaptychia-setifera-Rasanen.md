## Introduction
Anaptychia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. Anaptychia species are foliose (leafy) to fruticose (bushy) lichens. They have brown, thin-walled spores with a single septum, and a prosoplechtenchymatous upper cortex.

## Care Guide
Fringed Lichen thrives in humid, temperate forest conditions with partial to bright indirect light. It relies on atmospheric moisture and its substrate for nutrients, requiring no conventional watering or fertilization beyond maintaining high humidity and occasional misting.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from the air and their growing substrate.
