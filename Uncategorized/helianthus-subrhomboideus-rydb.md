| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central United States and Canada (Great Plains region) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open prairie habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. Tolerates some drought once established, reflecting its native climate's rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Helianthus () is a genus comprising around 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the daisy family Asteraceae commonly known as sunflowers. Except for three South American species, the species of Helianthus are native to North America and Central America. The best-known species is the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus). This and other species, notably Jerusalem artichoke (H. tuberosus), are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions, as food crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants. The species H. annuus typically grows during the summer and into early fall, with the peak growth season being mid-summer.
Several perennial Helianthus species are grown in gardens, but have a tendency to spread rapidly and can become aggressive.  On the other hand, the whorled sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus, was listed as an endangered species in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule protecting it under the Endangered Species Act. The primary threats to this species are industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. They grow to 1.8 metres (6 feet) and are primarily found in woodlands, adjacent to creeks and moist, prairie-like areas.
The common sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine, cultivated there for several centuries.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This sunflower thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its native prairie habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and provide a balanced fertilizer if soil fertility is low. It is relatively low-maintenance and can tolerate some drought conditions once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Prefers well-draining, fertile soil. Can benefit from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season, but generally not a heavy feeder.
