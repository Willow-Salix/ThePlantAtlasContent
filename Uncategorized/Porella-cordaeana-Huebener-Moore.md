## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and parts of Asia |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade; intolerant of direct sunlight, which can scorch its delicate tissues. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist substrate and very high ambient humidity, mimicking its natural habitat near streams or in damp forests. Regular misting or placement in a terrarium/paludarium is essential. |

## Introduction
Porella is a large, common, and widespread genus of liverworts in order Porellales. It is a member of the family Porellaceae within that order. 
There were 84 species recognized in 2016, most of them from East Asia. World Flora Online accepts 125 species, and GBIF accepts 150 species (as of 4 July 2023).
The genus has a wide cosmopolitan distribution in temperate areas, where it is commonly found growing attached to the bark of trees. Members of the genus have lobed leaves with a large upper lobe and small lower lobe.
Species Porella arboris-vitae, Porella bolanderi, Porella cordeana, Porella navicularis, Porella pinnata, Porella platyphylla and Porella roellii, were all found in Montana, USA.

## Care Guide
Porella cordaeana thrives in cool, highly humid environments with low to partial light, emulating its native forest floor habitat. Consistent moisture and high humidity are crucial, while direct sun and excessive fertilization should be strictly avoided to prevent damage.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient requirements. Fertilizing is rarely necessary; if applied, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly.
