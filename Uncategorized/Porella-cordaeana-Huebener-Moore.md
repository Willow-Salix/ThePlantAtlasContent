## 🧤 Care Instructions
Porella cordaeana thrives in cool, highly humid environments with low to partial light, emulating its native forest floor habitat. Consistent moisture and high humidity are crucial, while direct sun and excessive fertilization should be strictly avoided to prevent damage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient requirements. Fertilizing is rarely necessary; if applied, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly.
