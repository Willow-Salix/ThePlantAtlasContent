## Care Guide
Hairy Goldenweed thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean to moderately fertile soils, reflecting its adaptation to open grassland and montane environments. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing infrequent watering and minimal fertilization for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; this plant is adapted to lean to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental.
