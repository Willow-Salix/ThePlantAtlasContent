## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South Africa (Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Northern Cape) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland and Semi-Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) reflecting its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water sparingly and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly during dormant periods (e.g., dry summers). |

## Introduction
Melolobium is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It includes 14 species of small shrubs or perennial herbs native to southern Africa, which are found in southern and eastern Namibia, southwestern Botswana, and most of South Africa.
These plants are perennial herbs and small shrubs. Leaves are often sticky with exudate from small surface glands. Some have spine-tipped branches. The leaves have three leaflets. The inflorescence is a terminal raceme of flowers. The flowers are yellow, sometimes fading orange or purple.

## Care Guide
This resilient shrub thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean and semi-arid origins. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum, particularly avoiding high-nitrogen formulas due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen; avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers which can inhibit this process. A balanced, low-dose fertilizer can be used sparingly if growth seems stunted.
