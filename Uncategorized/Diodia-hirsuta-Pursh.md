## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in warm, humid conditions with significant sun exposure, this plant requires consistent soil moisture but excellent drainage. It is not a heavy feeder and adapts well to average soil fertility, reflecting its resilience in its native disturbed habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder. Benefits from occasional light fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season, but can thrive in average soils without much supplemental feeding.
