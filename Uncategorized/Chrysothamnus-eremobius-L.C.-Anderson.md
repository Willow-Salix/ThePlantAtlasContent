| **Native Origin** | Western United States (Great Basin region, including parts of Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure; thrives in direct, intense sunlight throughout the day. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, as it is susceptible to root rot. |

## Introduction
Chrysothamnus, known as rabbitbrush, rabbitbush, and chamisa, are a genus of shrubs in the family Asteraceae. The native distribution is in the arid western United States, Canada, and northern Mexico. It is known for its bright white or yellow flowers in late summer.
Chrysothamnus may grow up to a 120 cm (47 in) tall shrub or subshrub, usually with woody stem bases.  The leaves are alternate, sessile or with short petioles, with entire edges. The flowerheads are singular or in clusters. Each composite flower often has five to 6 (though sometimes upwards of 40) yellow disc florets and no ray florets.
Chrysothamnus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora linosyridella, Coleophora viscidiflorella (which have both been recorded on C. viscidiflorus) and Schinia walsinghami.

## Care Guide
Pintwater Rabbitbrush is a resilient plant best suited for arid conditions, demanding full sun and minimal water. It thrives in poor soils and generally requires no fertilization, making it an exceptionally low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and typically does not require regular fertilization once established.
