## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widely distributed across temperate coastal and oceanic regions including Western Europe (e.g., British Isles, Atlantic coast of France, Portugal, Spain), Macaronesia, parts of North America (Pacific Northwest), Australia, New Zealand, and Chile. |
| **Climate** | Temperate oceanic/maritime to Mediterranean climates, often on exposed rock surfaces or tree bark where its host lichens thrive. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, direct light to partial shade, mirroring the conditions preferred by its host lichens which often grow in exposed locations with good air circulation. |
| **Watering** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and regular exposure to natural rainfall or misting, allowing for periods of drying between moistening events, as it relies on its host's water absorption from the environment. |

## Introduction
Skyttea is a genus of lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) fungi in the family Cordieritidaceae.

## Care Guide
This lichenicolous fungus thrives by parasitizing specific host lichens, such as Ramalina species, which typically grow in bright, exposed coastal or maritime environments. Successful 'cultivation' would involve replicating these conditions for its host, providing abundant light, good air circulation, and consistent humidity from natural rainfall or misting, rather than traditional soil-based watering or fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilization; nutrients are absorbed from atmospheric deposition and rainwater by its host lichen, rather than from soil.
