# Desert Broomrape

*Orobanche cooperi (A. Gray) A. Heller* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico (Baja California) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as this parasitic plant thrives in environments where its desert host plants receive abundant direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry out between waterings, mirroring the needs of its drought-adapted host plants in arid climates. |

## Introduction
Desert broomrape can refer to several parasitic plants in the family Orobanchaceae, including:

Cistanche deserticola
Cistanche tubulosa
Orobanche cooperi
Orobanche ludoviciana

## Care Guide
Desert Broomrape is a holoparasitic plant, completely reliant on a host plant for all water and nutrients. Its 'care' is inherently tied to cultivating a suitable host plant (typically desert shrubs or annuals) in conditions mimicking its native arid environment: full sun exposure and infrequent, deep watering.

### Fertilizer
Obtains all nutrients directly from its host plant; therefore, the focus should be on ensuring the host plant receives appropriate fertilization for its needs.
