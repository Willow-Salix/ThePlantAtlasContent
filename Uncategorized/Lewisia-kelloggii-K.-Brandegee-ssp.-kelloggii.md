## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States, specifically mountainous regions of California and Oregon (e.g., Sierra Nevada, Cascade Range). |
| **Climate** | Subalpine to Alpine Tundra, characterized by rocky, well-drained slopes and open forest areas. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun, especially in cooler climates, but can tolerate partial shade in hotter areas. Requires bright light. |
| **Watering** | Water moderately during its active growth period in spring and early summer, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce significantly or cease watering during its summer dormancy, as it is highly susceptible to rot in wet conditions. Requires exceptionally sharp drainage. |

## Introduction
Lewisia is a plant genus, named for the American explorer Meriwether Lewis (1774-1809) who encountered the species in 1806. The native habitat of Lewisia species is rocky ground and cliffs in western North America. Native Americans ate the roots, which have also been used to treat sore throats.

## Care Guide
Kellogg's Lewisia is an alpine plant requiring full sun and exceptionally sharp drainage to prevent rot. Water moderately in spring/early summer during active growth, then reduce significantly as it enters summer dormancy. It thrives in lean soils and needs minimal to no fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in lean, rocky soils. If fertilized, use a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly in early spring, or incorporate a small amount of compost annually. Avoid rich soils.
