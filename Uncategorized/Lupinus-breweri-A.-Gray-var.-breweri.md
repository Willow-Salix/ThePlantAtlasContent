## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean.

## Care Guide
Brewer's Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its high-altitude Sierra Nevada origins. It requires moderate watering, preferring to dry out between waterings and tolerating drought once established, while needing little to no supplemental fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, as it's a nitrogen-fixing legume. Avoid nitrogen-rich fertilizers.
