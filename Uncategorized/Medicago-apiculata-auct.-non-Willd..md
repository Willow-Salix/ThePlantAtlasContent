## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, encompassing Southern Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, typically found in open grasslands, fields, and disturbed areas. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, consistent with its natural habitat in exposed, open environments. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate watering needs. It is drought-tolerant once established, relying on winter rainfall in its native habitat and requiring less water during dry summer periods. Adequate moisture is crucial during germination and early growth. |

## Introduction
Medicago is a genus of flowering plants, commonly known as medick or burclover, in the legume family (Fabaceae). It contains at least 87 species and is distributed mainly around the Mediterranean Basin, and extending across temperate Eurasia and sub-Saharan Africa. The best-known member of the genus is alfalfa (M. sativa), an important forage crop, and the genus name is based on the Latin name for that plant, medica, from Greek: μηδική (πόα) Median (grass). Most members of the genus are low, creeping herbs, resembling clover, but with burs (hence the common name). However, alfalfa grows to a height of 1 meter, and tree medick (M. arborea) is a shrub. Members of the genus are known to produce bioactive compounds such as medicarpin (a flavonoid) and medicagenic acid (a triterpenoid saponin). Chromosome numbers in Medicago range from 2n = 14 to 48.
The species Medicago truncatula is a model legume due to its relatively small stature, small genome (450–500 Mbp), short generation time (about 3 months), and ability to reproduce both by outcrossing and selfing.
Comprehensive descriptions of the genus are Lesinš and Lesinš 1979 and Small and Jomphe 1989. Major collections are SARDI (Australia), USDA-GRIN (United States), ICARDA (Syria), and INRA (France).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and tolerates dry conditions, consistent with its Mediterranean origins. It is a low-maintenance legume, requiring minimal supplemental water once established and possessing low nitrogen fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, this plant fixes its own nitrogen from the atmosphere, thriving in moderate to low fertility soils and generally not requiring heavy nitrogen fertilization.
