## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Boreal forests and subalpine to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains), Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Boreal and Subalpine/Alpine |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to indirect bright light; avoid direct, intense sun, especially in dry conditions. |
| **Watering** | Requires high humidity and consistent moisture. Regular misting or placement in a terrarium with good airflow can help maintain moisture. Avoid standing water. |

## Introduction
Sulcaria is a genus of three species of fruticose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. Sulcaria was circumscribed by lichenologist Jan Bystrek in 1971. These lichens form hair-like or rope-like structures that hang from or grow upright on tree bark, with branches that develop distinctive lengthwise grooves as they age. They reproduce through disc-shaped fruiting bodies that contain large, dark brown spores with two unequal cells.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light, mimicking its native boreal and subalpine habitats. Maintain high ambient moisture through misting and avoid any form of direct fertilization, as it absorbs nutrients from the air.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed. Lichens are sensitive to external nutrients and pollutants.
