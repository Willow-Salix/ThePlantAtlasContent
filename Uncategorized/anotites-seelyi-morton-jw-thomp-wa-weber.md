## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in the cool, humid conditions found in North American montane coniferous forests. It requires high ambient humidity and consistent moisture, typically obtained from mist or rain, and must be protected from direct, intense sunlight. Avoid nutrient-rich substrates and any form of conventional fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; lichens obtain minimal nutrients from the atmosphere and are sensitive to nutrient pollution.
