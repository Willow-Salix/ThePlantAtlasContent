## Care Guide
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in well-drained soil and prefers bright light, tolerating some direct sun. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications, as it is adapted to dry conditions. Fertilize lightly during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization (e.g., half-strength balanced liquid fertilizer) once a month during the growing season. Prefers lean, well-draining soils.
