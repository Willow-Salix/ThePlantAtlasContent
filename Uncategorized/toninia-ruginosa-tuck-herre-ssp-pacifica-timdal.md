## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | West Coast of North America (California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Mediterranean, characterized by exposed, dry-mesic conditions on rocks or soil |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure, ideally full sun to partial sun, mimicking its native exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering, allowing significant dry periods between hydration, as it tolerates dry-mesic conditions and absorbs moisture from humidity and precipitation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Toninia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. The genus contains about 70 recognised species that are distributed worldwide, with many found in arctic and alpine environments as well as arid regions. These lichens are characterised by their often reduced or scale-like thalli and distinctive black apothecia (fruiting bodies) that typically become convex with age and contain needle-shaped ascospores. Toninia species primarily grow on soil, rocks, and other mineral substrates, and are distinguished from related genera by their spore-producing structures and chemical reactions to standard lichen identification tests.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen requires bright, exposed conditions and prefers a dry-mesic environment, necessitating infrequent watering with ample dry spells. As a low-nutrient organism, no specific fertilization is needed, as it naturally extracts sustenance from its surroundings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; lichens thrive in nutrient-poor environments, absorbing what they need from air and substrate.
