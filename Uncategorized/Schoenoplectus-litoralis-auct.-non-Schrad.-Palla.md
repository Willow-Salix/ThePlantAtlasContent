## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, Australia, and parts of Europe (Mediterranean to Eastern Europe). |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Wetlands, Marshes, and Riparian Zones |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun (thrives in bright, open light conditions typical of wetlands) |
| **Watering** | Constant saturation; keep soil consistently wet, moist, or partially submerged in water, never allowing it to dry out. |

## Introduction
Schoenoplectus (club-rush [Old World species], bulrush or tule [New World species]) is a genus of plants in the sedge family with a cosmopolitan distribution. Note that the name bulrush is also applied to species in the unrelated genus Typha as well as to other sedges. The genus Schoenoplectus was formerly considered part of Scirpus, but recent phylogenetic data shows that they are not closely related.

## Care Guide
This wetland plant thrives in consistently saturated to submerged conditions, requiring abundant water mimicking its native marsh habitats. It prefers full sun to partial sun exposure and benefits from moderate fertilization to support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced aquatic or slow-release fertilizer during its active growing season, consistent with nutrient availability in wetland environments.
