## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Florida (USA), Caribbean Islands (including Cuba, Bahamas, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico), Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest, Subtropical Dry Forest, and Scrubland. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial sun. In its native habitat, it typically grows in open areas or under light canopies, receiving abundant direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Tolerant of drought conditions due to its adaptation to dry forest environments with distinct wet and dry seasons. Water thoroughly when the topsoil is dry, allowing it to dry out significantly between waterings. Avoid overwatering and ensure excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Exostema is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of trees and shrubs, endemic to the neotropics, with most of the species occurring in the West Indies.

## Care Guide
Exostema thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical and subtropical dry forests. It requires abundant sunlight and well-draining soil, with a watering regimen that allows for dry periods between applications. Fertilizer needs are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to less nutrient-rich environments.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to low fertilizer needs. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season, typically once or twice a year. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
