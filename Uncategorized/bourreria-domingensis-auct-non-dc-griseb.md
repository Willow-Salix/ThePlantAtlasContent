The generic name was chosen by Patrick Browne to honour German pharmacist Johann Ambrosius Beurer. The genus is native to the tropical Americas and to eastern Africa and Madagascar. American species are distributed from Mexico to northern South America, and in the Caribbean and Florida in the United States. The center of diversity is in the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico. The eastern African species range from Ethiopia to Mozambique and to Madagascar, the Comoro Islands, and Mauritius.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable Caribbean plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry between sessions. It is drought-tolerant once established and benefits from light fertilization during active growth, making it a relatively low-maintenance option for tropical and subtropical gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding during the active growing season with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer. Less frequent fertilization is needed for established plants in rich soil.
