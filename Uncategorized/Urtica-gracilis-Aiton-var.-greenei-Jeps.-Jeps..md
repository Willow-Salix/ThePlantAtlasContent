## Introduction
Urtica is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. Many species have stinging hairs and may be called nettles or stinging nettles (the latter name applying particularly to U. dioica). The generic name Urtica derives from the Latin for 'sting'.
Due to the stinging hairs, Urtica are rarely eaten by herbivores, but provide shelter for insects. The fiber has historically been used by humans, and cooking preparations exist.

## Care Guide
This variety of stinging nettle thrives in consistently moist soil and prefers partial shade, though it can tolerate full sun with ample water. It adapts well to moderate to rich, well-draining soil, reflecting its native habitat in temperate riparian and woodland areas.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to rich, well-draining soil. Benefits from organic matter but does not require heavy fertilization.
