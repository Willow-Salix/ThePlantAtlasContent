| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (woodlands, open woods, glades, stream banks) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, appreciating some afternoon shade in hotter climates or during intense summer heat. In open woodland habitats, it receives dappled to direct morning sun. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist but well-draining soil, reflecting the frequent rainfall of its native humid subtropical environment. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Phlox (; Ancient Greek: φλόξ "flame"; plural "phlox" or "phloxes", Ancient Greek: φλόγες phlóges) is a genus of 68 species of perennial and annual plants in the family Polemoniaceae. They are found mostly in North America (one in Siberia) in diverse habitats from alpine tundra to open woodland and prairie. Some flower in spring, others in summer and fall.

## Care Guide
Carolina Phlox thrives in conditions mimicking its native Southeastern U.S. humid subtropical environment. It requires full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide regular watering and a light annual feeding to support its vigorous growth and prolific flowering.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, as native woodland soils are often moderately fertile from decomposing organic matter.
