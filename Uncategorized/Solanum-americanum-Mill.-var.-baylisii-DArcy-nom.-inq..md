## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | The Americas (North, Central, and South), often found globally as a naturalized species. |
| **Climate** | Warm Temperate to Subtropical zones, thriving in disturbed habitats, forest margins, and open fields. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. This adaptable plant can tolerate a range of light conditions, but often performs best with ample sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Regular and consistent moisture is preferred, though it can tolerate short periods of dryness. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Solanum is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants, which include three food crops of high economic importance: the potato, the tomato and the eggplant (aubergine, brinjal). It is the largest genus in the nightshade family Solanaceae, comprising around 1,500 species. It also contains the so-called horse nettles (unrelated to the genus of true nettles, Urtica), as well as numerous plants cultivated for their ornamental flowers and fruit.
Solanum species show a wide range of growth habits, such as annuals and perennials, vines, subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees. Many formerly independent genera like Lycopersicon (the tomatoes) and Cyphomandra are now included in Solanum as subgenera or sections. Thus, the genus today contains roughly 1,500–2,000 species.

## Care Guide
This adaptable nightshade thrives in warm temperate to subtropical climates, tolerating both full sun and partial shade. It prefers consistent moisture but is relatively resilient to varied conditions, requiring only low to moderate fertilization. Its general hardiness makes it a low-maintenance plant in appropriate environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a resilient species, it does not typically require heavy fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied sparingly (e.g., once every 4-6 weeks during active growth) should suffice if needed.
