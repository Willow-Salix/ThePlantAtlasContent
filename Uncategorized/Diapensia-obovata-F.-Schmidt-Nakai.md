| **Native Origin** | Northeastern Asia, including the Kamchatka Peninsula, Sakhalin, and Kuril Islands (Russia), Hokkaido and Honshu (Japan), and Korea. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; requires high light exposure characteristic of treeless alpine environments. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but very well-drained soil; mimics conditions of melting snow and frequent rainfall on rocky substrates, intolerant of waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in cool, exposed conditions with full sun and excellent drainage. It requires consistently moist soil, especially during its short growing season, but is highly sensitive to waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal or avoided, mimicking its native lean, rocky habitat.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none; native alpine soils are typically lean and nutrient-poor, preferring a gritty, unfertilized substrate.
