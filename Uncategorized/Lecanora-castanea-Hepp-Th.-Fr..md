## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic regions (e.g., Greenland, Svalbard), European Alps, Rocky Mountains in North America. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High intensity, full sun exposure, mimicking the open and often exposed conditions of alpine and arctic environments. |
| **Watering** | Primarily derives moisture from atmospheric humidity, dew, and occasional rain/snowmelt. Requires consistent high humidity or frequent misting; its substrate should be kept moist but not waterlogged, allowing for periods of dryness. |

## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine lichen thrives in cold, high-light environments with excellent air circulation. Mimic its native conditions by providing nutrient-poor, siliceous rock, high atmospheric humidity or frequent misting, and allowing for periods of desiccation. Avoid traditional fertilizers, as they are harmful to this species.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers and is highly sensitive to nutrient excess. Thrives in nutrient-poor conditions, deriving minimal nutrients from atmospheric dust and rain.
