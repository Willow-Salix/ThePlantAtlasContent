| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Rocky Slopes |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, high-altitude habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering; highly drought-tolerant once established. Requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, making it ideal for xeriscape or rock gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required; thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils typical of its native environment.
