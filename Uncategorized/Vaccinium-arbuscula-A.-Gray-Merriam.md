## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains including British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine to Alpine Temperate Forest/Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers good light exposure for best growth and fruit production, especially morning sun with some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil. Mimics regular precipitation and snowmelt from its native habitat. Avoid waterlogging and do not allow the soil to dry out completely during the growing season. |

## Introduction
Vaccinium  vack-SIN-ee-əm is a common and widespread genus of shrubs or dwarf shrubs in the heath family (Ericaceae). The fruits of many species are eaten by humans and some are of commercial importance, including the cranberry, blueberry, bilberry (whortleberry), lingonberry (cowberry), and huckleberry. Like many other heath plants, they are restricted to acidic soils.

## Care Guide
The Little Huckleberry thrives in cool, subalpine conditions with full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, highly acidic, well-drained soil. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, and use an acid-specific fertilizer sparingly to mimic its native low-nutrient, acidic environment. Good drainage is crucial to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization with an acid-specific formula (pH 4.5-5.5) suitable for Ericaceous plants. Native soils are often low in nutrients, so heavy fertilization is not required. Organic matter can help maintain acidity and soil health.
