## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Hemisphere, including Europe (e.g., British Isles, Scandinavia, Central Europe) and North America (e.g., Great Lakes region, northeastern US, Canada). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Freshwater Aquatic (Oligotrophic Lakes) |
| **Sunlight** | Requires moderate to bright indirect light, replicating the filtered conditions of shallow, clear lake waters. Intense direct sunlight should be avoided to prevent overheating and excessive algal growth. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant submersion in clean, fresh, cool, and well-oxygenated water. The water parameters should be stable with minimal fluctuations. |

## Introduction
Isoetes lacustris, the lake quillwort or Merlin's grass, is a boreal quillwort native on both sides of the northern Atlantic Ocean. In Europe, it is distributed from Poland west to northeastern France, throughout Scandinavia, the west and north of the British Isles, the Faroe Islands and Iceland. Further south, isolated populations occur in the glacial lakes of the Pirin mountain range in Bulgaria.

## Care Guide
Lake Quillwort is a fully aquatic plant thriving in consistently submerged, clear, cool, and nutrient-poor fresh water. It requires moderate to bright indirect light to simulate its native lake environment, and fertilization should be kept minimal due to its adaptation to oligotrophic conditions.

### Fertilizer
Prefers nutrient-poor conditions, characteristic of oligotrophic lakes. Fertilization should be minimal to none. If grown in an aquarium, use specialized aquatic substrate or very dilute liquid fertilizer cautiously to avoid nutrient overload.
