## Introduction
Zephyranthes candida, with common names that include autumn zephyrlily, white windflower, white rain lily, and Peruvian swamp lily, is a species of rain lily native to South America including Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil.

## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun and well-drained, consistently moist soil, the White Rain Lily requires regular watering, especially during its active growth period. Mimicking its grassland origins, it benefits from moderate fertilization to encourage robust flowering after periods of rain.

### Fertilizer
Moderate needs; a balanced slow-release granular fertilizer or a liquid feed diluted to half strength applied monthly during the growing season.
