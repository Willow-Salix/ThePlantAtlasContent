# Mastigolejeunea auriculata
### *Mastigolejeunea auriculata (Wilson & Hook.) Schiffn.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across tropical and subtropical Asia, Oceania (including Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand), and parts of Africa (e.g., Madagascar, Reunion). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest / Subtropical Moist Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to very indirect light. Thrives in deeply shaded or dappled light conditions, protected from direct sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high humidity and a continuously moist (but not waterlogged) substrate. Frequent misting is beneficial, and good air circulation is key to prevent rot while maintaining humidity. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort demands high humidity and consistently moist, non-soggy conditions, mimicking its native rainforest habitat. Provide very low to indirect light, avoiding any direct sun, and fertilize extremely sparingly or not at all to prevent nutrient burn.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. If used, apply an extremely diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/8th strength of an orchid fertilizer) very infrequently, perhaps once a month during active growth.
