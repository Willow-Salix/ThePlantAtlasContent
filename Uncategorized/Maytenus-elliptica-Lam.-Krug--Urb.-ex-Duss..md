## Introduction
Maytenus  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Celastraceae. Members of the genus are distributed throughout Central and South America, Southeast Asia, Micronesia, and Australasia, the Indian Ocean and Africa. They grow in a very wide variety of climates, from tropical to subpolar. The traditional circumscription of Maytenus was paraphyletic, so many species have been transferred to Denhamia and Gymnosporia.

## Care Guide
Maytenus elliptica thrives in bright, sunny conditions reminiscent of its Caribbean dry forest origins. It requires well-draining soil and moderate watering, tolerating dry periods between watering sessions. Fertilize lightly during its active growth phase for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly during the active growing season, reducing or withholding during dormancy.
