## Introduction
Melilotus, known as melilot or sweet clover is a genus of legumes in the family Fabaceae, native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. The genus is closely related to Trifolium (clovers). Several species are common grassland plants and weeds of cultivated ground, and some species are now found worldwide as naturalised plants.
The scientific and English names both derive from Greek melílōtos from méli (honey), and lōtos (lotus), via Latin melilōtos and Old French mélilot. The alternative name "sweet clover" varies in orthography, also cited as sweet-clover and sweetclover. Other names include "kumoniga", from the Cumans.

## Care Guide
White Sweetclover is an adaptable plant best suited for full sun exposure and well-draining soil. It requires moderate watering, becoming quite drought-tolerant once established, and has minimal to no fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, White Sweetclover enriches the soil and thrives in poor to average soil conditions without additional fertilization.
