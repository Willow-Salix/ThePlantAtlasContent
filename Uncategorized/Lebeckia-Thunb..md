## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Africa, primarily the Cape Provinces of South Africa and Namibia. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean and Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland (e.g., Fynbos, Renosterveld, Succulent Karoo). |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. It thrives in open, exposed environments characteristic of its native scrubland and semi-desert habitats, requiring direct sunlight for optimal growth. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. It is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, especially once established. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its native dry seasons and preventing root rot. |

## Introduction
Lebeckia is a genus of plants in the family Fabaceae native to the fynbos (Cape Floristic Kingdom) of South Africa. Several members of Lebeckia were recently transferred to other genera (Calobota and Wiborgiella). Members of Lebeckia are known to produce  pyrrolizidine alkaloids, including ammodendrine, lebeckianine, and lupanine. The genus was named by Carl Thunberg for his student Heinrich Julius Lebeck.

## Care Guide
Lebeckia thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its origins in the arid and Mediterranean climates of Southern Africa. It requires infrequent watering due to its drought tolerance and benefits from very minimal fertilization in nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. Native to nutrient-poor, often sandy or rocky soils, Lebeckia has minimal nutrient needs. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, using a low-phosphorus formula, as excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
