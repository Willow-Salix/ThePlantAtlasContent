## Care Guide
Mexican Senna thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native subtropical dry forest and savanna habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering once established, and generally needs minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring is generally sufficient, especially in well-draining, moderately fertile soil, as Fabaceae often fix nitrogen.
