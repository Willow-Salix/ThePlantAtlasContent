## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Lesser Antilles (Caribbean), including islands like Martinique and Guadeloupe |
| **Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. In its native habitat, it grows under the canopy, so direct harsh sun should be avoided to prevent leaf scorch. |
| **Watering** | Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, reflecting the high rainfall and humidity of its tropical forest origin. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent bulb rot. |

## Introduction
Hymenocallis  (US) or  (UK) is a genus of flowering plants in the amaryllis family native to the Americas.
Hymenocallis contains more than 60 species of herbaceous bulbous perennials native to the southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. Some species are cultivated as ornamentals in warm nations around the globe, and a few have become naturalized in parts of Africa and on various tropical islands. Many of the species from the Caribbean and from the southeastern United States inhabit wet areas such as marshes, streambanks, and seashores. Some species even have floating seeds. Some of the Mexican species, in contrast, grow on grassy slopes in hills and mountains.
The flower stalks arise from basal rosettes of strap-shaped leaves. The terminal clusters of fragrant flowers are green, white or yellow, and can be large and spectacular. The genus name is derived from the Greek words ὑμήν (hymen), meaning "membrane", and καλός (kalos), meaning "beautiful".  It refers to the curious shape of the flowers, which consist of six narrow, curved petals attached to a shallow cup that is formed from the fused stamens. The effect is of a spidery daffodil or lily, thus explaining the common name "spider lily".

## Care Guide
The Green-Tinge Spiderlily thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical moist forest. Provide bright indirect light, consistent moisture, and regular feeding during its growing period. Ensure well-draining soil and high humidity for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Fertilize regularly during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, as tropical forest soils are generally rich from constant organic decomposition.
