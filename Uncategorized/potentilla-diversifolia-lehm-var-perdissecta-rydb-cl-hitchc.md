## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, particularly subalpine and alpine regions of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest (USA and Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun is preferred, mimicking its open meadow habitat; can tolerate some partial sun, especially in hot afternoon conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate, consistent moisture, especially during dry periods. Its native areas receive ample moisture from snowmelt and summer rains, but also feature good drainage. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mountainmeadow Cinquefoil thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean to moderately fertile soil, reflecting its native subalpine meadow environment. Provide moderate, consistent moisture, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly. This hardy plant is excellent for rock gardens or alpine landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers lean to moderately fertile soils; heavy fertilization is generally not needed. A light annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient.
