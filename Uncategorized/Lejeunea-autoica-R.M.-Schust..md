## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Wet Forests, Swamps, and Ravines) |
| **Sunlight** | Very low to indirect light; mimic a forest understory with dappled or filtered light. Avoid all direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture and very high humidity. Keep substrate constantly damp but not waterlogged. Frequent misting or cultivation in a closed terrarium is essential. |

## Introduction
Lejeunea is a genus of leafy liverworts in the Lejeuneaceae family. The GBIF lists up to 592 species (as of October 2022), along with a worldwide distribution. World Flora Online lists up to 531 species (as of July 2023).
The genus was circumscribed by Marie-Anne Libert in Ann. Gen. Sci. Phys. vol.6 on page 372 in 1820.
The genus name of Lejeunea is in honour of Alexandre Louis Simon Lejeune (1779–1858), who was a Belgian physician and botanist.

## Care Guide
Lejeunea autoica thrives in conditions replicating its humid subtropical forest understory habitat, demanding very high humidity and consistently moist, indirect light. Meticulous watering to maintain dampness without waterlogging, often within a terrarium setup, is critical, alongside minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low; bryophytes obtain most nutrients from air and water. If used, apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer sparingly once or twice a year, or none at all.
