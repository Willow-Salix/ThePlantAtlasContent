# False Hair Moss

*Pseudisothecium stoloniferum (Brid.) Grout var. cardotii (Kindb.) Grout* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Pacific Northwest (e.g., British Columbia, Washington, Oregon) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforest / Coastal Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium, indirect light; dappled or filtered sun similar to an understory forest environment. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged, mimicking frequent rainfall. High ambient humidity is crucial. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, moist conditions with consistent humidity and indirect light, replicating its native temperate rainforest habitat. Ensure the substrate or growing surface remains consistently damp, avoiding both drying out and waterlogging, and provide good air circulation.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none; mosses absorb nutrients directly from water and air. If fertilized, use a highly diluted liquid solution very infrequently.
