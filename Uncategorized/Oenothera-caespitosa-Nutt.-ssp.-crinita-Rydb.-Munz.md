## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Great Basin region and Southwestern United States (e.g., Nevada, Utah, Arizona, California) |
| **Climate** | Arid Shrubland / Cold Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering or soggy conditions will lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Oenothera cespitosa, known commonly as tufted evening-primrose or fragrant evening-primrose, is a perennial plant of the genus Oenothera native to western North America from the western edge of the Great Plains and all parts of the Intermountain West in a wide range of dry habitats. Its flowers are open at night and fade by the next day. The species is cultivated in gardens, particularly in its native range.

## Care Guide
To care for the Tufted Evening Primrose, provide full sun and mimic its native arid environment by ensuring excellent drainage and very infrequent deep watering. It requires lean soil and minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny locations.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in lean to poor, well-draining soil. Minimal or no fertilization is required; a very light, balanced feed once in spring is sufficient if the soil is extremely poor.
