## Care Guide
This wetland grass thrives in consistently wet conditions, tolerating full sun to partial shade. It requires ample water and benefits from the nutrient-rich environment typical of its native marshy habitats, making heavy fertilization generally unnecessary. Mimicking its wetland origin is key to its successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in the naturally rich organic matter of wetland soils. Supplemental fertilization is generally not heavily needed but a light annual application of a balanced fertilizer can support vigorous growth in poorer soils.
