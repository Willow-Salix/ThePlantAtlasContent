## Care Guide
Cherry Silverberry thrives in full sun to partial shade within temperate climates, requiring moderate watering to maintain consistently moist soil, especially when young. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it has very low fertilizer requirements, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; as a nitrogen-fixing plant, it enriches its own soil. Minimal fertilization is required, perhaps a light, balanced application in poor soils.
