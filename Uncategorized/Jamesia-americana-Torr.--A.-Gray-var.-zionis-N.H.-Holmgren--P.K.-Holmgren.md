## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (specifically Southern Utah and Northern Arizona canyonlands) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in high light exposure typical of exposed cliff faces and canyon environments. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; highly drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings, especially crucial in well-drained, rocky media. |

## Introduction
Jamesia is a genus of shrubs in the Hydrangeaceae, most commonly known as Jamesia, cliffbush or waxflower. It is native to interior western North America, in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming, growing in mountains at 1600–3000 m altitude.

## Care Guide
The Zion Cliffbush is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub perfectly suited for arid environments. It thrives in full sun and rocky, well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established due to its adaptation to infrequent rainfall. Avoid overwatering and excessive fertilization to ensure optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low; minimal fertilization is needed. Plants adapted to lean, rocky soils generally do not require rich nutrient input. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be used if growth is very poor.
