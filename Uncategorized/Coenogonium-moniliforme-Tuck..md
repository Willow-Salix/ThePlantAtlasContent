## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States, Central America, and the Caribbean |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Humid Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Very low, indirect light, mimicking the deep shade of a forest understory. Direct sunlight will be detrimental. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and frequent moisture absorption directly from the air. Regular misting or placement in an enclosed, humid terrarium environment is essential. |

## Introduction
Coenogonium is a genus of filamentous lichens in the monotypic family Coenogoniaceae. It has about 90 species. Most species are leaf-dwelling or grow on bark, although a few are known to grow on rocks under certain conditions, and some are restricted to growth on termite nests. The genus was circumscribed in 1820 by German naturalist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg.
Coenogonium has a worldwide distribution, with most species known from tropical areas. Most species grow in tropical rainforests in the shaded understorey. They typically grow on tree trunks, branches, lianas, and leaves.

## Care Guide
To care for Coenogonium Lichen, replicate its native subtropical humid forest understory by providing very low, indirect light and maintaining extremely high humidity with frequent moisture, ideally within a terrarium. Avoid direct sun and conventional fertilization, as the lichen absorbs nutrients from the air.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and rain; traditional soil-based fertilization is not applicable and can be harmful.
