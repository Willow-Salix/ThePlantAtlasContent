## Care Guide
This temperate orchid thrives in partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil during its active growing season. Provide bright, indirect light and a dilute, balanced fertilizer during spring and summer. Ensure a period of reduced watering and cooler temperatures during dormancy in winter.
