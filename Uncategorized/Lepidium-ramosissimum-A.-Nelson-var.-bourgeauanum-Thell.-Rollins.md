| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Prairie |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its open prairie habitat. |

## Introduction
Lepidium is a genus of plants in the mustard/cabbage family, Brassicaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. It includes familiar species such as garden cress, maca, and dittander. General common names include peppercress, peppergrass, pepperweed, and pepperwort.  Some species form tumbleweeds.
The genus name Lepidium is from Greek meaning 'small scale', which is thought to be derived from a folk medicine usage of the plant to treat leprosy, which cause small scales on the skin. Another meaning is related to the small scale-like fruit.

## Care Guide
Bourgeau's Pepperweed thrives in full sun exposure, mimicking its open prairie origins. It prefers moderate watering but is quite drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal fertilization. This hardy plant is generally low-maintenance, reflecting its adaptation to challenging grassland environments.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; it is a hardy, often weedy species accustomed to varied soil fertility, so excessive fertilization is unnecessary.
