## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widely distributed across temperate and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Arctic Drylands / Xeric Scrubland (often on calcareous soils) |
| **Sunlight** | High, prefers full sun exposure. Thrives in open, unshaded habitats. |
| **Watering** | Extremely low. Requires very infrequent watering, preferring dry, xeric conditions. Allow substrate to dry completely between any moisture events. |

## Introduction
Toninia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. The genus contains about 70 recognised species that are distributed worldwide, with many found in arctic and alpine environments as well as arid regions. These lichens are characterised by their often reduced or scale-like thalli and distinctive black apothecia (fruiting bodies) that typically become convex with age and contain needle-shaped ascospores. Toninia species primarily grow on soil, rocks, and other mineral substrates, and are distinguished from related genera by their spore-producing structures and chemical reactions to standard lichen identification tests.

## Care Guide
Toninia Squarrosa is a terrestrial lichen adapted to harsh, dry, and sunny environments. It thrives with abundant light and extremely limited moisture, preferring calcareous substrates. Avoid overwatering and fertilization, as these conditions are detrimental to its survival.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens do not require traditional fertilization; excess nutrients can be detrimental. Its substrate should ideally be calcareous.
