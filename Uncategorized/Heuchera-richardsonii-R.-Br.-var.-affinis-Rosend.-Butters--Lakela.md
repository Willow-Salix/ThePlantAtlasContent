## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central North America (prairies and open woodlands of the central United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Temperate Open Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial sun to full sun. In hotter climates, some afternoon shade is beneficial to prevent leaf scorch, mirroring its occurrence in open woodlands as well as prairies. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings, consistent with the seasonal rainfall patterns and occasional dry spells of its native prairies. Tolerant of some drought once established. |

## Introduction
Heuchera ( HEW-kih-rə or  HOY-kih-rə) is a genus of largely evergreen perennial plants in the family Saxifragaceae. All species are native to North America except for Heuchera sichotensis, native to the Russian Far East. Common names include alumroot and coral bells.

## Care Guide
Prairie Alumroot thrives in temperate grassland conditions, preferring partial to full sun and moderate, consistent watering. It benefits from well-draining soil with some organic matter and requires only light fertilization. Once established, it shows good drought tolerance.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. Native prairie soils can be rich in organic matter but not overly nutrient-dense. A light application of balanced fertilizer or annual amendment with compost in spring is sufficient.
