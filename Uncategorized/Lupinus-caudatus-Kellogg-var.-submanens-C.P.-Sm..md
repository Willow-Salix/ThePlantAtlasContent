## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Shrubland/Dry Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, thriving in open, unshaded environments typical of mountain slopes and scrublands. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering during active growth in spring and early summer. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot; reduce watering significantly during dormancy or dry periods. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
This lupine requires abundant sunlight and exceptionally well-drained soil to mimic its native montane habitat. Water moderately during its growing season, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in lean soils and does not require heavy fertilization, particularly with nitrogen, which can inhibit flowering.
