## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen thrives in environments with high atmospheric humidity and dappled light, typically growing on trees or rocks. It requires good air circulation and obtains all its water and nutrients directly from the air and rain, meaning no soil or traditional fertilizer is needed. Protection from air pollution and direct sun is crucial for its survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilization. It obtains all necessary nutrients directly from the air and precipitation, and is sensitive to pollutants.
