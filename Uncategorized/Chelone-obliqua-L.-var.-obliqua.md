## Care Guide
The Red Turtlehead thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native wetland habitats. It prefers partial shade, especially during the hot afternoon, though it can tolerate full sun if adequate moisture is maintained. Provide a moderately fertile soil, enriched with organic matter, to ensure vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from rich, organic soil. An annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer is generally sufficient.
