## Care Guide
Rocky Mountain Columbine flourishes in cool, moist, and well-drained environments, typical of its high-altitude native habitat. Provide full sun to partial shade, ensuring soil moisture is consistent without being waterlogged. A light application of fertilizer in spring promotes robust growth and prolific flowering.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization in early spring with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or compost. Over-fertilizing can lead to leggy growth.
