## Introduction
Kohlrabi (German: [koːlˈʁaːbi] ; pronounced  in English; scientific name Brassica oleracea Gongylodes Group), also called German turnip or turnip cabbage, is a biennial vegetable, a low, stout cultivar of wild cabbage. It is a cultivar of the same species as cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, Savoy cabbage, and gai lan.
It can be eaten raw or cooked. Edible preparations are made with both the stem and the leaves. Despite its common names, it is not the same species as turnip, although both are in the genus Brassica.

## Care Guide
Kohlrabi thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist, well-draining, fertile soil. Regular watering is crucial for developing tender, flavorful bulbs, and it benefits from nutrient-rich growing conditions to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to heavy feeder, benefits from rich, well-draining soil amended with organic matter. A balanced fertilizer can be applied during active growth.
