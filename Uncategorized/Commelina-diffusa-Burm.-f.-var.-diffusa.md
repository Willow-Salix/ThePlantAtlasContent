## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of the Old World (Asia, Africa, Australia) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet and Dry / Tropical Monsoon |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Shade to Full Sun. In its native environment, it often grows in open, disturbed areas or at the edges of forests, indicating a preference for bright light but also tolerance for some shade. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil. Water frequently to prevent the soil from drying out, especially during warm periods. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Commelina is a genus of approximately 208 species commonly called dayflowers due to the short lives of their flowers. They are less often known as widow's tears. It is by far the largest genus of its family, Commelinaceae. The Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus of the 18th century named the genus after the two Dutch botanists Jan Commelijn and his nephew Caspar, each representing one of the showy petals of Commelina communis.
The dayflowers are herbs that may be either perennial or annual. They are characterised by their zygomorphic flowers and by the involucral bracts called spathes that surround the flower stalks. These spathes are often filled with a mucilaginous liquid. Each spathe houses either one or two scorpioid cymes, with the upper cyme being either vestigial or bearing from one to several typically male flowers, and the lower cyme bearing several flowers. All members of the genus have alternate leaves.
The Asiatic dayflower (Commelina communis) is probably the best known species in the West. It is a common weed in parts of Europe and throughout eastern North America. Several species, such as Commelina benghalensis, are eaten as a leaf vegetable in Southeast Asia and Africa.

## Care Guide
An adaptable tropical plant, the Climbing Dayflower thrives with consistent moisture and bright, indirect to partial sunlight. It is not a demanding feeder but appreciates regular watering to keep its soil moist. Protect from extreme midday sun in very hot climates to prevent scorching.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. While adaptable to various soil types, it benefits from the organic matter found in its native tropical environments. A light, balanced fertilizer applied every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season is sufficient.
