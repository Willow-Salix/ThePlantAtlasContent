## 🌱 Overview
Stipa is a genus of about 140 species of large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and  spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to Stipa, which have since been reclassified into new genera.
Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as Stipa brachytricha, S. arundinacea, S. splendens, S. gigantea and S. pulchra are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.
It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Mediterranean feather grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, adapted to hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It requires infrequent watering once established, exhibiting significant drought tolerance, and generally prefers low to moderate soil fertility.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. These grasses are adapted to nutrient-poor soils and do not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced feed in early spring is sufficient if needed.
