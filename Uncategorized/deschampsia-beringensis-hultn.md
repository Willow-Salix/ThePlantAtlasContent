## 🌱 Overview
Deschampsia is a genus of plants in the grass family Poaceae, commonly known as hair grass or tussock grass. The genus is widespread across many countries.
The genus is named for French physician and naturalist Louis Auguste Deschamps (1765–1842).
Deschampsia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera, including antler moth, the clay, clouded-bordered brindle, common wainscot, dark arches, dusky brocade, shoulder-striped wainscot, smoky wainscot and wall.
Deschampsia sometimes grow in boggy acidic formations, an example of which is the Portlethen Moss, Scotland. 
Deschampsia antarctica is the world's most southern monocot, and one of only two flowering plants of Antarctica.
Some species, such as D. cespitosa, are grown as ornamental garden plants.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bering's Tufted Hairgrass thrives in full sun and consistently moist, even wet, soil conditions, reflective of its subarctic tundra origins. It is well-adapted to nutrient-poor soils and requires minimal fertilization. Ensure adequate moisture and open exposure for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; adapted to nutrient-poor soils common in tundra and alpine regions. Light feeding, if any, is sufficient.
