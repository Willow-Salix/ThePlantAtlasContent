## Introduction
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in arid, sunny conditions, requiring full sun exposure and infrequent, deep watering to simulate its native desert habitat. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, so avoid heavy fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer; adapted to nutrient-poor, calcareous soils.
