| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to mimic its open desert habitat. |

## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. It is highly drought-tolerant and prefers lean soil, thus needing minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. Native desert soils are typically lean, so rich soil or frequent feeding can be detrimental. If necessary, use a very dilute, low-phosphorus fertilizer sparingly.
