## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland / Arid Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to very low; drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially once established. Mimics native dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Isocoma, commonly called jimmyweed or goldenweed, is a genus of North American semi-woody shrubs in the family Asteraceae. It is found in the semi-arid areas of Southwestern United States and Mexico.
The name of this genus is derived from the Greek for "equal hair" referring to the pappus on the seed.
Isocoma species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia bicuspida (recorded on I. drummondii), Schinia erosa (feeds exclusively on I. acradenia) and Schinia tertia (recorded on I. pluriflora).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Menzies' Goldenbush is a highly drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native Mediterranean scrubland. Provide well-draining soil and minimal water once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between watering sessions. Avoid excessive fertilization to maintain its natural robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Native soils in arid scrublands are often lean; over-fertilization can harm the plant. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, if at all.
