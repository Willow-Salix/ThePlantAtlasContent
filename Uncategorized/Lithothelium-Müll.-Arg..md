## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pantropical regions, including Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and parts of Africa. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Rainforests |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light; thrives in dappled shade found beneath dense forest canopies, protected from direct sun. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity is crucial; occasional rainfall or consistent misting to keep the thallus moist, avoiding prolonged dry periods. Water absorption is primarily from air and rain. |

## Introduction
Lithothelium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Pyrenulaceae. Most of the species are found in tropical climates, and are usually  corticolous (bark-dwelling) or saxicolous (rock-dwelling). These lichens form thin, crust-like layers that are often embedded within their substrate and are characterized by distinctive black, flask-shaped reproductive structures that may occur individually or in fused clusters with small openings for spore release. Established as a genus in 1885 by the Swiss botanist Johannes Müller Argoviensis, Lithothelium species can be distinguished from similar lichens by their rounded spore compartments and the presence of specialized structures called ocular chambers that assist in spore discharge.

## Care Guide
Lithothelium lichens require a consistently humid environment with low to moderate indirect light, mimicking their native tropical forest habitat. Ensure regular moisture through misting or high ambient humidity, and avoid direct sun and traditional fertilizers, as they obtain nutrients atmospherically.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; lichens primarily absorb nutrients from air, rain, and the substrate (e.g., tree bark), not requiring traditional fertilization.
