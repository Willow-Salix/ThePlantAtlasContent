## Introduction
Collinsia is a genus of about 20 species of annual flowering plants, consisting of the blue eyed Marys and the Chinese houses.  It was traditionally placed in the snapdragon family Scrophulariaceae, but following recent research in molecular genetics, it has now been placed in a much enlarged family Plantaginaceae.
The genus is endemic to North America, and is named in honor of Zacchaeus Collins, a Philadelphia botanist of the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century. Many of the 20 species may be found in California.
Two species, Collinsia parviflora (smallflower blue eyed Mary) and Collinsia violacea (violet blue eyed Mary), had medicinal uses among American Indian peoples.

## Care Guide
This annual wildflower, native to Western North American temperate woodlands, thrives in partial shade to full sun, particularly benefiting from afternoon shade in warmer regions. It requires consistent moisture during its spring growing season but generally needs minimal fertilization, preferring well-draining soil.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically no fertilizer is needed in average soil, or a very light application of balanced fertilizer in spring.
