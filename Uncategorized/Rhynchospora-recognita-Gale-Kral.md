## 🌱 Overview
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Globe Beaksedge thrives in consistently wet to saturated soils, often with standing water, under full to partial sun. Mimicking its native bog and wetland habitats is crucial, requiring high humidity and preventing any soil dryness. Fertilize lightly, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from occasional light feeding, especially in nutrient-poor bog soils.
