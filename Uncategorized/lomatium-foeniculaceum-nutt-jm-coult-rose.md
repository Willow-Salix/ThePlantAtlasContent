## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western and Central North America, spanning the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and western states of the USA and Canada. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Temperate Grassland (Steppe) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct, unfiltered sunlight daily) is essential, reflecting its open, exposed native habitat on prairies and dry slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to completely dry out between waterings. Overwatering, especially during dormancy, is detrimental. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This highly drought-tolerant plant requires full sun and exceptionally well-drained soil to mimic its arid native habitat. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. Avoid over-fertilization, as it thrives in lean conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs. Fertilization is generally not necessary, as it thrives in lean, well-drained soils. If growth is poor, a very light, balanced application once a year may suffice.
