## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in prairies, open woodlands, and meadows) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect to partial sun. Can tolerate full sun in cooler climates or with adequate moisture, but prefers some afternoon shade in hotter regions. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. It prefers consistently moist but not waterlogged conditions, reflecting the humid subtropical rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Tradescantia buckleyi, commonly known as Buckley's spiderwort, is a species of flowering plant in the dayflower family, Commelinaceae. It is native to southern Texas in the United States as well as northern Tamaulipas in Mexico. The specific name honours Samuel Botsford Buckley (1809-1884), who collected the type specimen near Corpus Christi, Texas.

## Care Guide
Buckley's Spiderwort thrives in bright indirect to partial sun and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Water regularly, allowing slight drying between waterings, and provide moderate fertilizer during its growth period. This approach mimics its native humid subtropical prairie and woodland environment.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer). Native soils in its habitat are typically moderately fertile, benefiting from occasional nutrient replenishment.
