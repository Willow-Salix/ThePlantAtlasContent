# Nodding Willowherb
### *Epilobium alpinum L. var. nutans Hornem.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal region of the Northern Hemisphere, including alpine and subalpine areas of Europe, North America, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra to Subalpine Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial shade. It is accustomed to bright, exposed conditions at high altitudes but can also tolerate some dappled light. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, mirroring its native habitat with snowmelt and regular precipitation. Good drainage is crucial to prevent waterlogging, especially in cooler temperatures. |

## 🌱 Overview
Epilobium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae, containing about 197 species. The genus has a worldwide distribution. It is most prevalent in the subarctic, temperate and subantarctic regions, whereas in the subtropics and tropics Epilobium species are restricted to the cool montane biomes, such as the New Guinea Highlands.
The taxonomy of the genus has varied between different botanists, but the modern trend is to include the previously recognised genera Boisduvalia, Chamaenerion (previously Chamerion), Pyrogennema and Zauschneria within Epilobium according to Peter H. Raven, who has extensively studied the willowherbs and merges the other segregate genera into Epilobium. Fringed willowherb (Epilobium ciliatum) is likely a cryptic species complex; apparently these plants also commonly hybridize with their congeners.
Most species are known by the common name willowherbs for their willow-like leaves. Those that were once separated in Boisduvalia are called spike-primroses or boisduvalias. Those Epilobium species previously placed in the Chamaenerion group are known as fireweeds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in cool, moist environments with full sun to partial shade. Ensure its soil remains consistently damp but well-draining, replicating its high-altitude meadow and streambank origins. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is needed. It is adapted to nutrient-poor alpine soils; excessive feeding can be detrimental. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost application once a year is sufficient if desired.
