## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America (from Mexico south to Argentina) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. As a climbing vine, it can tolerate some direct morning sun if it has support. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged during the growing season, allowing the top inch or two to dry out between waterings. Reduce frequency slightly during cooler, less active periods. |

## Introduction
Cynanchum is a genus of about 300 species including some swallowworts, belonging to the family Apocynaceae. The taxon name comes from Greek kynos (meaning "dog") and anchein ("to choke"), hence the common name for several species is dog-strangling vine. Most species are non-succulent climbers or twiners. There is some evidence of toxicity.

## Care Guide
This tropical vine thrives in bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native forest habitat. Provide regular feeding during warmer months and slightly less water in cooler periods, ensuring proper drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize monthly during the active growing season (spring through summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Reduce or withhold in fall and winter.
