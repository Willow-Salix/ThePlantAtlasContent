## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet, bog-like soil conditions, mimicking its native seepage slope and wet flatwood habitats. Fertilize lightly with an acid-forming product to support its preference for nutrient-poor, acidic environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
