## Introduction
Harperocallis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Tofieldiaceae, native to Florida and northwestern South America. It was originally described as a monotypic genus, based on the Floridian H. flava, in 1968, but was expanded in 2013 to include ten South American species formerly placed in Isidrogalvia.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet, bog-like soil conditions, mimicking its native seepage slope and wet flatwood habitats. Fertilize lightly with an acid-forming product to support its preference for nutrient-poor, acidic environments.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization, ideally with an acid-forming fertilizer, as it naturally grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils.
