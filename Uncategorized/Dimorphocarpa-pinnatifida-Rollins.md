## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a native of arid desert regions, Tansy Spectaclepod thrives in full, intense sun and requires minimal water, tolerating drought conditions exceptionally well. It prefers well-draining, lean soil and needs little to no fertilization once established, making it an ideal low-maintenance plant for xeric landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; an annual light feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or none if planted in rich enough soil.
