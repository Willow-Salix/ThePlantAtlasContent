## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern California and Western Nevada (USA), particularly in the Sierra Nevada and White Mountains. |
| **Climate** | Arid Mountain / High Desert Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), tolerates intense sun exposure. |
| **Watering** | Very low; drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially once established. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
Volcanic buckwheat thrives in conditions mimicking its arid, rocky mountain native habitat. Provide full sun and extremely well-draining soil, watering sparingly to allow the soil to dry thoroughly between applications. Fertilization is generally not needed, as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Thrives in lean, well-draining soils and does not require frequent fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
