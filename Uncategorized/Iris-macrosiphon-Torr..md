## Care Guide
To care for the Bowltube Iris, provide full sun to partial shade and ensure excellent soil drainage. Water consistently during its active growth in cooler months, then allow it to remain dry through its summer dormancy. Fertilize minimally, favoring leaner soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soils. Fertilize sparingly in early spring if soil is particularly poor.
