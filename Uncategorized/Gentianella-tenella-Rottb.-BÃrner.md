## Care Guide
This dwarf gentian requires cool temperatures, high light exposure, and consistently moist but extremely well-drained, low-nutrient soil. Avoid waterlogging and excessive fertilization to successfully mimic its natural alpine and arctic habitats.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in low-nutrient soils; fertilize very sparingly with a diluted, balanced fertilizer, or not at all, as rich soils are detrimental.
