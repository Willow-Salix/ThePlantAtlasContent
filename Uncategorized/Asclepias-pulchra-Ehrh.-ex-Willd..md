## Introduction
Asclepias is a genus of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants known as milkweeds, named for their latex, a milky substance containing cardiac glycosides termed cardenolides, exuded where cells are damaged. Most species are toxic to humans and many other species, primarily due to the presence of cardenolides. However, as with many such plants, some species feed upon milkweed leaves or the nectar from their flowers. A noteworthy feeder on milkweeds is the monarch butterfly, which uses and requires certain milkweeds as host plants for its larvae.
The Asclepias genus contains over 200 species distributed broadly across Africa, North America, and South America. It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.

## Care Guide
Eastern Swamp Milkweed thrives in consistently wet conditions and full sun, mirroring its native wetland habitats. Ensure its soil remains perpetually moist to wet and provide ample light exposure for robust growth and an abundance of blooms, vital for attracting pollinators.

### Fertilizer
Prefers moderately fertile to rich, organic soils; an annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can support vigorous growth.
