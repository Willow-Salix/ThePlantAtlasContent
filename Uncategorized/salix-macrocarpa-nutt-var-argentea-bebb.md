## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (including Alaska, Canada, and the Western United States), specifically in riparian zones, wet meadows, and along stream banks. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool to cold temperate, subarctic, and montane regions, typically within temperate and boreal forest biomes, characterized by abundant moisture. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, as it commonly grows along open water margins or forest edges in its native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently wet to very moist soil; this plant is highly intolerant of drought, mimicking its native riparian environment with constant access to water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Salix lucida, the shining willow, Pacific willow, red willow, or whiplash willow, is a species of willow native to northern and western North America, occurring in wetland habitats. It is the largest willow found in British Columbia.
It is a deciduous large shrub or small tree growing to 4–15 metres (13–49 ft) tall. The shoots are greenish-brown to grey-brown. The leaves are narrow elliptic to lanceolate, 4–17 centimetres (1+1⁄2–6+1⁄2 in) long and 1–3.5 cm (1⁄2–1+1⁄2 in) broad, glossy dark green above, usually glaucous green below, hairless or thinly hairy. The flowers are yellow catkins 1–9 cm (1⁄2–3+1⁄2 in) long, produced in late spring after the leaves emerge.
The subspecies are:

S. l. lucida – shining willow, Newfoundland west to eastern Saskatchewan, and south to Maryland and South Dakota
S. l. lasiandra (Benth.) E.Murray (syn. S. lasiandra Benth.) – Pacific willow, Alaska east to Northwest Territory, and south to California and New Mexico.
S. l. caudata (Nutt.) E.Murray – whiplash willow, interior western North America from eastern British Columbia south to eastern California and Nevada, included in S. l. lasiandra by some authors.
It is closely related to Salix pentandra of Europe and Asia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This willow thrives in consistently wet to very moist soil conditions and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its care should mimic its native riparian habitat, ensuring ample water and fertile, organic-rich soil to support robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from rich, organic-laden soil, but generally does not require heavy or frequent fertilization if grown in suitable substrate.
