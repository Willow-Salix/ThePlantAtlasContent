## Care Guide
The Fewflower Nutrush thrives in full sun to partial shade within temperate climates, mimicking its native prairie and open woodland habitats. It requires consistently moist, well-drained, often acidic soils, and prefers lean conditions over nutrient-rich ones. Water regularly to ensure adequate moisture, but avoid over-fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; prefers lean, often sandy and acidic soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release formula.
