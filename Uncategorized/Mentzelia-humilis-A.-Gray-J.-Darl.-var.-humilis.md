## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Utah, Nevada, Arizona, California) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun, meaning at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open desert habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to completely dry out between waterings. Overwatering is detrimental. |

## Introduction
Mentzelia is a genus of about 100 species of flowering plants in the family Loasaceae, native to the Americas. The genus comprises annual, biennial, and perennial herbaceous plants and a few shrubs.
They are commonly called blazing stars or stickleafs; other names include evening stars and moonflowers.

## Care Guide
The Gypsum Blazingstar prefers a high-exposure, full sun environment with well-draining, lean soils. Mimicking its arid native habitat, it requires infrequent watering and has very low fertilizer needs. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor, mineral soils, so avoid rich fertilizers. A very dilute, balanced feed once annually in spring, or none at all, is generally sufficient.
