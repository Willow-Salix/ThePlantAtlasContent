## 🌱 Overview
Anthoxanthum (Latinised Greek for "yellow blossom"), commonly known as hornworts, vernal grasses, or vernalgrasses, is a genus of plants in the grass family. The  generic name means 'yellow flower' in Botanical Latin, referring to the colour of the mature spikelets.
The members of Anthoxanthum are widespread in temperate and subtropical parts of Africa and Eurasia, with a few species in tropical mountains. Some species have become naturalized in Australia, New Zealand, and the Americas. Anthoxanthum odoratum is a common species of acidic grassland and bogs in northern Europe. All the species reportedly contain the compound coumarin, used medicinally in many countries.
The genus Hierochloe is included in Anthoxanthum by some recent authors. Others, however, continue to treat them as separate genera, and we provisionally treat them as such here pending further research.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Puel's Vernal-grass is a resilient and adaptable plant, flourishing in full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering during its active growth but demonstrates strong drought tolerance once established. This grass is low-maintenance, needing minimal fertilization to thrive in various garden settings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a grass accustomed to natural grasslands, it does not require rich soil and can thrive with minimal nutrient input. A general-purpose, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth appears weak.
