# Adobe Popcornflower

*Allocarya granulata Piper* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (California, Oregon, USA) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Seasonal Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring direct and unobstructed sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Requires prolonged periods of standing water or very saturated soil during its active growth phase (winter/spring), followed by a complete drying out period in summer. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun with a very specific watering regimen: extensive flooding or saturation during cooler months, followed by a dry dormancy through summer. It prefers lean soils and requires minimal to no fertilization, mimicking its native vernal pool habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needs; thrives in naturally lean, often heavy clay or hardpan soils typical of vernal pools.
