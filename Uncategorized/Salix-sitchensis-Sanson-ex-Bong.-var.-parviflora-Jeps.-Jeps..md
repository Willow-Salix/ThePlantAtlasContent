## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, from Alaska south through British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California, particularly in riparian zones. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Wet Forest (Riparian Zones) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; thrives with good light exposure typical of forest edges or open wet areas. |
| **Watering** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil, does not tolerate drought. Mimic the constant water availability of stream banks and swamps. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This willow thrives in consistently wet conditions, mirroring its native riparian habitat in temperate western North America. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil remains constantly moist, as it is highly intolerant of dry periods. It prefers rich, moist soil for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from nutrient-rich, moist soils. A general-purpose slow-release fertilizer can support vigorous growth, especially if the soil is poor.
