## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains of Wyoming to northern New Mexico, east to the Black Hills of South Dakota and Nebraska) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane/Alpine Grasslands and Open Slopes |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), typical of open, exposed mountain slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out between sessions. Requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native habitat where water drains quickly. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native montane habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and avoid over-fertilizing due to its hemiparasitic nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Prefers lean, poor soils; rich soil can be detrimental. As a hemiparasite, it obtains much of its nutrients from host plants.
