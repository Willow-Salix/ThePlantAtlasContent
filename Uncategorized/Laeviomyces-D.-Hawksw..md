# Laeviomyces D. Hawksw.

*Laeviomyces D. Hawksw.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread, commonly found in temperate regions across continents, particularly in forests. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to indirect light. Thrives in shaded conditions, similar to under a dense forest canopy or on north-facing surfaces, avoiding direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture and high humidity are crucial. Requires regular watering or high ambient humidity, allowing the substrate to remain moist but not waterlogged, mimicking frequent rainfall or dew in a forest. |

## Care Guide
This organism prefers a cool, humid environment with low to indirect light, characteristic of its native temperate forest habitat. Maintain consistent moisture and high humidity, but provide minimal to no external nutrients, as it acquires resources from its specific substrate or host.

### Fertilizer
Very low. As an organism that derives nutrients from its host or substrate, external fertilization is likely unnecessary and could be harmful. Emulate nutrient-poor conditions found on typical lichen substrates.
