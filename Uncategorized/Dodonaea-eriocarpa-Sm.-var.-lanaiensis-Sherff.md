## Introduction
Dodonaea, commonly known as hop-bushes, is a genus of about 70 species of flowering plants in the soapberry family, Sapindaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate regions of Africa, the Americas, southern Asia and Australasia, but 59 species are endemic to Australia.
Plants in the genus Dodonaea are shrubs or small trees and often have sticky foliage, with simple or pinnate leaves arranged alternately along the stems. The flowers are male, female or bisexual and are borne in leaf axils or on the ends of branchlets and lack petals. The fruit is an angled or winged capsule.

## Care Guide
The 'A'ali'i (Dodonaea eriocarpa var. lanaiensis) is a hardy Hawaiian native that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and generally needs minimal fertilization. Its adaptability makes it a resilient plant for arid to mesic environments.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in nutrient-poor to moderate soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be given annually if growth is poor.
