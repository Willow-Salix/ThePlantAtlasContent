## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Europe, North Africa, Southwest Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during its active growth period in spring, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings; it tolerates drier conditions as it matures towards the end of its life cycle. |

## 🌱 Overview
Anthoxanthum (Latinised Greek for "yellow blossom"), commonly known as hornworts, vernal grasses, or vernalgrasses, is a genus of plants in the grass family. The  generic name means 'yellow flower' in Botanical Latin, referring to the colour of the mature spikelets.
The members of Anthoxanthum are widespread in temperate and subtropical parts of Africa and Eurasia, with a few species in tropical mountains. Some species have become naturalized in Australia, New Zealand, and the Americas. Anthoxanthum odoratum is a common species of acidic grassland and bogs in northern Europe. All the species reportedly contain the compound coumarin, used medicinally in many countries.
The genus Hierochloe is included in Anthoxanthum by some recent authors. Others, however, continue to treat them as separate genera, and we provisionally treat them as such here pending further research.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Annual Vernalgrass thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering during its active spring growth, tolerating drier conditions as it matures. It is adaptable to various soil types and generally does not require extensive fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant suitable for sunny, open locations.
