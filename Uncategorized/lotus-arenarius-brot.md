## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Mediterranean native thrives in full sun and very well-draining sandy soils, requiring moderate watering with significant dry periods between. It is highly drought-tolerant and has low fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it suited for low-maintenance, dry garden conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a leguminous plant, it fixes nitrogen, making supplemental nitrogen generally unnecessary. A very dilute, balanced fertilizer might be applied once or twice during the growing season if growth appears poor, but it typically thrives without heavy feeding.
