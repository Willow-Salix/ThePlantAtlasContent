| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Forests, Boreal Forests, Subalpine/Subarctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light; avoid direct sunlight which can cause desiccation. Thrives in shaded or partially shaded conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist conditions are essential. Requires frequent misting and regular watering to keep the substrate damp, but not waterlogged. High ambient humidity is crucial. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lophozia requires a cool, humid environment with low to indirect light, mimicking its native forest and tundra habitats. Maintain consistently moist conditions through frequent misting and regular watering, ensuring good drainage to prevent rot. Fertilization is generally not needed due to their low nutrient requirements.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Bryophytes obtain sufficient nutrients from water and decaying organic matter; strong fertilizers can be harmful. If absolutely necessary, use a highly diluted, specialized bryophyte or epiphytic fertilizer very sparingly.
