## Care Guide
This ephemeral annual thrives in full sun with consistent moisture during its brief spring growth period in well-drained, sandy, acidic soil. It requires a dry dormancy during the hot summer months and minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilization, as it naturally occurs in nutrient-poor, sandy, acidic soils; use a very dilute, balanced fertilizer if absolutely necessary during active growth.
