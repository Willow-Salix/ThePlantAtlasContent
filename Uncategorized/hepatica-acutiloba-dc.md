## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sharp-lobed Hepatica thrives in a temperate deciduous forest environment, requiring partial to full shade once trees leaf out and consistently moist, well-drained, organically rich soil. Mimic its native habitat by providing adequate moisture in spring and allowing for a period of drier soil during its summer dormancy.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from rich, organic soil or an annual top-dressing of compost/leaf mold in early spring.
