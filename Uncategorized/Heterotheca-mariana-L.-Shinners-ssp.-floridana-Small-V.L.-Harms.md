## Care Guide
The Florida Goldenaster prefers full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, mimicking its native pine woodland and scrub habitats. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing as it is adapted to lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native to nutrient-poor, sandy soils, this plant does not require rich soil and can be sensitive to excessive nutrients.
