## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South America (Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Grassland / Pampas |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, consistent with open grassland habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, mimicking seasonal rainfall patterns. Water regularly during dry periods, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings, but tolerates some drought once established. |

## Introduction
Schizachyrium is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words σχίζειν (schizein), meaning "to split," and ἄχυρον (achyron), meaning "chaff." It refers to either the glume or the toothed lemmas.
In the United States, members of the genus are commonly known as bluestems.

## Care Guide
This bluestem thrives in full sun, reflecting its origin in open South American grasslands. It requires moderate watering, preferring consistent moisture during growth but tolerating dry spells. Fertilization should be light, as overly rich soil can lead to leggy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Native grassland soils are not overly rich; a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring is generally sufficient.
