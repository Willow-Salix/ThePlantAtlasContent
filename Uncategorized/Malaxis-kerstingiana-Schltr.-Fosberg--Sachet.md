| **Native Origin** | Tropical West and Central Africa (e.g., Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest / Tropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light or dappled shade, mimicking its natural habitat on the forest floor. |

## Introduction
Malaxis, commonly called adder's mouth, is a genus of terrestrial and semiepiphytic orchids. The generic name signifies "smooth" and alludes to the tender texture of the leaves. There are approximately 182 species, found mostly in tropics but with some species in temperate regions.

## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid requires consistent moisture and high humidity, typical of its native tropical rainforest environment. Provide low to medium indirect light and ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Fertilize regularly with a weak orchid-specific solution during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Apply a weak, balanced orchid-specific liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season, reducing frequency in cooler or dormant periods.
