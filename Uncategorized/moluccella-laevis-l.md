Moluccella laevis, the Bells-of-Ireland, Bells of Ireland, Molucca balmis, shellflower or shell flower, is a summer flowering annual, native to Turkey, Syria and the Caucasus. It is cultivated for its spikes of flowers. In the language of flowers, it represents luck.
The tiny white flowers are surrounded by apple green calyces which are persistent. The rounded leaves are pale green.
Fast growing, Moluccella laevis will reach 1 metre (3.28 feet) and spread to 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) with an erect, branching habit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, Bells of Ireland require full sun and well-draining soil, similar to their native Mediterranean habitat. Ensure consistent moisture during their active growth cycle, allowing brief drying between waterings, and fertilize lightly to promote robust flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Amend soil with compost at planting. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer can be applied monthly at half strength during the active growing season, but avoid over-fertilization.
