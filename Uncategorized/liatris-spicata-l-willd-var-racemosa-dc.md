## 🌱 Overview
Blazing Star is a shoot 'em up video game developed by Yumekobo and published by SNK in 1998 for the Neo Geo arcade and home systems. It is a follow-up to Pulstar (1995) and features side-scrolling action similar to its predecessor and different ships with varying characteristics. It was made less challenging than its predecessor, and the graphic quality was improved upon.
The game was released to mixed reviews. It was commended for its graphics and boss design, and for keeping the Neo Geo shooter scene alive. It has received greater recognition in retrospective reviews when re-released on smartphones and home consoles through the ACA Neo Geo series. Critics continued to praise the boss battles and graphics, but criticized the uneven stage design.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil to mimic its native prairie habitat. Water regularly, especially during dry periods, and fertilize sparingly in spring to promote healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It thrives in naturally fertile prairie soils; a light application of balanced fertilizer or compost in spring is sufficient, avoiding excessive feeding.
