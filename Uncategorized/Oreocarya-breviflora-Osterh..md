## Introduction
Oreocarya (perennial cat's-eye) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. There are about 63 species and its native range extends from western and central Canada, through western United States to north Mexico. It is part of subtribe of Amsinckiinae.
It was once thought to be a either a subgenus or synonym of Cryptantha Lehm. ex G. Don, as they both had plenty of tiny flowers, hairy leaves, and persisting dried flower stems.
Botanist William Alfred Weber later noted that the 2 genera were different in form as Oreocarya was a "biennial or perennial from rosettes of basal leaves; flowers more than 5 mm in diameter, often distinctly long-tubular with prominent yellow eye", while Cryptantha was an "annual without rosettes of basal leaves; flowers minute, less than 5 mm diameter, short-tubed with inconspicuous eye".

## Care Guide
This arid-adapted plant requires full sun and extremely well-drained soil to thrive. Water very sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out entirely between waterings, and fertilize rarely if ever. Mimicking its dry, sunny native habitat is key to its success.

### Fertilizer
Very low; native to lean soils. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted, balanced fertilizer, or not at all once established.
