## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in cool temperate conditions with consistently wet soil, making it ideal for bog gardens or pond margins. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure the substrate never dries out to mimic its natural wetland habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied during the growing season if soil is poor.
