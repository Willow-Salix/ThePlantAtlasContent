## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
James' Willow thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently wet to moist soil, mirroring its native wetland habitats. Ensure regular watering and never allow the soil to dry out completely. A moderate application of balanced fertilizer in spring will support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer applied in early spring, particularly if soil nutrients are low. Generally not a heavy feeder.
