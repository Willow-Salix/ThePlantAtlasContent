## Care Guide
The Grassy Croton thrives in conditions replicating its native Caribbean dry forest habitat, requiring ample bright light and moderate watering. Ensure well-draining soil and allow it to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent root issues. Fertilize during active growth, reducing frequency in cooler months.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring through summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer. Less frequent or no fertilization during dormant periods.
