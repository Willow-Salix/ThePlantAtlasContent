| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Northern California, USA (specifically Marin, Napa, Sonoma counties) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland (Chaparral) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; water regularly during its first growing season. After establishment, water sparingly, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in summer. Requires excellent drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Silver Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean chaparral habitat. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering. As a nitrogen fixer, it generally needs little to no supplemental fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. If soil is very poor, a low-phosphorus, balanced fertilizer may be used very sparingly.
