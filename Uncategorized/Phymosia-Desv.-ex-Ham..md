## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico, Central America, Southwestern United States |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Dry Forest and Montane Scrubland, characterized by warm temperatures with distinct wet and dry seasons. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers ample light but may benefit from some afternoon shade in extremely hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Water regularly during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Significantly reduce watering during the dry season or winter dormancy, as it is drought-tolerant once established. |

## Care Guide
Phymosia thrives in sunny, well-draining conditions mimicking its native dry forest and scrubland habitats. Provide consistent watering during its growing season, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and reduce water significantly in winter. Light fertilization supports healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring, or a diluted liquid feed monthly during the active growing season. Avoid over-fertilization.
