## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient montane perennial thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions characteristic of its native high-altitude meadows. It requires moderate watering during its growth season, tolerating drought once established, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization. Mimicking its natural environment with ample light and good drainage is key for its successful cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich soil.
