| **🌍 Origin** | Caribbean islands (e.g., Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic), Central America, and northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Venezuela) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Dry Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) for best fruit production. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular and consistent watering during the growing and fruiting seasons, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Established trees are drought-tolerant but perform best with adequate moisture. Ensure excellent drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Melicoccus bijugatus is a fruit-bearing tree in the soapberry family Sapindaceae, native or naturalized across the New World tropics including South and Central America, and parts of the Caribbean.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spanish Lime thrives in full sun and requires consistent watering during its active growth and fruiting phases, though mature plants exhibit good drought tolerance. Provide moderate fertilization, particularly when fruiting, and ensure well-drained, fertile soil for optimal growth and abundant fruit production.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to heavy feeding with a balanced fertilizer, especially during active growth and fruiting periods. Benefits from fertile, well-drained soil rich in organic matter.
