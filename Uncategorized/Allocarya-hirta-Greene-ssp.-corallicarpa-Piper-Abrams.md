# Coral-fruited Hairy Popcornflower

*Allocarya hirta Greene ssp. corallicarpa (Piper) Abrams* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (primarily Central Coast, South Coast, and San Francisco Bay Area) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Vernal Pool/Seasonal Wetland) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. This plant thrives in bright, open conditions, typical of its native seasonal wetlands that lack significant tree canopy. |
| **Watering** | High watering needs during its active growing season (typically winter through late spring), requiring consistently moist to wet soil. Once the plant sets seed and naturally dies back in late spring/early summer, a dry period is essential, mimicking its vernal pool habitat. |

## Care Guide
This annual plant thrives with full sun exposure and requires abundant water to maintain consistently moist to wet soil during its active growth period from winter to late spring. Mimic its native vernal pool environment by allowing the soil to dry out completely in summer as the plant completes its life cycle. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum or avoided entirely.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Native to nutrient-poor vernal pool soils, this plant does not require rich fertilization and may be harmed by excessive nutrients. If desired, a very diluted, low-phosphorus fertilizer can be applied sparingly during active growth.
