## Introduction
Salix aurita, the eared willow, is a species of willow distributed over much of Europe, and occasionally cultivated. It is a shrub to 2.5 m in height, distinguished from the similar but slightly larger Salix cinerea by its reddish petioles and young twigs. It was named for its persistent kidney-shaped stipules along the shoots.

## Care Guide
The Eared Willow thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native boggy habitats. It prefers full sun to partial shade and benefits from nutrient-rich soil, with an annual spring fertilization being sufficient. Ensuring constant moisture is paramount for its health.

### Fertilizer
