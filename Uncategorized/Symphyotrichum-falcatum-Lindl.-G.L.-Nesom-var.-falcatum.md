| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western and Central North America, specifically the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Prairie |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open grassland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering during dry periods, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings. Tolerant of moderate drought once established, but avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).

## Care Guide
This prairie aster thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native open grassland habitat. Water regularly when dry, but ensure good drainage as it dislikes wet feet. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to naturally rich prairie soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost annually in spring is generally sufficient for its naturally fertile prairie soil origins.
