## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including the Intermountain West and Great Plains of the United States (e.g., Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Utah, Nevada) and parts of Canada. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Sagebrush Steppe / Semi-Arid Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure is essential, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, as it naturally grows in open, exposed landscapes. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly and infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its native arid environment with low rainfall. |

## Introduction
Atriplex () is a plant genus of about 250 species, known by the common names of saltbush and orache (; also spelled orach). It belongs to the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae s.l.. 
The genus is quite variable and widely distributed. It includes many desert and seashore plants and halophytes, as well as plants of moist environments. 
The generic name originated in Latin and was applied by Pliny the Elder to the edible oraches. The name saltbush derives from the fact that the plants retain salt in their leaves; they are able to grow in areas affected by soil salination.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, often poor soils, typical of its native arid scrubland habitat. Minimal watering is required once established, and it generally does not need fertilization, preferring lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor, often saline or alkaline soils, so supplemental fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental to this hardy plant.
