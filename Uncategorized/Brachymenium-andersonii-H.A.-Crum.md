# Anderson's Brachymenium Moss

*Brachymenium andersonii H.A. Crum* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico, Central America, Caribbean, and northern South America |
| **Climate** | Humid Tropical and Subtropical Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium, indirect light. Protect from direct, intense sun which can scorch and dry it. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged, ensuring good drainage. Requires high ambient humidity, so frequent misting or a terrarium environment is beneficial. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in conditions mimicking its native humid tropical and subtropical forest habitat. Provide consistent moisture, high humidity, and low to medium indirect light, avoiding direct sun. Minimal fertilization is required, focusing instead on maintaining a perpetually moist yet well-drained environment.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is needed. If used, apply a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly, perhaps once or twice a year.
