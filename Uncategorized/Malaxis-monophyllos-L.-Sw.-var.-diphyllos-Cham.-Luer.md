## Introduction
Malaxis, commonly called adder's mouth, is a genus of terrestrial and semiepiphytic orchids. The generic name signifies "smooth" and alludes to the tender texture of the leaves. There are approximately 182 species, found mostly in tropics but with some species in temperate regions.

## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid thrives in cool, moist, shaded conditions typical of North American temperate forests. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and should be protected from direct sunlight. Feed lightly during active growth to support its humus-rich soil preference.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced, diluted fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) during its active growing season. It naturally grows in humus-rich, often calcareous soils.
