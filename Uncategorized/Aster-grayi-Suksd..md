## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically the Pacific Northwest, including Oregon, Washington, parts of Idaho, Montana, and northern California). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland and Grassland (found in dry-mesic open woods, clearings, and meadows). |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in locations with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, but can tolerate some afternoon shade, particularly in hotter regions. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. As a plant from dry-mesic habitats, it is drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic natural rainfall patterns. |

## Care Guide
Gray's Aster is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering, and has minimal fertilizer needs. Mimic its native temperate woodland and grassland conditions for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to average to poor soils typical of its native habitat. Minimal or no fertilization is usually needed; an annual top-dressing with compost or a very light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth is poor.
