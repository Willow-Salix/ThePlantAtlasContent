## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Cool-temperate coastal regions of Western North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest) and Northern Europe. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool-Temperate Coastal |
| **☀️ Light** | Moderate to bright indirect light. Tolerates some exposure on rocks or trees, but benefits from partial shade to help maintain ambient humidity and prevent desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High atmospheric humidity is critical for this lichen. It absorbs water directly from the air, requiring frequent misting or placement in a high-humidity environment (e.g., terrarium) to rehydrate its thallus. Avoid traditional watering of a substrate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rinodina is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 265 species. It is hypothesized that a few saxicolous species common to dry regions of western North America, southern Europe, North Africa and central Asia may date back 240 million years to the Middle Triassic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rinodina applanata thrives in cool, humid conditions with moderate to bright indirect light. Its care revolves around providing consistent high atmospheric moisture through frequent misting, as it absorbs water directly from the air. Traditional fertilizers should be avoided entirely.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens are sensitive to nutrient imbalances and absorb trace nutrients directly from rain and atmospheric dust; traditional fertilizers can be detrimental.
