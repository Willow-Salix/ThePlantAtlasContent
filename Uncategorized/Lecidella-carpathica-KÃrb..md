## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe (e.g., Carpathian Mountains, Alps), extending to other temperate montane areas globally. |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Montane Temperate |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers high light exposure, often found on open, exposed rock surfaces in mountainous terrain. |
| **Watering** | Requires ambient moisture from rain, dew, or humidity for rehydration, tolerating periods of desiccation. Traditional watering is not applicable; focus on high ambient humidity or occasional misting for cultivation. |

## Care Guide
Lecidella carpathica thrives in bright, exposed conditions mimicking its native montane habitats. It requires high ambient humidity or occasional rehydration from mist, but can withstand dry periods. No fertilization is needed as it obtains nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens are self-sufficient, deriving trace nutrients from atmospheric deposition and their rock substrate.
