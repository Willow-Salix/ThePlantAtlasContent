## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Australia (New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania), New Zealand, South America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires filtered light to moderate shade; avoids direct, intense sunlight which can cause desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Needs high ambient humidity and consistent moisture, mimicking frequent rainfall and fog. Absorb water from the air and rain, so regular misting or placement in a humid environment is crucial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hypogymnia is a genus of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. They are commonly known as tube lichens, bone lichens, or pillow lichens. Most species lack rhizines (root-like attachment organs on the lower surface) that are otherwise common in members of the Parmeliaceae, and have swollen lobes that are usually hollow. Other common characteristics are relatively small spores and the presence of physodic acid and related lichen products. The lichens usually grow on the bark and wood of coniferous trees.
Hypogymnia was proposed by lichenologist William Nylander, first as a subgenus of Parmelia in 1881, and 15 years later as a distinct genus of two species, including the widespread and common type species, Hypogymnia physodes. It has since grown to about 90 recognized species. Hypogymnia has a centre of biodiversity in China, where many of its species are found.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen thrives in cool, humid conditions with filtered light, typical of temperate rainforests. Provide consistent moisture through high humidity or frequent misting, and avoid direct sun exposure or the use of any fertilizers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not required; lichens obtain nutrients from the air and rainwater. Chemical fertilizers can be detrimental.
