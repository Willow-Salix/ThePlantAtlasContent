## Introduction
Setaria is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family. The name is derived from the Latin word seta, meaning "bristle" or "hair", which refers to the bristly spikelets.
The genus includes over 100 species distributed in many tropical and temperate regions around the world, and members are commonly known as foxtail or bristle grasses.

## Care Guide
West Indian Bristlegrass thrives in full sun and warm temperatures, typical of its native tropical and subtropical grassland environments. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization as it prefers average soil.

### Fertilizer
Low; this plant thrives in average to poor soils and does not require rich nutrients or heavy fertilization.
