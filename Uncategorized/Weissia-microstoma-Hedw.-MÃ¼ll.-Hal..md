## Care Guide
This moss thrives in temperate conditions with consistent moisture and partial to dappled sunlight. It requires very little in terms of nutrients, often growing on bare soil or rock surfaces. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Minimal to no fertilization needed, as mosses are not heavy feeders and can thrive on nutrient-poor substrates.
