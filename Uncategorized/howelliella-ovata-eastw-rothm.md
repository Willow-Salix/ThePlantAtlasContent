# Ovateleaf Snapdragon
### *Howelliella ovata (Eastw.) Rothm.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Southern California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Woodland and Chaparral (often in moist, shaded sites within this biome) |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to indirect bright light. It naturally grows in the understory or shaded clearings, so direct, intense sun should be avoided. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is key. The plant prefers moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its native habitat in 'moist places'. Water regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly before rewatering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Howelliella is a monotypic genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It only contains one species, Howelliella ovata.
It is native to California.
The genus name of Howelliella is in honour of John Thomas Howell (1903–1994), an American botanist and taxonomist, and the Latin specific epithet of ovata refers to ovate, from ovum meaning egg.
Both genus and species were first described and published in 1954.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native habitat in California's woodlands and chaparral. Regular watering is essential, especially during warmer months, and a light feeding during its active growth will promote healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer can be applied every 4-6 weeks during its active growing season (spring through early summer) to support robust growth.
