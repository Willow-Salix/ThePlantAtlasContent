## Care Guide
Palm Grass thrives in humid, shaded conditions, preferring consistently moist soil. Provide low to medium indirect light, protecting it from direct sun, and feed with a diluted fertilizer during its active growth. Ensure high humidity to prevent leaf crisping.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; use a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer monthly during the growing season (spring and summer) to support lush foliage.
