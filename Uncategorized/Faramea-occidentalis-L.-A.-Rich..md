## Care Guide
To thrive, Faramea occidentalis requires consistent moisture and high humidity, replicating its tropical rainforest origins. Provide indirect bright light or partial shade and fertilize moderately during active growth. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot while keeping the soil evenly moist.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, perhaps diluted to half strength, due to rapid nutrient cycling in native soils.
