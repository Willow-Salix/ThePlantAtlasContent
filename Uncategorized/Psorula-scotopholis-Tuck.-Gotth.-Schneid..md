## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar and high alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America (e.g., Alaska, Greenland, Rocky Mountains), Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Alps), and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers exposed conditions, tolerating full sun to partial sun, typical of open tundra environments with periods of bright light and cloud cover. |
| **Watering** | Receives moisture primarily from atmospheric sources (rain, snowmelt, fog, dew); highly desiccation-tolerant, requiring long dry periods between infrequent moisture events and suffering from excessive or constant wetness. |

## Introduction
Psorula is a fungal genus in the family Psoraceae. It is a monotypic genus, containing the single lichen species Psorula rufonigra. The genus was circumscribed by German lichenologist Gotthard Schneider in 1980.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cold, exposed, and nutrient-poor alpine or arctic environments. Provide infrequent atmospheric moisture, avoid conventional fertilizers, and ensure tolerance for strong light, cold temperatures, and long dry spells to mimic its natural habitat.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient needs, deriving trace elements from atmospheric deposition and its substrate; conventional fertilizers are detrimental and should be avoided.
