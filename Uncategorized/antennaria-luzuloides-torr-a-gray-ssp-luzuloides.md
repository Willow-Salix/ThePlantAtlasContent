| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (primarily Western United States and parts of southwestern Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine Arid to Semi-Arid (e.g., dry, open slopes, sagebrush steppe, open ponderosa pine forests) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives with high light exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; drought-tolerant and prefers soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its dry native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rush Pussytoes thrives in conditions similar to its native arid montane and steppe environments. Provide full sun to partial sun and very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between sessions. It prefers lean soils and requires minimal to no fertilization to flourish.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils and generally requires minimal to no fertilization.
