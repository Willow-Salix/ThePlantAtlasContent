## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Japan (Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodlands and Mountain Slopes |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun for optimal flowering, tolerating partial shade. In its native habitat, it thrives in open woodlands or forest edges where it receives good light. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular and consistent moisture, especially during the growing season and dry spells. The soil should be well-drained, reflecting its native habitat with moderate, consistent rainfall, but avoiding waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Weigela  is a genus of between six and 38 species of deciduous shrubs in the family Caprifoliaceae, growing to 1–5 m (3–15′) tall. All are natives of eastern Asia. The genus is named after the German scientist Christian Ehrenfried Weigel.

## Care Guide
The Japanese Weigela flourishes in conditions similar to its native temperate woodlands, favoring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Ensure regular watering during dry periods and apply a light spring fertilization to promote robust growth and plentiful blooms.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, particularly if the soil is poor. Native temperate woodland soils are often moderately fertile, enriched by decaying organic matter.
