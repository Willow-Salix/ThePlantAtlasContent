## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant flourishes in full sun and requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot. It is very drought-tolerant, so water only when the soil is completely dry. Minimal fertilization is necessary, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor native soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Native to lean, rocky soils, it does not require rich nutrients. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient if desired, or none at all.
