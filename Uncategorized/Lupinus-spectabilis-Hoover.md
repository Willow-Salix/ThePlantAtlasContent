## Care Guide
Shaggyhair lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native semi-arid Mediterranean climate. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal water and low fertilizer, particularly avoiding high nitrogen. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in moderately fertile to poor, well-draining soils. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.
