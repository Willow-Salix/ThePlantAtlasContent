## Care Guide
Pilea obtusata thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical understory habitat, requiring bright indirect light and high humidity. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil and fertilize sparingly during active growth to support its lush foliage.

### Fertilizer
Feed with a diluted balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., half-strength) every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer), reducing frequency in fall and winter.
