## Introduction
Achillea  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The plants typically have frilly leaves and are known colloquially as yarrows, although this common name usually refers to A. millefolium. The genus was named after the Greek mythological character Achilles, whose soldiers were said to have used yarrow to treat their wounds; this is reflected by common names such as allheal and bloodwort. The genus is native primarily to Eurasia and North America.

## Care Guide
Western Yarrow is a robust plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its origins in open, often dry, western North American landscapes. It requires minimal watering once established and generally needs little to no fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for sunny gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typically thrives in average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization. Excess nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
