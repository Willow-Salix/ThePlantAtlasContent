## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Kāwa'u palm, native to Oʻahu's dryland forests, thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering during its active growth period, allowing for slight drying between applications. It benefits from moderate fertilization to support its growth in cultivation, mimicking the nutrient availability of its natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Apply a balanced, slow-release palm fertilizer 2-3 times during the growing season (spring to early autumn).
