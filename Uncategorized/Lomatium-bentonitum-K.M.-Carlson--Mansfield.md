## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Columbia Basin, Washington State, USA |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-arid Grassland (specifically on bentonite clay outcrops) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in exposed, barren areas with no overhead canopy. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent watering; highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, typical of desert or semi-arid conditions. |

## Introduction
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires very little water, mimicking its native arid, barren bentonite soil habitat. Avoid overwatering and excessive fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. The key is to replicate its dry, sun-drenched, and lean native environment.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, eroded bentonite clay soils.
