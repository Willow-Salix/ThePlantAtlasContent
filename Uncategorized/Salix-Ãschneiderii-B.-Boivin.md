## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This fast-growing hybrid willow thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native wetland habitat. While adaptable, a moderate feeding regime supports its vigorous growth. Provide ample space and moisture for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially for promoting vigorous growth.
