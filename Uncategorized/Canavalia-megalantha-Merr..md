## Introduction
Canavalia is a genus of plants in the legume family (Fabaceae) that comprises approximately 73 species of tropical vines. Members of the genus are commonly known as jack-beans. It has a pantropical distribution.
The species of Canavalia endemic to the Hawaiian Islands were named ʻāwikiwiki by the Native Hawaiians. The name translates to "the very quick one" and comes from the Hawaiian word for "fast". The genus name is derived from the Malabar word for the species, kavavali, which means "forest climber".

## Care Guide
This tropical plant thrives in conditions similar to its native Philippine rainforests, requiring abundant light and consistent moisture. Ensure well-draining soil and provide moderate fertilization during its active growth period to support its vigorous nature.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen may not be necessary.
