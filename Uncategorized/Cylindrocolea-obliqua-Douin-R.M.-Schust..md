*Cylindrocolea obliqua (Douin) R.M. Schust.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and southeastern North America (e.g., Florida, Louisiana). |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Humid Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light to dappled shade, mimicking a dense forest understory or shaded rock crevices. Avoid any direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Constant high humidity and consistently moist substrate are crucial. Water frequently to keep the surface damp but not waterlogged; misting regularly is beneficial. |

## Care Guide
This liverwort requires consistently high humidity and very low light conditions, typical of a forest floor. Maintain a constantly moist (but not waterlogged) substrate and avoid any direct sun to ensure its survival and growth.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to none. Liverworts thrive on minimal nutrients from decaying organic matter or mineral surfaces; over-fertilization can be detrimental.
