## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caribbean (e.g., Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico), Mexico, Central America, northern South America (e.g., Venezuela, Colombia), and southernmost Florida (USA) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Dry Forest / Semi-Arid Tropical Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires high light exposure, typical of open scrublands and dry forests where it grows without significant canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low. Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during dry seasons or cooler months, mimicking its native rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Vachellia is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae, commonly known as thorn trees or acacias. It belongs to the subfamily Mimosoideae. Its species were considered members of genus Acacia until 2009. Vachellia can be distinguished from other acacias by its capitate inflorescences and spinescent stipules. Before discovery of the New World, Europeans in the Mediterranean region were familiar with several species of Vachellia, which they knew as sources of medicine, and had names for them that they inherited from the Greeks and Romans.
The wide-ranging genus occurs in a variety of open, tropical to subtropical habitats, and is locally dominant. In parts of Africa, Vachellia species are shaped progressively by grazing animals of increasing size and height, such as gazelle, gerenuk, and giraffe. The genus in Africa has thus developed thorns in defence against such herbivory.

## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun and well-draining soil, this drought-tolerant species mimics its native subtropical dry forest habitat. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to fully dry between waterings, and significantly reduce during cooler periods. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Low. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally thrives in nutrient-poor soils and requires minimal fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season if soil is particularly infertile.
