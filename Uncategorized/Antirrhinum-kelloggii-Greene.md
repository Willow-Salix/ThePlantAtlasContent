## Introduction
Antirrhinum is a genus of plants in the Plantaginaceae family, commonly known as dragon flowers or snapdragons because of the flowers' fancied resemblance to the face of a dragon that opens and closes its mouth when laterally squeezed. They are also sometimes called toadflax or dog flower. They are native to rocky areas of Europe, the United States, Canada, and North Africa. Antirrhinum species are widely used as ornamental plants in borders and as cut flowers.

## Care Guide
Kellogg's Snapdragon thrives in conditions similar to its native Mediterranean scrubland, requiring full sun and well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant and needs infrequent watering, particularly during its summer dormancy. Provide minimal fertilization to avoid over-enrichment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; native soils are often lean. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, slow-release formula in spring, or amend with compost.
