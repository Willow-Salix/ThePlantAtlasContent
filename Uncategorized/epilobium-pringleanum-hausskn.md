## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including Alaska, western Canada (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland), and the western United States (California, Arizona, New Mexico). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane to Alpine |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, favoring bright conditions found in open slopes and meadows. |
| **💧 Water** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native habitat along stream banks and in wet meadows. Avoid drying out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Epilobium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae, containing about 197 species. The genus has a worldwide distribution. It is most prevalent in the subarctic, temperate and subantarctic regions, whereas in the subtropics and tropics Epilobium species are restricted to the cool montane biomes, such as the New Guinea Highlands.
The taxonomy of the genus has varied between different botanists, but the modern trend is to include the previously recognised genera Boisduvalia, Chamaenerion (previously Chamerion), Pyrogennema and Zauschneria within Epilobium according to Peter H. Raven, who has extensively studied the willowherbs and merges the other segregate genera into Epilobium. Fringed willowherb (Epilobium ciliatum) is likely a cryptic species complex; apparently these plants also commonly hybridize with their congeners.
Most species are known by the common name willowherbs for their willow-like leaves. Those that were once separated in Boisduvalia are called spike-primroses or boisduvalias. Those Epilobium species previously placed in the Chamaenerion group are known as fireweeds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pringle's Willowherb thrives in cool, moist environments characteristic of its montane to alpine native range. It requires consistent soil moisture and can tolerate full sun to partial shade. Minimal fertilization is typically needed, as it is adapted to leaner, well-draining soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring may support growth, but it's generally adapted to nutrient-lean, well-draining soils.
