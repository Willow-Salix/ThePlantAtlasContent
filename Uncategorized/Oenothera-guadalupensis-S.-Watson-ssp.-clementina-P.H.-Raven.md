## Introduction
Oenothera is a genus of about 145 species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas. It is the type genus of the family Onagraceae.  Common names include evening primrose, suncups, and sundrops. They are not closely related to the true primroses (genus Primula).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean coastal scrub habitat. Water moderately during its growing season, reducing frequency during dry summer dormancy. It requires minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization, if any, as native soils in its habitat are often lean. Over-fertilization can harm the plant.
