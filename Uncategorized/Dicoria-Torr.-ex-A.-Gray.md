## Care Guide
Dicoria thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland and desert habitat. Provide full, direct sun and water sparingly, allowing the soil to fully dry out between sessions. It requires minimal fertilization, tolerating poor soil conditions well.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; a very light feeding once a year in spring, or none at all in nutrient-poor potting mixes.
