| **Native Origin** | India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun, but can tolerate partial sun conditions, reflecting its natural habitat as a canopy tree in regions with high light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. It is adapted to distinct wet and dry seasons and can tolerate periods of drought once established. |

## Introduction
Terminalia is a genus of large trees of the flowering plant family Combretaceae, comprising nearly 300 species distributed in tropical regions of the world. The genus name derives from the Latin word terminus, referring to the fact that the leaves appear at the very tips of the shoots.
Axlewood (T. latifolia) is used for its wood and tannins and as a fodder. African birch (T. leiocarpa) is used for its wood and to make yellow dye and medicinal compounds. A yellow dyestuff produced from the leaves of T. leiocarpa has traditionally been used in West Africa to dye leather.

## Care Guide
Gum Ghatti thrives in full to partial sun conditions, mirroring its native tropical dry deciduous forest environment. It requires moderate, well-drained watering, tolerating drought once established, and benefits from moderate fertilization during its growth phase to support its robust nature.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied during the active growing season, but over-fertilization should be avoided as it's adapted to moderate nutrient soils.
