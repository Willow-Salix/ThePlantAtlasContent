## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Festive Sedge flourishes in temperate mountain climates, preferring consistently moist to wet soil and adaptable to full sun or partial shade. Mimic its natural habitat by ensuring regular watering to prevent the soil from drying out. It is relatively low-maintenance, requiring only light fertilization if soil quality is poor.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in moderately rich organic soils. A light annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer is sufficient if soil nutrients are low.
