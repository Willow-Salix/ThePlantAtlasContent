## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Alaska), Europe, and East Asia (e.g., Japan, China). |
| **Climate** | Cool-Temperate Humid Forest or Temperate Moist Environments |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; avoid direct sunlight which can cause desiccation. Thrives in dappled shade or consistently shaded environments. |
| **Watering** | Maintain consistently moist conditions for the substrate, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. High ambient humidity is crucial; regular misting or placement in a high-humidity environment (e.g., terrarium) is beneficial. |

## Care Guide
This moss requires a cool, humid environment with low to medium indirect light, mimicking its native habitat on shaded rocks and forest floors. Maintain a consistently moist substrate without waterlogging, and ensure high ambient humidity, potentially through misting or a terrarium. Fertilization is not necessary and can be harmful.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses do not require fertilization. Excess nutrients can be detrimental, as they primarily absorb elements from their substrate, water, and air.
