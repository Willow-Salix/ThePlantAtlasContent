## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions and mountains across temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere, including Western Europe (e.g., British Isles), North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest), and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coastal / Maritime and Sub-alpine biomes, characterized by open, exposed conditions, often with rocky or sandy, well-draining soils. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. Native to open, exposed coastal cliffs and high-altitude areas without significant canopy cover, indicating a need for maximum light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate, drought-tolerant once established. It thrives in well-draining soils that dry out quickly, reflecting its natural habitat on coastal bluffs and rocky slopes with moderate rainfall and good drainage. |

## Introduction
Armeria maritima, the thrift, sea thrift or sea pink, is a species of flowering plant in the family Plumbaginaceae. It is a compact evergreen perennial which grows in low clumps and sends up long stems that support globes of bright pink flowers. In some cases purple, white or red flowers also occur. It is a popular garden flower and has been distributed worldwide as a garden and cut flower.  It does well in gardens designed as xeriscapes or rock gardens. The Latin specific epithet maritima means pertaining to the sea or coastal.

## Care Guide
Sea Thrift is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, mimicking its native exposed coastal and mountainous environments. Once established, it requires minimal watering and infrequent fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for rock gardens or coastal landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. Native habitats typically feature lean, nutrient-poor soils. Excessive fertilization can lead to lush foliage at the expense of fewer flowers and leggy growth.
