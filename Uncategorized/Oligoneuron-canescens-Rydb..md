## Care Guide
This prairie native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring conditions that mimic its open, exposed habitat. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering and tolerating periods of dryness. Fertilization is generally not essential, as it adapted to average prairie soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average soil and does not typically require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring is optional but often unnecessary.
