## Care Guide
This circumboreal moss thrives in consistently wet, mineral-rich environments typical of fens and wetlands. Provide partial to full sun exposure and ensure its substrate remains perpetually moist. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to low-nutrient or moderately mineralized conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. Does not require heavy fertilization. Benefits from mineral-rich water, typical of calcareous fens, but avoids high nutrient loads.
