## Introduction
Dyssodia is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Many species formerly included in Dyssodia are now treated as members of other related genera, including Thymophylla or Adenophyllum. Dyssodia papposa is usually retained in this genus.  The name is derived from the Greek δυσοδια (dusodia), meaning "ill-smelling".
Several species of Dyssodia (sensu lato) have found their way into the nursery trade and are relatively popular flowering annuals for hot, dry sites.  Generally sold as threadleaf dyssodia (Dyssodia tenuisecta) and golden dyssodia (Dyssodia cf. pentachaeta).  They perform best in well-drained soil.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native dry subtropical grasslands. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and provide light fertilizer during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer). Prefers lean to moderately fertile soils.
