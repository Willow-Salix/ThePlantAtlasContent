## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern North America, specifically Labrador, Canada, and other subarctic/boreal regions |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest / Subarctic (wetlands, riparian zones) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, as it grows in open, moist areas. |
| **Watering** | High; soil should be kept consistently moist to wet, mimicking its native habitat along water bodies and in ditches. |

## Introduction
The docks and sorrels, genus Rumex, are a genus of about 200 species of annual, biennial, and perennial herbs in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae.
Members of this genus are very common perennial herbs with a native almost worldwide distribution, and introduced species growing in the few places where the genus is not native.
Some are nuisance weeds (and are sometimes called dockweed or dock weed), but some are grown for their edible leaves. Rumex species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species, and are the only host plants of Lycaena dispar and Lycaena rubidus.

## Care Guide
This hardy subarctic dock thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native riparian or wetland environments. It prefers full sun to partial shade and generally does not require heavy fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; this plant is adaptable and can thrive in average soils without heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if soil is poor.
