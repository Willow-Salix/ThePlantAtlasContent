## 🌱 Overview
Alopecurus, or foxtail grass, is a common and widespread genus of plants in the grass family. It is common across temperate and subtropical parts of Eurasia, northern Africa, and the Americas, as well as naturalized in Australia and on various islands.
Foxtails can be annual or perennial. They grow in tufts. They have flat leaves and blunt ligules (a small flap at the junction of leaf and stem). Their inflorescence is a dense panicle (a branching head without terminal flower) with 1-flowered spikelets. A few, particularly A. myosuroides, are considered weeds, others are very decorative and are used in bouquets of dried flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cretan Meadow Foxtail thrives in full sun with moderate watering, particularly during its active growth. It tolerates drier conditions in summer and adapts well to average soil fertility. Minimal fertilization is required for this resilient Mediterranean grass.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. As a wild grass, it's adapted to average soil fertility and does not require rich soil. An annual light application of balanced fertilizer is generally sufficient.
