## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida, Georgia, South Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Grassland/Savanna (pine flatwoods, sandhills, open woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight for best growth) |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the topsoil to dry out between waterings. Tolerant of drought once established, but performs best with consistent moisture in well-drained soil. |

## Introduction
Muhlenbergia is a genus of plants in the grass family.
The genus is named in honor of the German-American amateur botanist Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg (1753-1815). Many of the species are known by the common name muhly.
The greatest number are native to the southwestern United States and Mexico, but there are also native species in Canada, Central and South America and in Asia.

## Care Guide
Gulfhairawn Muhly thrives in full sun to partial shade within a subtropical environment. It requires moderate watering, preferring well-drained soil and tolerating some drought once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to leaner native soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or it may not be necessary in naturally fertile soils.
