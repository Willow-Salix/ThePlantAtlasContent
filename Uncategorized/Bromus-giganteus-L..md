## Introduction
Bromus is a large genus of grasses, classified in its own tribe Bromeae. They are commonly known as bromes, brome grasses, cheat grasses, or chess grasses. Estimates in the scientific literature of the number of species have ranged from 100 to 400, but plant taxonomists currently recognize around 160–170 species.
Bromus is part of the cool-season grass lineage (subfamily Pooideae), which includes about 3300 species.  Within Pooideae, Bromus is classified in tribe Bromeae (it is the only genus in the tribe).  Bromus is closely related to the wheat-grass lineage (tribe Triticeae) that includes such economically important genera as Triticum (wheat), Hordeum (barley) and Secale (rye).

## Care Guide
Tall Brome thrives in conditions mimicking its temperate woodland origins, requiring partial to full shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide ample organic matter to support its moderate nutrient needs and protect it from intense, direct sunlight for best growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, prefers soil rich in organic matter, consistent with leaf litter decomposition in its native woodland habitat.
