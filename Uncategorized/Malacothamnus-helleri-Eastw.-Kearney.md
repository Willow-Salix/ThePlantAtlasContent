## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (specifically the Channel Islands) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland / Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure to thrive, typical of its open, scrubland native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Prefers moderate watering during its active growth period (cooler months); once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and needs minimal to no water during hot, dry summers. |

## Introduction
Malacothamnus (bushmallow) is a genus of shrubs found throughout much of mainland California and on three of the Channel Islands. Outside of California, Malacothamnus is known from the northern half of Baja California and from a few disjunct locations in Arizona and Nevada. Plants of this genus are most commonly found in early-successional, post-burn plant communities. Malacothamnus are currently thought to be most closely related to the Iliamnas of the US interior and the Phymosias of Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun with well-draining soil, reflecting its Mediterranean scrubland origins. Water regularly during establishment and the cooler growing season, but drastically reduce or cease watering in summer due to its excellent drought tolerance. Fertilize sparingly, as it is adapted to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs; it is adapted to poorer, rocky or sandy soils common in its native habitat, so over-fertilization should be avoided.
