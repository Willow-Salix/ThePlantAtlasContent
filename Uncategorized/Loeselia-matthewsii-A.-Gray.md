## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, reflecting its native arid desert climate. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid over-fertilizing to best mimic its natural growing conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low; fertilize sparingly, if at all, as it thrives in nutrient-poor desert soils.
