## 🧤 Care Instructions
This endangered milkvetch thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, characteristic of its arid native habitat in California's high desert. Provide lean, well-drained, alkaline soil and avoid heavy fertilization, as it naturally fixes nitrogen and is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is needed. This plant thrives in lean, well-drained, often alkaline soils and, as a legume, fixes its own nitrogen.
