## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Creeping Tonguefern, mimic its native tropical rainforest environment by providing low to indirect bright light and maintaining consistently moist, well-draining substrate. High humidity is essential for its health, and it benefits from light, infrequent fertilization during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the growing season with a dilute liquid fertilizer (e.g., half-strength). As an epiphyte, it does not require heavy feeding.
