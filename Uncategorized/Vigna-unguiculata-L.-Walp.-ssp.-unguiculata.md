## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | West Africa (Sahel region, savannas) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Savanna/Semi-Arid Tropical |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day), as it originates from open savanna environments with minimal canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings. Thrives in environments with distinct wet and dry seasons, indicating good drought tolerance but also benefits from consistent moisture during active growth, avoiding waterlogging. |

## Introduction
The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is an annual herbaceous legume from the genus Vigna. It can be erect, semierect (trailing), or climbing. A high level of morphological diversity is found within the species with large variations in the size, shape, and structure of the plant. Four subspecies are recognised, three of which are cultivated.
Its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall have made it an important crop in the semiarid regions across Africa and Asia. It was domesticated in Africa and is one of the oldest crops to be farmed. A second domestication event probably occurred in Asia, before they spread into Europe and the Americas.
Most cowpeas are grown on the African continent, particularly in Nigeria and Niger, which account for 66% of world production. A 1997 estimate suggests that cowpeas are cultivated on 12.5 millionhectares (31 millionacres) of land, have a worldwide production of 3 million tonnes and are consumed by 200 million people on a daily basis. Insect infestation is a major constraint to the production of cowpea, sometimes causing over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer Maruca vitrata is the main preharvest pest of the cowpea and the cowpea weevil Callosobruchus maculatus the main postharvest pest. It requires very few inputs, as the plant's root nodules are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable crop for resource-poor farmers and well-suited to intercropping with other crops.
The crop is mainly grown for its seeds, which are high in protein, although the leaves and immature seed pods can also be consumed. The seeds are usually cooked and made into stews and curries, or ground into flour or paste. The whole plant is also used as forage for animals, with its use as cattle feed likely responsible for its name.

## Care Guide
Southern Pea thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its savanna origins. It's drought-tolerant but benefits from consistent moisture during its growing season, particularly during flowering and pod development. As a legume, it requires minimal nitrogen fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low nitrogen fertilizer is needed due to its nitrogen-fixing ability as a legume. Moderate phosphorus and potassium may be beneficial, especially in poor soils, but it's generally adapted to less fertile conditions.
