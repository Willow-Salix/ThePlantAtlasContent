## Introduction
Dasistoma macrophylla, commonly known as mullein foxglove, is a species of flowering plant in the broomrape family. It is monotypic, with no other species in the genus Dasistoma.
Dasistoma is native to the eastern United States, where its range is almost exclusively west of the Appalachian Mountains. Its natural habitat is in dry or dry-mesic woodlands and bluffs, typically on calcareous substrates. It is a moderately conservative species, not being found in highly ecologically disturbed habitats.
Dasistoma is a tall hemiparasitic forb growing to around six feet high. It is short lived, typically an annual or biennial although occasionally perennial. It produces tubular yellow flowers in the summer.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, mirroring its native central U.S. prairies and open woodlands. It requires moderate watering during establishment but becomes drought-tolerant once mature, needing minimal additional moisture. Fertilizer needs are low, as it is adapted to lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to lean, average, or rocky soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization. Over-fertilizing can be detrimental.
