| **Native Origin** | Southern California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland and Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and abundant flowering. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires very little to no supplemental water during its natural dry summer period. |

## Introduction
Linum (flax) is a genus of approximately 200 species in the flowering plant family Linaceae. They are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the world. The genus includes the common flax (L. usitatissimum), the bast fibre of which is used to produce linen and the seeds to produce linseed oil.

The flowers of most species are blue or yellow, rarely red, white, or pink, and some are heterostylous. There is an average of 6 to 10 seeds per boll.
Linum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the cabbage moth, the nutmeg, the setaceous Hebrew character and Coleophora striolatella, which feeds exclusively on Linum narbonense.

## Care Guide
Cleveland's Flax thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean scrubland habitat. It is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent, deep watering, along with minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. This plant is adapted to poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, if needed, is sufficient.
