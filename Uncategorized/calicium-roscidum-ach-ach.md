## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of Europe, North America, and Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers partial shade to bright indirect light; direct intense sun can be detrimental, especially in low humidity, as it typically grows on shaded wood or rocks within forest understories. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and occasional moisture from rain or mist; does not tolerate dry air or prolonged standing water, as it absorbs water directly from the environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Calicium is a genus of leprose lichens. It is in the family Caliciaceae, and has 40 species.
The sexual reproduction structures are a mass of loose ascospores that are enclosed by a cup shaped exciple sitting on top of a tiny stalk, having the appearance of a dressmaker's pin (called a mazaedium), hence the common name pin lichen. They are also commonly called stubble lichens.
They have been used as indicator species for old growth redwood forests.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, often found on decaying wood or mossy rocks. Ensure high atmospheric moisture through consistent humidity or regular misting, as it relies on ambient moisture. Avoid direct, intense sunlight and dry conditions, and no additional fertilization is required.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed; obtains all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (e.g., dust, pollutants) and minerals present in its substrate (e.g., bark, wood, rock).
