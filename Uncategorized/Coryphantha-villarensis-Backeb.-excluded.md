## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico (Oaxaca, Puebla) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun to bright indirect light, mimicking its natural habitat in exposed arid regions. |
| **Watering** | Water thoroughly but infrequently during the spring and summer growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly or cease entirely in fall and winter during dormancy. |

## Introduction
Coryphantha (from Greek, "flowering on the top"), or beehive cactus, is a genus of small to middle-sized, globose or columnar cacti. The genus is native to arid parts of Central America, Mexico, through Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas and north into southwestern, central, and southeastern Montana. With its two subgenera, 57 species and 20 subspecies, it is one of the largest genera of cactus.

## Care Guide
This cactus, often considered a synonym of Coryphantha ramillosa, thrives in conditions mimicking its arid Mexican origins, requiring abundant sunlight and very well-draining soil. Water sparingly during its growing period and keep it dry in winter to prevent rot, ensuring minimal fertilization for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Apply a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer). Avoid fertilizing during dormancy.
