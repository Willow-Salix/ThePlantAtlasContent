## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils. Mimic its native arid environment by providing infrequent, deep watering and avoiding excessive fertilization. It's an excellent choice for xeriscaping or rock gardens in dry climates.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; it thrives in lean, well-draining soils typical of its native habitat, which are generally nutrient-poor.
