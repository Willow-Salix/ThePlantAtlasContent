## Introduction
Heteranthera is a genus of aquatic plants in the water hyacinth family, Pontederiaceae, known generally as mud plantains. Species of this genus are native to tropical and subtropical America and Africa. They live in the water or in wet soils. They produce leaves on long petioles and some are cultivated for their attractive flowers. Leaves are of two types - linear and submerged or orbicular and floating. Some species have cleistogamic flowers.

## Care Guide
This aquatic plant thrives in tropical and subtropical wetland conditions. It requires consistent high to moderate light and must be kept constantly wet or fully submersed in water. Provide a nutrient-rich environment, either through the water column or substrate, to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high nutrient availability, benefiting from nutrients in the water column or a rich aquatic substrate
