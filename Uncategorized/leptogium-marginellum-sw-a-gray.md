## 🌱 Overview
Leptogium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Collemataceae. It has about 110 species. Species formerly classified under Leptogium have since been divided among the genera Leptogium, Pseudoleptogium, and Scytinium. Leptogium lichens are predominantly found on tree bark or soil, often among mosses, and sometimes on rocks in moist environments.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Skin Lichen thrives in environments with consistently high humidity and low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native tropical forest habitat. Ensure constant moisture through regular misting or a humid enclosure, and avoid direct sun and excessive fertilization to maintain its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
