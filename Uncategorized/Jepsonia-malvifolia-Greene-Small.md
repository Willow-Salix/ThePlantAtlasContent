## Care Guide
Island Jepsonia thrives in well-draining soil under full sun to partial shade, mimicking its Mediterranean island origins. Water consistently during its active fall to spring growth, then reduce or stop watering completely as it enters summer dormancy. Avoid heavy fertilization to maintain its natural vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in fall or early spring during active growth is sufficient, if desired.
