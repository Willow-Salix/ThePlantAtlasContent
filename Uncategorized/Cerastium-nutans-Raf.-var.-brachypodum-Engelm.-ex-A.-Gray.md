## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest and Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Sun to Full Sun. Thrives in bright, indirect light or morning sun in warmer climates, tolerating full sun if soil moisture is consistently maintained. |
| **Watering** | Consistently Moist Soil. Requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, as its native habitats are typically moist places like stream banks and woodlands. |

## Introduction
Cerastium is a genus of annual, winter annual, or perennial flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. They are commonly called mouse-ears or mouse-ear chickweeds. There are 214 accepted species, found nearly worldwide but with the greatest concentration in the northern temperate regions. A number of the species are common weeds in fields and on disturbed ground.

Cerastium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora chalcogrammella (which feeds exclusively on Cerastium arvense) and Coleophora striatipennella (which has been recorded on Cerastium fontanum).

## Care Guide
Nodding Chickweed is adapted to temperate conditions, preferring consistently moist soil and tolerating a range from partial sun to full sun. It has modest nutrient requirements, typically thriving with the addition of organic matter to the soil. Ensure regular watering to mimic its native moist environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Benefits from light application of organic matter or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season, consistent with its growth in natural, moderately fertile soils.
