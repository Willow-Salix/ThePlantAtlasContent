## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of South America (e.g., Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela) and Central America. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest and Savannahs, characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons with warm temperatures year-round. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, ideally receiving at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight, mirroring its exposure in open native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during active growth (wet season), allowing the topsoil to dry completely between applications; significantly reduced watering during dry seasons or dormancy. |

## Introduction
Tephrosia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is widespread in both the Eastern and Western Hemisphere, where it is found in tropical and warm-temperate regions.
The generic name is derived from the Greek word τεφρος (tephros), meaning "ash-colored," referring to the greyish tint given to the leaves by their dense trichomes. Hoarypea is a common name for plants in this genus, along with goat's rue and devil's shoestring.

## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun and well-drained soil, this tropical legume requires moderate watering during its active growth period, with reduced frequency during drier seasons. As a nitrogen-fixer, it has low fertilizer demands, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant well-suited to its native open, seasonal environments.

### Fertilizer
Low, especially for nitrogen, as it is a legume and fixes atmospheric nitrogen. A balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season if soil appears deficient.
