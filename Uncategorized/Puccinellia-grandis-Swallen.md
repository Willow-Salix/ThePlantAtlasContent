## Care Guide
Puccinellia grandis thrives in consistently wet conditions with full to partial sun exposure. Ensure its soil remains moist and provide low to moderate fertilization. This plant is well-suited for water features or bog gardens that mimic its native wetland habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to natural wetland soils which can vary in nutrient content but are not typically extremely rich. Over-fertilization may be detrimental.
