## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Smoothstem Sedge thrives in cool, shady, and consistently wet environments, mimicking its native wetland understory habitat. Ensure high humidity and never let the soil dry out, and fertilize lightly during the active growing period.
