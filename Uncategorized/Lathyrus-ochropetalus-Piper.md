## Care Guide
This temperate montane plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Avoid waterlogging, especially in winter. It requires light fertilization, benefiting from a balanced approach rather than high nitrogen, due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen is not needed. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring if soil is poor.
