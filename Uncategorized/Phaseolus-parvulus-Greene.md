| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico) and Northern Mexico (Chihuahua, Sonora) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Woodland/Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade, thriving in open, sunny clearings within its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out between waterings, mimicking seasonal rainfall patterns found in montane regions. Well-drained soil is essential. |

## Introduction
Phaseolus (bean, wild bean) is a genus of herbaceous to woody annual and perennial vines in the family Fabaceae containing about 70 plant species, all native to the Americas, primarily Mesoamerica.
It is one of the most economically important legume genera. Five of the species have been domesticated since pre-Columbian times for their beans: P. acutifolius (tepary bean), P. coccineus (runner bean), P. dumosus (year bean), P. lunatus (lima bean), and P. vulgaris (common bean). Most prominent among these is the common bean, P. vulgaris, which today is cultivated worldwide in tropical, semitropical, and temperate climates.

## Care Guide
Provide ample sunlight and ensure well-drained soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and use a low-nitrogen fertilizer sparingly as beans are nitrogen fixers. Protect from extreme cold if grown outside its native temperate montane range.

### Fertilizer
As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and generally has low to moderate fertilizer needs. A balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer or compost can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
