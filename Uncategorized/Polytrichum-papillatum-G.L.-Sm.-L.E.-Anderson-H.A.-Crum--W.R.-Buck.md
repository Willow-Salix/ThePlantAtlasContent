## Introduction
Polytrichum is a genus of mosses — commonly called haircap moss or hair moss — which contains approximately 70 species that have a cosmopolitan distribution.
The genus Polytrichum has a number of closely related sporophytic characters. The scientific name is derived from the Ancient Greek words polys, meaning "many", and thrix, meaning "hair". This name was used in ancient times to refer to plants with fine, hairlike parts, including mosses, but this application specifically refers to the hairy calyptras found on young sporophytes. A similar naming related to hair appears in Old Norse, haddr silfjar, "hair of Sif", goddess from Norse Mythology, wife of the god Thor. There are two major sections of Polytrichum species. The first — section Polytrichum — has narrow, toothed, and relatively erect leaf margins. The other — section Juniperifolia — has broad, entire,  and sharply inflexed leaf margins that enclose the lamellae on the upper leaf surface.

## Care Guide
To care for Papilla Polytrichum Moss, maintain a constantly wet environment with high humidity, typical of its native bog or damp forest habitats. Provide partial shade or indirect light and avoid any direct sun exposure. Fertilization is generally not required for this moss species.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is needed; mosses thrive in nutrient-poor environments, especially in bogs.
