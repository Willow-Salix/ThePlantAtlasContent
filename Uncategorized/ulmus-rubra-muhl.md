## 🧤 Care Instructions
Slippery Elm thrives in temperate environments, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, rich, well-drained soil. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, and provide moderate fertilization if the soil is not naturally fertile to encourage healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization, especially in less fertile soils, as it naturally prefers rich, well-drained loamy soils. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can support robust growth.
