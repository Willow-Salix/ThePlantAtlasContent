## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal ranges and foothills of California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Woodland and Shrubland (Chaparral) |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade; needs good light exposure for abundant flowering, especially in cooler climates or coastal fog. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering during its active growing season (fall to spring). It is drought-tolerant during its summer dormancy and needs significantly reduced or no water during this period with excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Iris fernaldii, commonly known as Fernald's iris, is a species of iris endemic to western Northern California.
It is native to the Inner and Outer North California Coast Ranges, such as the Santa Cruz Mountains, and surrounding the San Francisco Bay Area. It is found between 164–6,562 feet (50–2,000 m) in elevation. It grows in full sun near the coast, and afternoon shade inland.
Fernald's are no longer found in pure form in Marin County, however; they have naturally hybridized with Iris douglasiana in this area.

## Care Guide
Fernald's Iris thrives in conditions mimicking its native Californian Mediterranean climate, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering during its active growth from fall to spring, followed by a dry dormancy period in summer with excellent drainage. Fertilization should be minimal, supporting its adaptation to leaner soils.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in lean, well-draining soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in early spring, if desired, is sufficient.
