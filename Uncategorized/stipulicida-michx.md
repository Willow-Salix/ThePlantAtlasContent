## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stipulicida thrives in bright, open conditions with very well-draining sandy soil. Provide moderate water, ensuring the soil dries completely between sessions, and use minimal fertilizer as it's naturally adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to light fertilization; adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the growing season if desired, but is often not strictly necessary.
