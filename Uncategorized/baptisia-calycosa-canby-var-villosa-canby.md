## 🌱 Overview
Baptisia (wild indigo, false indigo) is a genus in the legume family, Fabaceae. They are flowering herbaceous perennial plants with pea-like flowers, followed by pods, which are sometimes inflated. They are native to woodland and grassland in eastern and southern North America. The species most commonly found in cultivation is B. australis.
Baptisia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the jaguar flower moth, Schinia jaguarina.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Florida native thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its natural habitat in open woodlands and pine flatwoods. Once established, it is relatively drought-tolerant, requiring moderate watering and minimal fertilization, especially avoiding excessive nitrogen due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, avoiding high-nitrogen fertilizers due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume. An annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer can be beneficial.
