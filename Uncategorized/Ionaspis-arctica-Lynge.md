## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and alpine regions, including Greenland, Svalbard, Northern Europe (e.g., Norway, Sweden, Finland), Russia, Alaska, and Northern Canada. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High, direct exposure to sunlight, tolerant of strong UV radiation due to its exposed habitat on rocks and barren ground. |
| **Watering** | Relies on atmospheric moisture (rain, snowmelt, fog) for hydration; tolerates periods of desiccation followed by periods of saturation. |

## Introduction
Ionaspis is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Hymeneliaceae. It contains six species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), crustose lichens. The genus was originally circumscribed in 1871 by Theodor Magnus Fries. He segregated the genus from Aspicilia based on the presence of Trentepohlia rather than Trebouxia as the photobiont partner.

## Care Guide
This crustose lichen, native to arctic and alpine tundras, thrives in cold, exposed environments. It requires high light exposure and obtains moisture and nutrients primarily from the atmosphere, tolerating periods of desiccation. Minimal 'care' in a traditional sense is needed, as it is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient requirements; obtains necessary minerals from the atmosphere and substrate; no specific fertilization needed.
