# Crocynia Lichen
### *Crocynia (Ach.) A. Massal.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in humid temperate and tropical regions globally, including forests in North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest), Europe, East Asia, and parts of South America and Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate Forests to Tropical Rainforests |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate indirect light; thrives in shaded conditions, avoiding direct sunlight which can cause desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires very high, consistent humidity. Frequent misting or placement in a closed terrarium/humid environment is essential to prevent drying out. Does not require traditional soil watering as it absorbs moisture directly from the air. |

## 🌱 Overview
Crocynia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. It has five species. The genus is currently in taxonomic limbo because molecular studies have shown that Crocynia, which has nomenclatural priority over Phyllopsora, is phylogenetically nested within Phyllopsora. This has led to a proposal to conserve the name Phyllopsora over Crocynia to ensure nomenclatural stability and avoid taxonomic disarray.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Crocynia lichens demand consistently high humidity and low to moderate indirect light. Maintaining a moist environment through frequent misting or terrarium conditions is crucial for survival. Avoid any fertilization, as these organisms are highly sensitive to added nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens are highly sensitive to excess nutrients and pollutants; fertilization is not recommended and can be detrimental to their health.
