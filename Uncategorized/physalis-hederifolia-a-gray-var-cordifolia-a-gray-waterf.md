## 🌱 Overview
Physalis (, , , , from Ancient Greek: φυσαλλίς phusallís 'bladder') is a genus of approximately 75 to 90 flowering plants in the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which are native to the Americas and Australasia. At least 46 species are endemic to Mexico. Cultivated and weedy species have been introduced worldwide. A defining feature of Physalis is a large, papery husk derived from the calyx, which partly or fully encloses the fruit. Many species bear edible fruit, and some species are cultivated.
The typical Physalis fruit is similar to a firm tomato in texture, and like a sweet, tangy grape in flavor. Some species, such as the Cape gooseberry and tomatillo, have been bred into many cultivars with varying flavors, from tart to sweet to savory. Nations including Colombia, India, and Mexico have a significant economic trade in Physalis fruit. The fruits of many species are generically referred to as physalis, groundcherries, husk tomatoes, husk cherries, poha berries, and golden berries.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant is well-suited to arid conditions, requiring full sun and minimal water once established. It prefers lean, well-draining soil and does not need frequent fertilization. Mimicking its native semi-desert environment will ensure healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in poor to average soils; excessive fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental. Fertilize lightly once in spring if growth appears stunted.
