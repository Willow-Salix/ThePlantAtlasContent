## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Northern California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Woodlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for optimal growth and flowering, mimicking its native open habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Low water needs. Water regularly during its active growing season (spring), allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, accustomed to dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Frosted Indian Paintbrush thrives in environments mimicking its native California chaparral, requiring full sun and well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant once established and performs best with minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Avoid rich soils or excessive fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, well-draining soils, often serpentine.
