## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Scandinavia, Greenland, Arctic Canada, and Alaska. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Alpine Tundra. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers open, exposed locations on rocks or in tundra environments, tolerant of high light exposure but also thrives in indirect light conditions common in its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Obtains moisture directly from precipitation (rain, snowmelt) and atmospheric humidity (fog, dew). It requires periods of wetness interspersed with dry periods and is highly tolerant of desiccation; not a traditional 'watering' plant. |

## Introduction
Aspicilia (sunken disk lichen) is a genus of mostly crustose areolate lichens that grow on rock. Most members have black apothecia discs that are slightly immersed in the areolas, hence the common name"Given the same reason, the  naming of Aspicilia is derived from the Greek word for "shield concave". 
Most of the species of this genus grow on calcareous and acidic rocks and most of the taxa prefer temperate and arctic habitats.
Some members of the genus Aspicilia are pioneer species on granite and other hard rock, after which members of other lichen species may grow on them, such as members of Acarospora.

## Care Guide
Aspicilia mazarina is an arctic-alpine lichen thriving on exposed siliceous rocks. It requires high atmospheric humidity and intermittent moisture from precipitation, alongside periods of dryness, and does not need traditional watering or fertilization. It is generally not cultivated as a typical houseplant.

### Fertilizer
Gains all necessary nutrients from the air and its substrate (e.g., siliceous rocks); traditional fertilization is neither required nor beneficial.
