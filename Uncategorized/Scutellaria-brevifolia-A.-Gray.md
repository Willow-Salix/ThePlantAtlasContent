## Introduction
Scutellaria is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. They are known commonly as skullcaps. The generic name is derived from the Latin scutella, meaning "a small dish, tray or platter", or "little dish", referring to the shape of the calyx. The common name alludes to the resemblance of the same structure to "miniature medieval helmets". The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution, with species occurring nearly worldwide, mainly in temperate regions.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in sunny locations with excellent drainage, mirroring its native rocky habitats. Water moderately, ensuring the soil dries completely between applications, and avoid over-fertilization to maintain its natural vigor and compact form.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced feed once in spring is sufficient if desired.
