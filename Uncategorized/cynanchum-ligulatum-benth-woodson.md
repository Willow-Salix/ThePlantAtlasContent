## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers high light exposure, typical of open scrublands or the less dense canopy of dry forests. |
| **💧 Water** | Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during dormant periods. Water thoroughly when actively growing, mimicking its native wet season, then reduce significantly. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cynanchum is a genus of about 300 species including some swallowworts, belonging to the family Apocynaceae. The taxon name comes from Greek kynos (meaning "dog") and anchein ("to choke"), hence the common name for several species is dog-strangling vine. Most species are non-succulent climbers or twiners. There is some evidence of toxicity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mexican Swallow-Wort thrives in conditions similar to its native tropical dry forest, requiring plenty of sun and a distinct wet-dry watering cycle. It needs well-draining soil and benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growth period. This plant is adapted to drought and should not be overwatered.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during its active growing season (spring and summer), typically once every 2-4 weeks. Reduce or cease fertilization during fall and winter.
