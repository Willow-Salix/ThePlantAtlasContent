## Care Guide
This hardy, drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, potentially alkaline soils. It requires infrequent watering and minimal fertilization, making it suitable for low-maintenance, dry, and sunny environments.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; naturally adapted to nutrient-poor and often saline or alkaline soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, during its active growth period.
