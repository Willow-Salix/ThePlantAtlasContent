## Introduction
Micranthes hieraciifolia (common names: hawkweed-leaved saxifrage, hawkweed-leaf saxifrage, stiff stem saxifrage or stiff-stemmed saxifrage) is a species of flowering plants. It is native to Europe, North America and temperate Asia, being distributed throughout the high Arctic and some alpine areas like Norway and the Carpathian Mountains, with a few isolated populations in the Central Eastern Alps of Austria and the Massif Central of France. It is generally uncommon.
It grows to a height of 10–20 cm. The leaves are oblong to rhombic, thick, and remotely toothed. The stem is single, stout and thick, and densely glandular. The flowers are produced in dense clusters, small and inconspicuous, with greenish to purplish petals.
It grows in meadows, on solifluction soil, and in places with well-developed moss.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in cool, well-drained conditions, mimicking its native rocky slopes. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure consistent moisture during the growing season without waterlogging. Minimal fertilization is generally sufficient for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; prefers lean, well-drained soils and does not require heavy fertilization.
