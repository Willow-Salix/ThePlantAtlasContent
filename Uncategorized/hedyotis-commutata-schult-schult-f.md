## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical plant thrives in warm, humid conditions with consistently moist soil, reflecting its origins in monsoon regions. It is quite adaptable to light, tolerating full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile groundcover or garden plant. Provide regular watering and minimal fertilizer to best emulate its natural environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; a balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season, as it thrives in relatively unamended soils.
