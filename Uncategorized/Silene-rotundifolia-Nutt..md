## Care Guide
This native wildflower thrives in conditions mimicking its Appalachian home, preferring full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and apply minimal to low fertilizer to support its natural vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in the spring, or fertilization may be minimal if grown in naturally rich soil.
