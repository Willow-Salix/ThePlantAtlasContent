## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean (e.g., Cuba), and parts of South America (e.g., Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Humid Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun is ideal; avoid harsh, direct midday sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Frequent watering is necessary; mist 2-3 times per week, or soak in water for 20-30 minutes once a week. Ensure the plant dries completely within a few hours to prevent rot. |

## Introduction
Tillandsia is a genus of around 650 species of evergreen, perennial flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae, native to the forests, mountains and deserts of the Neotropics, from northern Mexico and the southeastern United States to Mesoamerica and the Caribbean to central Argentina. Their leaves, more or less silvery in color, are covered with specialized cells (trichomes) capable of rapidly absorbing water that gathers on them.
They are also commonly known as air plants because they obtain nutrients and water from the air, not needing soil for nourishment. They have a natural propensity to cling to whatever surfaces are readily available: telephone wires, tree branches, bark, bare rocks, etc. Their light seeds and a silky parachute facilitate their spread.  Most Tillandsia species are epiphytes – which translates to 'upon a plant'. Some are aerophytes, which have a minimal root system and grow on shifting desert soil. Due to their epiphytic way of life, these plants will not grow in soil but live on the branches of trees, in deserts and on other substrates that will not be saturated with water for very long.

## Care Guide
The Narrowleaf Airplant thrives in bright, indirect light, mimicking its natural canopy habitat. It requires frequent watering through misting or soaking, but proper air circulation is crucial to allow it to dry completely after watering, preventing rot. As an epiphyte, it benefits from infrequent, diluted fertilization during its active growing season.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is needed; use a highly diluted (1/4 strength) air plant specific fertilizer once a month during spring and summer.
