## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bingen Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soil, mirroring its native Columbia River Gorge shrubland habitat. It requires moderate watering in spring, tolerating dry conditions and reduced watering in summer once established. Avoid nitrogen-rich fertilizers due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen; avoid nitrogen-rich fertilizers. Prefers lean, well-draining soil.
