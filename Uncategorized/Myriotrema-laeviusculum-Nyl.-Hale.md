## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions, including Southeast Asia (e.g., Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka) and parts of the Americas. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Very low to indirect light; requires significant shade, mimicking the dense forest understory where it grows on tree bark. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is crucial. Requires consistent moisture, often through frequent misting or a constantly damp (but not waterlogged) substrate; sensitive to dry air. |

## Care Guide
This tropical rainforest lichen thrives in environments with very high humidity and extremely low, indirect light, mimicking its natural understory habitat. Avoid traditional fertilizers as they are detrimental, focusing instead on consistent moisture and clean air for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required or recommended. Lichens are highly sensitive to nutrient build-up and environmental pollutants.
