## Introduction
Ceanothus is a genus of about 50–60 species of nitrogen-fixing shrubs and small trees in the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae). Common names for members of this genus are buckbrush, California lilac, soap bush, or just ceanothus. "Ceanothus" comes from Ancient Greek: κεάνωθος (keánōthos), which was applied by Theophrastus (371–287 BC) to an Old World plant believed to be Cirsium arvense.
The genus is native to North America with the highest diversity on the western coast. Some species (e.g., C. americanus) are restricted to the eastern United States and southeast Canada, and others (e.g., C. caeruleus) extend as far south as Guatemala. Most are shrubs 0.5–3 metres (1.6–9.8 ft) tall, but C. arboreus and C. thyrsiflorus, both native to California, can be small multi-trunked trees up to 6–7 metres (20–23 ft) tall.

## Care Guide
Whitethorn Ceanothus prefers full sun and is exceptionally drought-tolerant once mature, requiring minimal watering. Avoid over-fertilization, particularly with nitrogen, as it naturally fixes its own and is adapted to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
None to very low. As a nitrogen-fixing plant, it thrives in nutrient-poor soils and does not require supplementary nitrogen.
