## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native Southern California Mediterranean climate. Provide full sun and ensure well-draining soil to prevent rot. Water during the cooler, active growing season (fall to spring), and allow it to experience a dry, dormant period through the hot summer.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial, but generally thrives in nutrient-poor soils and does not require heavy feeding.
