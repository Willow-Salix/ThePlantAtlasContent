## Care Guide
Cereus Trigonus thrives in environments that replicate its native Caribbean habitat, requiring abundant direct sunlight and well-draining soil. Water thoroughly during warmer months only when the soil is completely dry, and keep it nearly dry during cooler, dormant periods to prevent root rot. Provide light, infrequent fertilization during its active growth phase.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization with a balanced, diluted cactus fertilizer applied sparingly during the active growing season.
