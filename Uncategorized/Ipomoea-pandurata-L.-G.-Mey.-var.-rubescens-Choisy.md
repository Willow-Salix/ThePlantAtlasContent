## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central United States |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland/Grassland Edges |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun, but can tolerate partial shade, especially in hotter climates. Requires at least 6 hours of direct sun for best flowering. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular watering, especially when young, but is drought-tolerant once established due to its tuberous root. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. |

## Introduction
Ipomoea pandurata, known as man of the earth, wild potato vine, manroot, wild sweet potato, is a species of herbaceous perennial vine native to North America. It is a twining plant of woodland verges and rough places with heart-shaped leaves and funnel-shaped white flowers with a pinkish throat. The large tuberous roots can be roasted and eaten, or can be used to make a poultice or infusion. When uncooked, the roots have purgative properties.

## Care Guide
The Wild Potato Vine thrives in full sun to partial shade in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soil. It needs regular watering when young but becomes drought-tolerant once established, owing to its large tuberous root system. Minimal fertilization is usually sufficient, making it a relatively low-maintenance, vigorous vine.

### Fertilizer
Adaptable to average soil fertility; does not typically require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can encourage vigorous growth.
