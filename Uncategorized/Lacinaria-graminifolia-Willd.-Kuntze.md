| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland/Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours direct sunlight daily) for optimal flowering; tolerates light partial shade but may result in fewer blooms. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out somewhat between sessions. Drought-tolerant once established, but prefers consistent moisture during its active growing season. |

## Introduction
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## Care Guide
This perennial flourishes in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native temperate woodland and grassland habitats. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and has low fertilizer needs. It's a robust, low-maintenance plant once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor soils and typically does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or organic compost in spring is sufficient if the soil is very poor.
