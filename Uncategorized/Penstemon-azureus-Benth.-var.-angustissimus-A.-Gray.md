| **Native Origin** | California, USA (primarily Sierra Nevada foothills and Coast Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Foothill Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its natural habitat in open, unshaded areas. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate water. Drought-tolerant once established, preferring drier conditions in summer. Requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot, especially during cooler, wetter periods. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean chaparral and foothill environment. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal watering and fertilization. Avoid overwatering and rich soils to ensure healthy growth and abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer. Thrives in lean, infertile soils. Rich soils can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering, so fertilization is generally unnecessary.
