*Aspiromitus husnotii (Steph.) Steph.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Riparian Microclimate |
| **Sunlight** | Very low to low, indirect light; prefers deep shade or diffused light, often found submerged or partially submerged under canopy. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant moisture; typically grown partially or fully submerged in clean, cool water. High ambient humidity is critical; intolerant of drying out. |

## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in consistently wet, very humid, and low-light conditions, mimicking its native riparian habitats. It requires constant moisture, often partially submerged, and should be protected from direct sunlight and drying out. Nutrient requirements are minimal.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; sensitive to high nutrient levels and salts. Naturally absorbs nutrients from clean water and substrate.
