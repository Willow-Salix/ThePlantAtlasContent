## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Rocky Mountains of the USA (primarily Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona at higher elevations) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine and Montane zones, characterized by cold snowy winters, mild summers, and moderate precipitation with well-drained, often rocky or sandy soils. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun is ideal for robust growth and flowering, though it can tolerate light partial shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate once established; highly drought-tolerant. Requires excellent drainage and should not be overwatered; prefers deep but infrequent watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Colorado Bearberry is a resilient subalpine plant that thrives in full sun and requires very well-drained, lean soils. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing minimal watering and generally no fertilization, making it a low-maintenance groundcover for suitable arid or rocky landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none; this plant thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils typical of its native habitat. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
