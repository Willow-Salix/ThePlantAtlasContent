## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (USA: California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Oregon, Washington; Mexico: Baja California) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Wetland/Riparian |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade is ideal, especially where it can receive good light without extreme heat. |
| **Watering** | High; the soil should be kept consistently moist to wet, mimicking its native habitat in stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows. Avoid drying out. |

## Introduction
Epilobium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae, containing about 197 species. The genus has a worldwide distribution. It is most prevalent in the subarctic, temperate and subantarctic regions, whereas in the subtropics and tropics Epilobium species are restricted to the cool montane biomes, such as the New Guinea Highlands.
The taxonomy of the genus has varied between different botanists, but the modern trend is to include the previously recognised genera Boisduvalia, Chamaenerion (previously Chamerion), Pyrogennema and Zauschneria within Epilobium according to Peter H. Raven, who has extensively studied the willowherbs and merges the other segregate genera into Epilobium. Fringed willowherb (Epilobium ciliatum) is likely a cryptic species complex; apparently these plants also commonly hybridize with their congeners.
Most species are known by the common name willowherbs for their willow-like leaves. Those that were once separated in Boisduvalia are called spike-primroses or boisduvalias. Those Epilobium species previously placed in the Chamaenerion group are known as fireweeds.

## Care Guide
Parish's Willowherb requires consistently moist to wet soil, reflecting its native habitat in wetlands and along water bodies. It prefers full sun to partial shade conditions. Fertilization should be kept low to moderate, focusing on providing adequate moisture above all else for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season, as overly rich soil is not typical of its native habitat.
