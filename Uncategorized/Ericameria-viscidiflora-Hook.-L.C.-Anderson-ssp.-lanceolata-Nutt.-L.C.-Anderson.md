## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including parts of the Great Basin (e.g., California, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Sagebrush Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day), reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant once established; requires infrequent watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Ericameria is a genus of North American shrubs in the family Asteraceae.
Ericameria is known by the common names goldenbush, rabbitbrush, turpentine bush, and rabbitbush. Most are shrubs, but one species (E. parishii) can reach tree stature. They are distributed in western Canada (Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia) western United States (from the western Great Plains to the Pacific) and northern Mexico. Bright yellow flower heads adorn the plants in late summer. All the species have disc florets, while some have ray florets but others do not. Ericameria nauseosa, (synonym Chrysothamnus nauseosus), is known for its production of latex.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant shrub thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its arid native environment. Once established, it requires minimal watering and has very low fertilizer needs, making it an easy-care plant for dry, sunny landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor, sandy, or rocky soils typical of its native range; does not require regular fertilization. If desired, a very light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring.
