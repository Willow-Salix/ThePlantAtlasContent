## 🧤 Care Instructions
This subalpine plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, consistently moist soil during its active growth. It requires minimal fertilizer, adapting to its native lean soil conditions and hemiparasitic nature. Ensure it has cold hardiness for its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Excessive fertilization should be avoided, especially with nitrogen, as these plants are often adapted to nutrient-poor soils and are hemiparasitic, deriving nutrients from host plants.
