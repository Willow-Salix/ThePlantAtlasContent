## Care Guide
This xerophytic moss thrives in bright, exposed conditions characteristic of its arid native habitat. Provide full sun and allow the substrate to thoroughly dry out between infrequent waterings to prevent rot. It requires very little to no fertilizer, adapting well to lean, mineral-rich soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. This moss is adapted to low-nutrient, often calcareous soils and does not require rich feeding.
