## Care Guide
Leafless Agalinis thrives in full to partial sun with consistently moist soil, mirroring its native habitat in the wet savannas and flatwoods of the southeastern US. It prefers low to moderate fertility due to its hemi-parasitic nature, acquiring nutrients from nearby host plants. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging while maintaining constant moisture.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a hemi-parasite, it extracts nutrients from host plants, so excessive fertilization is generally not needed and could be harmful.
