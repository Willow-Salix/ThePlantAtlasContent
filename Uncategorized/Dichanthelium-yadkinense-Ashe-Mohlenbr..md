## Care Guide
This panicgrass thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native habitat in humid temperate woods and bogs. Fertilizer needs are low to moderate. It is best to maintain regular watering to support its moisture-loving nature.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it's adapted to sandy or peaty soils which can be less nutrient-rich; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be beneficial if soil is very poor.
