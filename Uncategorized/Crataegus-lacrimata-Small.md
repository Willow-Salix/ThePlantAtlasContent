| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun (6+ hours direct light) for optimal flowering and fruiting, reflecting its growth in open woodlands and forest edges. |

## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
Pensacola Hawthorn thrives in full sun to partial shade within its native humid subtropical climate. It requires consistent moisture, particularly during establishment and dry spells. While relatively low-maintenance once mature, a moderate amount of fertilizer can support healthy growth if soil nutrients are deficient.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring if soil is poor, as it typically grows in moderately fertile soils.
