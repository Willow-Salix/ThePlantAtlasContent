## Care Guide
This heliotrope prefers full to partial sun and well-draining sandy soil, mimicking its native pine flatwoods habitat. It is drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and has low fertilizer demands. Overall, it thrives with minimal intervention in suitable conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilization needs, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, during the growing season.
