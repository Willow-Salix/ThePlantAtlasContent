### *Pinus L.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern Hemisphere, including North America (Canada, USA, Mexico), Europe, Asia (Siberia, China, Japan), and parts of North Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Predominantly Temperate Coniferous Forest and Boreal Forest (Taiga), also found in Mediterranean and montane regions. |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun (Full Sun). Pines are typically dominant canopy trees adapted to open, bright conditions, thriving with at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistent moisture but requires well-drained soil and should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot, mimicking natural forest floor conditions. Drought-tolerant once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
A pine is any conifer in the genus Pinus () of the family Pinaceae. Pinus is the sole genus in the subfamily Pinoideae. The species are evergreen trees or shrubs with their leaves in bunches, usually of 2 to 5 needles. The seeds are carried on woody cones, with two seeds to each cone scale.
Pines are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere; they occupy large areas of taiga (boreal forest), but are found in many habitats, including the Mediterranean Basin, and dry tropical forests in southeast Asia and Central America. Some are fire-resistant or fire-dependent. 
Pine trees provide one of the most extensively used types of timber. The seeds are used to make dishes such as pesto, while retsina wine is flavoured with pine resin.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pines thrive in full sun and prefer well-drained soil with moderate, consistent moisture, allowing the topsoil to dry out between waterings. They are not heavy feeders, requiring only light fertilization to support healthy growth in their natural, often lean, forest environments, making them relatively low-maintenance once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Pines are adapted to naturally lean forest soils and generally do not require heavy fertilization. A balanced, slow-release formula can be applied sparingly, typically once a year in spring, to support healthy growth.
