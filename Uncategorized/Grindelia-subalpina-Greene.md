## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (Rocky Mountains, including Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine/Subalpine Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, thriving in open, exposed locations characteristic of high-altitude grasslands. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent to moderate watering; it is drought-tolerant once established, preferring well-drained soil and prone to rot if overwatered, mimicking its native habitat's seasonal moisture and rapid drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Grindelia (gumweed) is a genus of plants native to the Americas belonging to the family Asteraceae. The genus was named for Latvian botanist David Hieronymus Grindel, 1776–1836.
They are herbaceous plants or subshrubs with annual, biennial, or perennial life cycles. The flowerheads are composed of numerous yellow disc florets (usually between 100–200) and from zero to sixty or more yellow or orange ray florets. Grindelia squarrosa, a plant with bright yellow flowers indigenous to much of the United States, is commonly called curlycup gumweed. Grindelia robusta, found in the western states, is a coastal scrub bush that is reputed to have several medicinal uses. Hairy gumweed, Grindelia cuneifolia, occurs in brackish coastal marshes of western North America, such as in some portions of the San Francisco Bay perimeter. The genus is native to South America, Mexico, and western North America, though some species have been introduced and naturalized in eastern North America and the Old World.
Grindelia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia mortua.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient subalpine plant requires full sun and exceptionally well-drained soil, mirroring its native mountain slopes. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and avoid rich fertilizers to promote robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low, as it is adapted to lean, rocky, and often nutrient-poor soils found in subalpine environments; avoid rich fertilization.
