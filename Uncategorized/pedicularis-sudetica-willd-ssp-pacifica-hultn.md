## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Pacific Lousewort, provide full to partial sun exposure and ensure the soil remains consistently moist, mimicking its native wet tundra habitat. Fertilization should be minimal to none, as it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions and is a hemiparasite. Protect from excessive heat and ensure good drainage while maintaining moisture.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; native tundra soils are nutrient-poor. As a hemiparasite, it obtains nutrients from host plants. Over-fertilization is likely harmful.
