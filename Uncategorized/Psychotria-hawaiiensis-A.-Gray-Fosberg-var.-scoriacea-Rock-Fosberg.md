## Introduction
Psychotria is a large genus of flowering plants in the coffee family Rubiaceae, with over 1,600 species. The genus has a pantropical distribution and members of the genus are small understorey trees in tropical forests. Some species are endangered or facing extinction due to deforestation, especially species of central Africa and the Pacific.
Many species, including Psychotria viridis, produce the psychedelic chemical dimethyltryptamine (DMT).

## Care Guide
To mimic its native Hawaiian wet forest habitat, provide Kopiko 'Ula with bright indirect light and consistently moist, well-drained soil. High humidity is crucial for its well-being. Fertilize sparingly during the growing months to support healthy foliage.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength monthly or bi-monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer).
