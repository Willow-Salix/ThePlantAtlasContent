## Care Guide
The Island Peacock Orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and excellent air circulation. Water thoroughly when dry, reducing frequency in cooler months, and provide dilute fertilizer during its active growing season to mimic its epiphytic, nutrient-scavenging nature.

### Fertilizer
Feed with a dilute, balanced orchid fertilizer (e.g., quarter strength) every 2-4 weeks during active growth, reducing or stopping completely during dormancy.
