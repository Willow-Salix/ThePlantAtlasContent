## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lupine thrives in full sun with excellent drainage, typical of its native serpentine soils in California's Coast Ranges. It requires minimal water once established, adapting to dry summers, and needs little to no fertilizer, especially nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume adapted to nutrient-poor (serpentine) soils, it is sensitive to rich soils and excessive nitrogen.
