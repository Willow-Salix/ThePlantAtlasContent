## Introduction
Angelica is a genus of about 90 species of tall biennial and perennial herbs in the family Apiaceae, native to temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, reaching as far north as Iceland, Sápmi, and Greenland. They grow to 1–3 m (3 ft 3 in – 9 ft 10 in) tall, with large bipinnate leaves and large compound umbels of white or greenish-white flowers. It shows variations in fruit anatomy, leaf morphology, and subterranean structures. The genes are extremely polymorphic.
Some species can be found in purple moor and rush pastures.

## Care Guide
California Angelica thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. It requires consistently damp soil and benefits from moderate fertility to support its robust growth. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, while maintaining constant moisture.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in moderately rich, well-draining soil. Supplement with a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer or compost in spring if soil fertility is low.
