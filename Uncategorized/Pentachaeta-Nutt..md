## Introduction
Pentachaeta is a genus of the family Asteraceae; the entire genus is endemic to California.  Of the six species members, at least one, Pentachaeta bellidiflora, is classified as an endangered species.  The etymology of the genus name derives from Greek penta, meaning five, and chaeta, meaning bristle, referring to the pappus scales of P. aurea. It was combined in Chaetopappa, but later work led to the genus being recognized as definitely separate. It is most closely related to Rigiopappus and Tracyina. Pygmydaisy is a common name for Pentachaeta.

## Care Guide
Pygmydaisies flourish in full sun conditions with well-drained soil, reflecting their native arid grassland habitats. They are highly drought-tolerant and require infrequent watering once established, along with minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally does not require fertilization. If desired, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once during the active growing season.
