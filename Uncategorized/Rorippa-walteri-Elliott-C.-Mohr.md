## Introduction
Rorippa is a globally distributed genus in the family Brassicaceae, with species occurring on all continents except for Antarctica. Rorippa species are natively distributed in the Northern Hemisphere through Eurasia and North America, and dispersed into the Southern Hemisphere through long-distance dispersal. Rorippa species are annual to perennial herbs, usually with yellow flowers and a peppery flavour. They are known commonly as yellowcresses.

## Care Guide
Southern Yellowcress thrives in perpetually wet conditions with rich, organic soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimic its natural habitat by ensuring constant soil saturation or shallow standing water, and provide regular fertilization to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. It prefers rich, organic, mucky soils typical of wetland environments, suggesting a need for regular nutrient replenishment.
