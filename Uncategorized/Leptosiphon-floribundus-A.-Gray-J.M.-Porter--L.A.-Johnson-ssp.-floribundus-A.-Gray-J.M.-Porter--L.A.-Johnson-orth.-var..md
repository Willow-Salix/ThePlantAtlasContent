## Care Guide
This California native flourishes in conditions mimicking its Mediterranean habitat. Provide full sun and well-draining soil, watering moderately during cooler growth periods and allowing it to dry out in summer. Minimal fertilization is generally sufficient.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. Typically does not require heavy fertilization; a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied in late winter if soil is very poor.
