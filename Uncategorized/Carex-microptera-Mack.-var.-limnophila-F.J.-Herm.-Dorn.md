## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in consistently wet to saturated soils, typical of its native montane wetland habitat. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil remains constantly moist. Fertilizer needs are low to moderate, focusing on organic matter enrichment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; native wetland soils are often rich in organic matter but overall nutrient availability can vary.
