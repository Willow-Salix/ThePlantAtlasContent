## Care Guide
American Vetch thrives in temperate North American climates, preferring full sun to partial shade in various open habitats. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities. This adaptable plant is relatively low-maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil and generally does not require heavy external fertilization.
