## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Europe (e.g., France, Spain, Portugal, Italy) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean |
| **Sunlight** | High Sun (Full Sun); typically found on exposed calcareous rocks or bark in open areas. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant; obtains moisture from ambient humidity, dew, and infrequent rainfall. Avoid consistently wet conditions, as prolonged dampness can be detrimental. |

## Introduction
Pyrenodesmia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Teloschistaceae. The genus currently includes 23 recognized species but is believed to contain many more unnamed taxa. The genus was circumscribed in 1852 by Italian lichenologist Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo. It is characterised by the complete absence of anthraquinones and the presence of Sedifolia-gray pigments in both the thallus and apothecia. These lichens are typically found in calcareous outcrops in the Northern Hemisphere, with biodiversity centres in the Mediterranean basin, Central Asia, and arid regions of western North America.

## Care Guide
This Mediterranean lichen thrives in full sun on calcareous surfaces, enduring long dry periods. It requires only ambient moisture from humidity or rainfall, and no supplemental feeding, as it's sensitive to nutrient overload.

### Fertilizer
Low nutrient requirements; obtains essential nutrients from the air and its substrate. Supplemental fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful.
