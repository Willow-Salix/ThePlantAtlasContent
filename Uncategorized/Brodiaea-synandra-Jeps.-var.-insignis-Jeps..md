## Introduction
Brodiaea , also known by the common name cluster-lilies, is a monocot genus of flowering plants.
One school of thought places the genus in the family Themidaceae, while another school of thought places it in the subfamily Brodiaeoideae of the family Asparagaceae.  The USDA Plants Database still classifies the genus Brodiaea in the family Liliaceae.
Brodiaea species occur along the Pacific Coast region of North America, from British Columbia throughout California into the Baja California Peninsula. They are especially common in northern California.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in a Mediterranean climate with wet winters and dry summers. Provide ample sun, well-draining soil, and consistent watering during its winter-spring growth period. Allow it to go completely dry and dormant during the summer months.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, low-strength fertilizer can be applied once during the growing season, or a slow-release granular fertilizer in fall.
