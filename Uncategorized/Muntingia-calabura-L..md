## Care Guide
This fast-growing tropical tree flourishes in full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its native open tropical habitats. Regular watering, especially when fruiting, and a balanced fertilizer regime will support its vigorous growth and abundant fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer, particularly during its active growing and fruiting seasons, due to its rapid growth and productivity.
