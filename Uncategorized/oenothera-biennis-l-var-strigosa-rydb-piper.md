## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its open native grassland habitat. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and requires only low to moderate fertilizer due to its adaptability to less fertile soils. Overall, it's a hardy plant preferring well-drained soil and abundant light.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Naturally grows in average to poor, often disturbed soils, so excessive fertilization is not required. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly if soil nutrients are very low.
