## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern North America, specifically the St. John River valley in northern Maine (USA) and New Brunswick (Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (riparian zones within a Humid Continental climate), characterized by cold winters, warm, moist summers, and periodic flooding |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Its natural habitat on river banks suggests it can tolerate direct sun exposure. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial, especially during the growing season. It tolerates periodic saturation due to its riparian nature but requires good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Not drought-tolerant. |

## Care Guide
Furbish's Aster thrives in conditions mimicking its native riparian habitat, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is crucial to avoid drought, and it benefits from low to moderate fertility.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Its native habitat on gravel bars and floodplains suggests it can thrive in soils that are not overly rich but benefit from some periodic nutrient deposition.
