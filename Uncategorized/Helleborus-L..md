| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade, particularly afternoon shade. Can tolerate more sun in cooler climates or during winter when deciduous trees are bare. |

## Introduction
Commonly known as hellebores (), the Eurasian genus Helleborus consists of approximately 20 species of herbaceous or evergreen perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, within which it gave its name to the tribe of Helleboreae. Many hellebore species are poisonous.
Despite common names such as winter rose, Christmas rose, and Lenten rose, hellebores are not closely related to the rose family (Rosaceae).

## Care Guide
Hellebores flourish in partial to full shade with rich, consistently moist yet well-drained soil, mirroring their native woodland habitats. Provide moderate fertility through organic matter and ensure adequate moisture, especially during dry spells, to support their striking winter blooms.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from an annual top-dressing of compost or a balanced slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring.
