## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including arctic and alpine zones of Europe, Asia, and North America (e.g., Alps, Himalayas, Rockies) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in high light exposure typical of treeless alpine and arctic environments, but also tolerates some shade in higher altitudes. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging, mimicking conditions of melting snow and well-drained rocky soils. |

## Introduction
Sibbaldia is a genus of flowering plants of the family Rosaceae, with a circumpolar distribution, including the high Arctic. The type species is Sibbaldia procumbens. It is also in the Rosoideae subfamily.
The genus name of Sibbaldia is in honour of Robert Sibbald (1641–1722), a Scottish physician and antiquary. It was first described in 1753.

## Care Guide
Sibbaldia thrives in bright, cool conditions with consistently moist yet very well-drained soil, replicating its native alpine and arctic tundra environments. It requires minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils. Ensure it receives ample light and protection from excessive heat.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. Native soils are generally nutrient-poor; excessive fertilization can harm the plant. A very dilute, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, if at all.
