## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Asia (e.g., Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan), parts of Afghanistan, Iran, and the Caucasus region |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Steppe/Semi-Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open and exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Stipa is a genus of about 140 species of large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and  spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to Stipa, which have since been reclassified into new genera.
Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as Stipa brachytricha, S. arundinacea, S. splendens, S. gigantea and S. pulchra are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.
It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established due to its excellent drought tolerance. Fertilization is rarely necessary as it is accustomed to lean native soils, making it a highly low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. These plants are adapted to lean soils; over-fertilization can be detrimental. If needed, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is sufficient.
