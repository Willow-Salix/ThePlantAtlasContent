## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Europe, Asia, and North Africa, particularly the Mediterranean Basin |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Meadow, Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring full sun for robust growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the top layer of soil to dry out between waterings. It tolerates some drought once established but thrives with consistent moisture. |

## Introduction
Vicia sativa, known as the common vetch, garden vetch, tare or simply vetch, is a nitrogen-fixing leguminous plant in the family Fabaceae. It is now naturalised throughout the world occurring on every continent, except Antarctica and the Arctic. The centre of diversity is thought to be the Fertile Crescent, although gold standard molecular confirmation is currently not available. 
Global common vetch cultivation is limited due to anti-nutritional compounds in the seed although it is grown in dryland agricultural zones in Australia, China and Ethiopia due to its drought tolerance and very low nutrient requirements compared to other legumes. In these agricultural zones common vetch is grown as a green manure, livestock fodder or rotation crop. In cultivated grainfields, like lentils, it is often considered a weed due to downgrading of harvested mixed grain, resulting in farmers receiving less financial returns.

## Care Guide
Narrow-leaved Vetch is a resilient, nitrogen-fixing annual that thrives in full sun within temperate climates. It requires moderate watering and minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant. This species is highly adaptable and benefits overall soil health.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs, especially for nitrogen, due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. A balanced phosphorus and potassium supplement might be beneficial in nutrient-poor soils.
