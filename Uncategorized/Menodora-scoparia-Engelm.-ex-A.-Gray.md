## Care Guide
Broom Menodora thrives in full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its arid native desert environment. It is extremely drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and performs best with minimal to no fertilization. Mimicking these harsh conditions is essential for its care.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in lean, well-draining, and often rocky soils, as found in its native desert habitat. Excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
