## Introduction
Lesquerella is the former name of a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Recent work has shown that Lesquerella is indistinct from the genus Physaria and both genera have been united under Physaria. In addition, the former Lesquerella of the southeastern United States have been moved to the genus Paysonia since 2002. The genus Lesquerella is now no longer applied to any species and is considered defunct.
The genus is named in honor of Leo Lesquereux, 1805–1889, Swiss and American botanist.

## Care Guide
Mid Bladderpod is a highly drought-tolerant plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Arizona. It thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, preferring to dry out completely between irrigations. Fertilization is rarely necessary, as it adapts well to lean, well-drained soils.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; generally thrives in lean to average, well-drained soils without rich nutrient supplementation. Fertilize minimally, if at all.
