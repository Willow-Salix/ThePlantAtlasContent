## Introduction
Deschampsia is a genus of plants in the grass family Poaceae, commonly known as hair grass or tussock grass. The genus is widespread across many countries.
The genus is named for French physician and naturalist Louis Auguste Deschamps (1765–1842).
Deschampsia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera, including antler moth, the clay, clouded-bordered brindle, common wainscot, dark arches, dusky brocade, shoulder-striped wainscot, smoky wainscot and wall.
Deschampsia sometimes grow in boggy acidic formations, an example of which is the Portlethen Moss, Scotland. 
Deschampsia antarctica is the world's most southern monocot, and one of only two flowering plants of Antarctica.
Some species, such as D. cespitosa, are grown as ornamental garden plants.

## Care Guide
This hardy grass is adapted to cold, exposed conditions. Provide full sun exposure and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained throughout its active growing period. Due to its native habitat, it has very low nutrient demands and should not be over-fertilized.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor, so minimal or no fertilization is required. A dilute, balanced fertilizer may be applied once in spring if growth appears weak.
