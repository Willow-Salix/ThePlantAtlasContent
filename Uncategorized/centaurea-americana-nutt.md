## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient prairie native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring conditions that mimic its open grassland habitat. It tolerates drought once established and requires moderate watering, with minimal fertilization generally needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typically thrives in average to moderately fertile soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil nutrients are poor.
