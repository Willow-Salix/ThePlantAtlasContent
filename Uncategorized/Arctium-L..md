## Introduction
Arctium is a genus of biennial plants commonly known as burdock, family Asteraceae. Native to Europe and Asia, several species have been widely introduced worldwide.

## Care Guide
Burdock, native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, prefers full sun to partial shade, mimicking its natural habitat in meadows and forest edges. Provide moderate, consistent watering and avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to average soil conditions. This plant is quite resilient, flourishing with minimal fuss once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally thrives in average soil and does not require heavy fertilization.
