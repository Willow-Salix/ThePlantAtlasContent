## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Southern United States (e.g., Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Louisiana, Texas) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in open woodlands, glades, and prairies) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers at least 6 hours of direct sun daily for optimal flowering. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Water regularly during dry spells, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established but dislikes waterlogged conditions. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
Arkansas Beardtongue thrives in full sun with well-draining soil, preferring moderate moisture and allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. It is generally low-maintenance regarding fertilization, thriving with minimal supplemental nutrients. This plant is well-adapted to its native humid subtropical environment and tolerates some drought once established.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. Can benefit from a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring if soil is very poor, but generally thrives in lean to moderately rich soils without heavy feeding. Avoid excessive nitrogen.
