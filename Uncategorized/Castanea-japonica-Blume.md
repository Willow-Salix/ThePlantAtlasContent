## Introduction
Castanea crenata, the Japanese chestnut or Korean chestnut, is a species of chestnut native to Japan and Korea. Castanea crenata exhibits resistance to Phytophthora cinnamomi, the fungal pathogen that causes ink disease in several Castanea species. The mechanism of resistance of Castanea crenata to Phytophthora cinnamomi may derive from its expression of the Cast_Gnk2-like gene.

## Care Guide
The Japanese Chestnut requires a full sun exposure and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native temperate forest habitat. Regular watering during dry spells and annual fertilization with organic matter or a balanced feed will support healthy growth and nut yield.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in fertile, organically rich soil. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, or annually incorporate compost and other organic matter to replenish nutrients, particularly for young trees and those bearing fruit.
