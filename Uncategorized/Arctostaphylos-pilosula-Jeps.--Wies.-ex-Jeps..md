## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Inner South Coast Ranges of California, USA (San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties, particularly La Panza Range) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland/Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sun daily) to ensure robust growth and flowering, as it naturally occurs in open, exposed landscapes. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant once established. Requires infrequent to no summer watering, particularly after its first year. Overwatering can lead to root rot; prefers well-draining soil and dry conditions during its dormant summer period. |

## Introduction
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## Care Guide
La Panza Manzanita is a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant shrub ideal for Mediterranean climates. It requires full sun, excellent drainage, and very little supplemental water once established. Avoid over-fertilizing and provide minimal summer irrigation to ensure its health and longevity.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needs. Thrives in nutrient-poor, native soils and can be harmed by excessive fertilization. If soil is exceptionally poor, a very light application of a native plant formula once a year in fall may be considered, but is usually unnecessary.
