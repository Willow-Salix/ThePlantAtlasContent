## Care Guide
Catchfly thrives in full sun to partial shade within temperate climates. It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, becoming quite drought-tolerant once established. Fertilizer needs are minimal, as it adapts well to average to poor soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Typically thrives in nutrient-poor to average soils and does not require heavy fertilization.
