## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal and montane regions across North America (e.g., Alaska, western Canada, Appalachians), Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine/Montane Wet Temperate (found in cold mountain streams and lakes at high elevations) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to indirect bright light. Can tolerate some direct morning sun if kept consistently cool and moist, especially when submerged. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant moisture; keep perpetually wet or very damp, ideally mimicking its native submerged or emergent conditions in streams. High ambient humidity is crucial. |

## Introduction
Amblystegiaceae is a family of mosses. It includes 20 to 30 genera with a total of up to 150 species. They occur nearly worldwide, growing in tropical, temperate, and subpolar regions.
These mosses are small to large in size and are yellow, green, or brown in color. Some are aquatic and some terrestrial. Most occur in wet habitat types. Many occur in substrates with a basic pH, but some grow in neutral to acidic substrates.

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cold, perpetually wet conditions, mimicking its native alpine stream environment. Ensure constant moisture, high humidity, and provide partial shade to indirect bright light to prevent desiccation and maintain cool temperatures. Fertilizer is generally not required.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Mosses are not heavy feeders and can be harmed by high nutrient concentrations. They typically absorb sufficient nutrients from water and the surrounding environment.
