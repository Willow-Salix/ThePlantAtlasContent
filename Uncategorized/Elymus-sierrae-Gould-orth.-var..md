## Care Guide
The Sierra Nevada Wildrye thrives in full to partial sun, adapting to the cool, dry-summer conditions of its native montane habitat. It requires moderate watering during its growth period, becoming drought-tolerant with maturity, and generally needs minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Typically thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring if soil is very poor.
