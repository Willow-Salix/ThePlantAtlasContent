# Heteropteris Fée
### *Heteropteris FÃ©e*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and South America, particularly Brazil, Mexico, and other Neotropical regions. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Forests, including rainforest edges, gallery forests, and savannas. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. As many species are understory plants or climb within forests, they are not adapted to intense, direct sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, mimicking regular tropical rainfall. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in warm, humid conditions with consistent moisture and bright, indirect light to partial shade. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging while maintaining soil moisture. Fertilize moderately during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease feeding during cooler, darker months.
