## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and highly humid environments with low to partial light, mimicking its native forest floor habitat. Ensure good drainage to prevent rot and avoid direct sun and excessive fertilization to maintain its delicate growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses obtain nutrients from their environment and are sensitive to high salt concentrations. If absolutely necessary, use an extremely diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very infrequently.
