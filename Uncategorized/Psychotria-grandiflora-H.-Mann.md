## Introduction
Psychotria is a large genus of flowering plants in the coffee family Rubiaceae, with over 1,600 species. The genus has a pantropical distribution and members of the genus are small understorey trees in tropical forests. Some species are endangered or facing extinction due to deforestation, especially species of central Africa and the Pacific.
Many species, including Psychotria viridis, produce the psychedelic chemical dimethyltryptamine (DMT).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions reminiscent of its native Hawaiian wet forests. Provide bright indirect light, ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained, and maintain high humidity. Fertilize lightly during its growth period.

### Fertilizer
Benefit from regular, diluted feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season, consistent with nutrient availability from forest floor decomposition.
