## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (southern Alaska south through British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, to northern California, and east to Montana and Idaho) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Moist (often found in moist rocky areas, stream banks, wet meadows, and cliffs) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to bright indirect light; benefits from protection from intense afternoon sun, especially in warmer climates. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimic the constant moisture from snowmelt and rainfall in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, consistently moist, well-drained conditions, typical of its subalpine rocky habitat. Provide partial shade to bright indirect light, avoiding harsh afternoon sun. Water regularly to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged, and fertilize very sparingly, if at all.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. Grows in naturally lean, rocky soils. If fertilized, use a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly during the active growing season.
