## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, Asia, North America), extending to high altitudes in tropical and Southern Hemisphere mountains (e.g., Andes, East Africa, New Zealand, Tasmania). |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forests, Subarctic Tundra, and Alpine Moorlands |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to indirect bright light. In its natural habitat, it often grows under a canopy or in exposed but cool, humid conditions. Avoid harsh, direct afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, but not waterlogged, soil. High humidity is crucial. Water frequently, ensuring excellent drainage, and do not allow the soil to dry out completely. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Fir Clubmoss thrives in cool, humid environments with consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its native temperate and alpine habitats. Provide indirect bright light, protect from intense sun and heat, and ensure high ambient humidity for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Very low. It typically grows in nutrient-poor soils. If desired, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once a month) during the active growing season, or omit entirely.
