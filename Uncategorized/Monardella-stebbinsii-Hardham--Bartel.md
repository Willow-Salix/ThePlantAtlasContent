## Introduction
Monardella is a genus of approximately 40 species of annual and perennial plants native to western North America from British Columbia to northwestern Mexico. They are grown for their highly aromatic foliage, which in some species is used for herbal teas. The two-lipped, tubular flowers are formed in terminal clusters and are most usually red, pink, or purple.
Monardella is a Latin diminutive form of Monarda (a taxonomic patronym honoring the Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes), which the form of the flower heads resembles.  Plants in this genus are commonly known as wildmints, coyote mints or monardellas.

## Care Guide
Feather River Monardella requires full sun and thrives in poor, well-draining soils, reflecting its native Mediterranean chaparral habitat. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and needs minimal to no fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; thrives in poor, nutrient-deficient soils, including serpentine soils.
