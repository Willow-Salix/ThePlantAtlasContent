## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (specifically Inner North Coast Ranges, Sierra Nevada foothills, Transverse Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Chaparral, Foothill Woodland Biome) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) to partial sun. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. More frequent watering may be needed during its primary growing season in spring, but always ensure excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This Californian native thrives in dry, sunny conditions typical of chaparral and foothill woodlands. Plant in well-draining soil and provide full sun exposure. Once established, water sparingly, allowing soil to dry out between waterings, and avoid over-fertilizing.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. These plants are adapted to lean soils; over-fertilization can be detrimental. If soil is very poor, a light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, at half the recommended strength, may be applied.
