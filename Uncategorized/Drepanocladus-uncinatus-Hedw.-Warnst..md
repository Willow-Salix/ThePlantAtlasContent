## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal and Circumpolar regions, including Arctic, Boreal, and high-altitude Alpine zones across North America, Eurasia, and the Southern Hemisphere. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Boreal Forest, and Subpolar/Polar regions, characterized by cool temperatures, high humidity, and consistent moisture from snowmelt or rainfall. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to indirect light. This moss typically grows in shaded or semi-shaded conditions, often under forest canopies or among rocks, so direct intense sunlight should be avoided. |
| **Watering** | High and constant moisture. The plant needs a consistently damp, but not waterlogged, substrate and high ambient humidity. Frequent watering or misting is essential to prevent drying out. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, humid environments with constant moisture and indirect light, mimicking its native arctic, boreal, and alpine habitats. Ensure the substrate remains damp and humidity is high, avoiding direct sun and waterlogging. Fertilizer is rarely, if ever, needed.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses are not heavy feeders and obtain most of their nutrients from precipitation and airborne particles. Supplemental fertilizer is generally unnecessary and can be harmful if overapplied.
