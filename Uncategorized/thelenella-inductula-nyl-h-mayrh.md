## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Broadly distributed across tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, including southeastern North America (e.g., Florida, Louisiana), Central and South America (e.g., Brazil), parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, and Oceania (e.g., Queensland, Australia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Humid Forests (often in old-growth or sheltered areas with consistently high humidity and rainfall). |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light. Thrives in deeply shaded or filtered light conditions, avoiding any direct sun exposure which can lead to rapid desiccation and stress. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires very high atmospheric humidity and frequent moisture. Should be regularly misted, especially in dry conditions, or placed in an environment with consistently high ambient humidity (e.g., terrarium). The substrate (bark, rock) should remain consistently moist but not waterlogged. |

## 🌱 Overview
Thelenella is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Thelenellaceae. These inconspicuous lichens form thin, crust-like growths that are tightly attached to their substrates and appear as dull whitish, pale grey, or light brown patches. Species of Thelenella are commonly found in damp, shaded environments where they grow on tree bark, living leaves, moss cushions, rock faces, and moss-rich soil. The genus is distinguished by its thick-walled fruiting bodies that are mostly embedded within the lichen crust and contain multicellular spores with multiple cross-walls.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in environments mimicking its native tropical and subtropical humid forest habitats. Provide consistently high humidity, frequent misting, and very low to indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight and traditional fertilizers, as they can be detrimental to its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required. Lichens absorb necessary nutrients from the air and precipitation; added fertilizers can be harmful and lead to nutrient imbalances or salt accumulation.
