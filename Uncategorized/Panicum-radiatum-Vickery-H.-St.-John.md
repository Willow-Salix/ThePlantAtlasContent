## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and requires consistent moisture during its active growth period, mimicking its tropical and subtropical native habitat with distinct wet and dry seasons. It is adapted to moderate soil fertility and does not generally demand heavy feeding, making it a low-maintenance option.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Being a native grass, it is adapted to moderately fertile soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year during its main growing season is generally sufficient.
