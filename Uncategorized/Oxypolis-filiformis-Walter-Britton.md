## Care Guide
Water Cowbane is a wetland plant native to the southeastern US, demanding consistently wet to saturated soil and preferring full to partial sun. It thrives in conditions mimicking its natural boggy habitats, requiring moderate nutrient levels for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate, balanced fertilization during the growing season, especially if planted in poor soils; otherwise, adapted to the naturally moderate fertility of wetland soils.
