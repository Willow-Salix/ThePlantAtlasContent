## Care Guide
The Western Redbud is a hardy, drought-tolerant tree preferring full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. It requires minimal watering and fertilization once established, making it suitable for low-maintenance landscapes in dry climates.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally not needed for established plants. May benefit from a light, balanced fertilizer in very poor soils during early growth.
