## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for this aquatic or semi-aquatic moss, provide a consistently moist environment, ideally submerged in clean water or in a terrarium with very high humidity. Keep it away from direct, intense sunlight and avoid supplemental fertilization as it has extremely low nutrient requirements.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; mosses acquire sufficient nutrients from their water and environment, and traditional fertilizers are often detrimental.
