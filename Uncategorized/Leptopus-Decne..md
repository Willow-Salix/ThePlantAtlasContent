| **Climate** | Subtropical Dry to Temperate Semi-Arid, often found in montane scrublands or grasslands. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, exposed locations, indicative of its native habitat on slopes and grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Drought tolerant; requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce frequency during cooler, dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Leptopus, the maidenbushes, are a genus of plants in the family Phyllanthaceae native to southern Asia from the Caucasus east to China and Maluku. The plants are monoecious herbs and shrubs with simple, entire leaves and small, green flowers.
Leptopus is one of eight genera in the tribe Poranthereae and comprises 9 species. It is the sister of Actephila. The type species is Leptopus cordifolius.  The name is derived from two Greek words, leptos, "thin, slender, or small", and pous, "foot", a reference to slender pedicels. The genus was first described in 1836 and revised in 2009.
Leptopus fangdingianus had been placed by some authors in a separate genus, Archileptopus, but it was shown in 2007 that recognition of Archileptopus makes Leptopus paraphyletic.  Phyllanthopsis phyllanthoides has been placed in Leptopus as well as in Andrachne. In 2007, it was shown to not properly belong to either genus and in 2008 was assigned to a new genus, Phyllanthopsis.

## Care Guide
Maidenbush thrives in full to partial sun with excellent drainage, reflecting its native dry, rocky environments. It is highly drought tolerant, needing infrequent watering once established, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Prioritize well-drained soil and ample sunlight for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season, especially in naturally poorer soils.
