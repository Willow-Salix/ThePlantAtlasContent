## Introduction
Pitcher plants are  carnivorous plants that have modified leaves known as pitfall traps—prey-trapping mechanisms featuring a deep cavity filled with digestive liquid. The traps of what are considered to be "true" pitcher plants are formed by specialized leaves. The plants attract and drown the prey with nectar.

## Care Guide
Sarracenia Ã—moorei thrives in conditions mimicking its native bog habitat: constant full sun and consistently wet, nutrient-poor soil. Use only pure water (distilled, RO, or rainwater) and never fertilize the soil, as the plant acquires its nutrients from insects.

### Fertilizer
None. These carnivorous plants obtain nutrients from insects they catch. Fertilizing the soil can burn the roots and kill the plant.
