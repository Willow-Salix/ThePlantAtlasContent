## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest (e.g., Washington, Oregon) and northern Intermountain West (e.g., Idaho, Montana). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane Meadow / Subalpine Grassland, characterized by cool, moist springs and warm, dry summers. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, particularly needing bright conditions in early spring before the plant goes dormant for summer. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist during its active growth period in spring. Allow soil to dry out completely once the foliage dies back for summer dormancy to prevent rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Primula sect. Dodecatheon is a section of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. Primula species in this section were formerly placed in a separate genus, Dodecatheon. The species have basal clumps of leaves and nodding flowers that are produced at the top of tall stems rising from where the leaves join the crown. The genus is largely confined to North America and part of northeastern Siberia. Common names include shooting star, American cowslip, mosquito bills, mad violets, and sailor caps. A few species are grown in gardens for their showy and unique flower display.
The stamens are thrust out with the sepals bent back. The flowers are pollinated by bees, which grab hold of the petals, and gather pollen by vibrating the flowers by buzzing their wings (buzz pollination). The vibration releases pollen from the anthers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Bonneville Shootingstar, a spring ephemeral native to temperate montane meadows, thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistent moisture during its spring bloom. It is crucial to provide a dry dormant period in summer and plant in well-draining soil with minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is generally required. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial in nutrient-poor soils.
