## Care Guide
California Oatgrass is a resilient native grass adapted to western North American grasslands and open woodlands. It thrives in full sun with minimal water once established, requiring lean to moderate soil and little to no fertilization. This plant is ideal for low-maintenance, drought-tolerant landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils and does not require regular fertilization. Over-fertilization can reduce its natural vigor and competitive ability.
