## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with excellent drainage, typical of its native sandhills and dry woodlands. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, and fertilize sparingly as it is adapted to poor nutrient conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor soils, so a light application of balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, if needed at all.
