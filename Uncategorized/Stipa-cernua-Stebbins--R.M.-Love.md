## Introduction
Stipa is a genus of about 140 species of large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and  spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to Stipa, which have since been reclassified into new genera.
Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as Stipa brachytricha, S. arundinacea, S. splendens, S. gigantea and S. pulchra are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.
It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.

## Care Guide
Nodding Needlegrass is a drought-tolerant California native perfectly suited for full sun and lean, well-draining soils. It requires infrequent deep watering once established, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate of dry summers and wet winters. Avoid heavy fertilization to ensure optimal health and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; thrives in lean, well-draining soils.
