## Care Guide
California Tickseed thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native dry-summer Mediterranean habitat. Water moderately during its spring growing season, then reduce significantly as it enters summer dormancy, benefiting from minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to lean soils; excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
