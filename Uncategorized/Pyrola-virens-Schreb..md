## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including northern North America (Canada, northern US), Europe (Scandinavia, Central Europe), and Asia (Siberia). |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest and Temperate Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial to full shade, thriving in the understory of dense forests. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can scorch its leaves. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist but well-drained soil, typical of forest floors. Water regularly to maintain moisture, especially during dry spells, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging and root rot. |

## Introduction
Pyrola  is a genus of evergreen herbaceous plants in the family Ericaceae. Under the old Cronquist system it was placed in its own family Pyrolaceae, but genetic research showed it belonged in the family Ericaceae. The species are commonly known as wintergreen, a name shared with several other related and unrelated plants (see wintergreen for details). They are native to northern temperate and Arctic regions.
They are rather small plants with a rosette of simple orbicular or ovate leaves, with a flower stem bearing generally rather lax racemes of simple white, cream or pink flowers. The immediate distinguishing feature of Pyrola species is the flower style which is often curved, sticks out beyond the petals and is expanded below the stigma which itself is branched into several lobes. To the casual observer the flower appears to have a small bell-clapper sticking out.

## Care Guide
Green Wintergreen thrives in cool, shaded conditions with consistently moist, acidic, and well-drained soil, mimicking its native forest understory. It requires minimal light and fertilizer. Ensure good drainage and avoid strong, direct sunlight for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils common in its native habitat. A very light, balanced, acid-loving plant fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring, but over-fertilization is detrimental.
