## Introduction
Hedyotis (starviolet) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. Many species of this genus such as Hedyotis biflora, H. corymbosa and H. diffusa are well known medicinal plants. Hedyotis is native to tropical and subtropical Asia and to islands of the northwest Pacific. It comprises about 115 species. The type species for the genus is Hedyotis fruticosa.
Hedyotis was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in Species Plantarum. This generic name is derived from two Greek words, hedys, "sweet", and otos, "ear", in reference to the sweet-scented, ear-shaped leaves of some species.

## Care Guide
This tropical plant thrives in warm, humid conditions with consistently moist soil, reflecting its origins in monsoon regions. It is quite adaptable to light, tolerating full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile groundcover or garden plant. Provide regular watering and minimal fertilizer to best emulate its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; a balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season, as it thrives in relatively unamended soils.
