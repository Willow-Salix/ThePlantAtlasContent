## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant requires full sun and exceptionally well-drained, lean soil to thrive. Water moderately, allowing the substrate to dry between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization due to its adaptation to poor soils and nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Alpine soils are typically nutrient-poor, and as a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen.
