## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Intermountain West, Rocky Mountains, including states like Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, California, Oregon) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland to Alpine/Subalpine (characterized by dry conditions, intense sun, well-drained rocky soils, and significant temperature fluctuations) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its open, high-elevation native habitats) |
| **💧 Water** | Very low (highly drought-tolerant; allow soil to dry out completely between sparse waterings, especially after establishment, mimicking arid native conditions) |

## 🌱 Overview
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and requires very well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native arid and alpine environments. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing minimal watering once established, and fertilizer is generally unnecessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None to very low (natively found in nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils; excessive fertilizer can be detrimental)
