## Introduction
Stenostomidae is a family of freshwater catenulid flatworms. It is the most species-rich family of catenulids, with about 70 species described, most of them in the Neotropics.
Catenulids of the family Stenostomidae are characterized by the brain divided into four clearly separated lobes, two anterior and two posterior, which lie near the mouth. The preoral zone contains a group of sensor cells with ciliated pits organized in long precerebral series.

## Care Guide
Stenostomum acutatum thrives in warm, humid environments with consistent moisture, mirroring its native tropical forest understory. Provide bright, indirect light and keep the soil evenly moist, while offering light fertilization during periods of active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer), reducing frequency in cooler months.
