| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Very low; drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, tolerating significant drought periods. It prefers well-draining, lean to poor soil and typically does not require regular fertilization. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Very low; adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary or should be very light and infrequent with a balanced, slow-release formula.
