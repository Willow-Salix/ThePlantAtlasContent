## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, including southeastern Canada and the eastern United States (from Minnesota and Arkansas east to the Atlantic coast, and south to Georgia). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest floor |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium, indirect light. Prefers dappled or deep shade, mimicking its forest understory habitat. Avoid direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. Requires good drainage to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Goodyera, commonly called rattlesnake plantain, jade orchids or ladies' tresses is a wide-ranging genus of orchids in the tribe Cranichideae. About 100 species of Goodyera have been formally described. With a center of diversity in East Asia, Goodyera is found across Europe, Madeira, North and Central America, Australia, and on islands from the west Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. They have a rosette of leaves at their base and usually many small white resupinate flowers. They are similar to orchids in the genus Spiranthes but can be distinguished from them by the shape and colour patterns of the leaves.

## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate forest floor: consistent, dappled indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining, humus-rich soil. Ensure adequate humidity and avoid over-fertilizing to promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low feeder. Use a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer (1/4 strength) once a month during the growing season, or incorporate organic matter like leaf mold into the potting mix. Avoid over-fertilizing.
