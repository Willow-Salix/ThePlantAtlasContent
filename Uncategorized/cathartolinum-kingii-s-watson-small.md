# King's Flax
### *Cathartolinum kingii (S. Watson) Small*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Intermountain West region of the United States (e.g., Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Montane Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open, exposed areas with sparse canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant, consistent with its adaptation to arid environments and well-drained, often rocky, soils. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
King's Flax thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native arid scrubland and montane environments. It requires infrequent watering once established due to its drought tolerance and generally does not need heavy fertilization, preferring lean conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, as it is adapted to lean, rocky, or sandy soils typical of its native habitat. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
