## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Steven's Sedge thrives in cool, exposed conditions, requiring full to partial sun. It necessitates consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native alpine tundra habitat. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum, as it is naturally adapted to nutrient-scarce environments.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor alpine and tundra soils, requiring minimal, infrequent fertilization.
