# Witch's Hair Lichen

*Alectoria sarmentosa (Ach.) Ach.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar in the Northern Hemisphere, including boreal and montane regions of North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Alaska, Canada), Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Alps), and Asia (e.g., Siberia). |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest / Taiga and Montane/Alpine regions, characterized by cool to cold temperatures, high humidity, and frequent precipitation (rain, snow, fog). |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. As an epiphytic lichen in often cloudy or forested environments, it should be protected from direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and moisture from ambient air or misting. It absorbs moisture directly from the atmosphere; avoid submerging or allowing it to sit in standing water. |

## Care Guide
Witch's Hair Lichen thrives in cool, very humid environments with bright indirect light or partial shade, mimicking its native boreal and montane habitats. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture through high ambient humidity or regular misting, but no traditional watering or fertilization.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens are sensitive to nutrient salts and derive their necessary elements from air and rainwater.
