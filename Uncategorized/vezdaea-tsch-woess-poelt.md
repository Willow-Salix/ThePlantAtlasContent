## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia) and Australasia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Forests, Boreal Forests, characterized by consistent moisture, high humidity, and often found in shaded, mossy microhabitats. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to partial, indirect light. Protect from direct, intense sunlight, which can lead to desiccation and damage. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high humidity and regular moisture, typically absorbed from the environment (rain, dew, mist). Avoid complete drying out; occasional misting in dry indoor environments may be beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Vezdaea is a genus of crustose lichens in the monotypic family Vezdaeaceae, which itself is the only taxon in the order Vezdaeales. The genus was established in 1976 and named after the Czech lichenologist Antonín Vězda for his contributions to lichen science. These lichens form extremely thin crusts that appear as dustings of tiny greenish to grey particles on decaying moss, plant debris, and soil, particularly in metal-enriched environments that other lichens avoid. The genus contains 14 species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Vezdaea lichens thrive in cool, humid environments with low to moderate indirect light. Provide consistent moisture through high ambient humidity and avoid any direct sun exposure or fertilization. They do not require traditional watering or nutrient input.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required or recommended. Lichens derive necessary nutrients from airborne particles and rainwater, and excess nutrients can be harmful.
