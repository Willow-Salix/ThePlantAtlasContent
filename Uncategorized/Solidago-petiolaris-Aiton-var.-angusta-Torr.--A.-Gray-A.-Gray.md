## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
This resilient goldenrod requires minimal care, thriving in full to partial sun with well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant once established and does not typically need supplemental fertilizer, making it a low-maintenance choice for native plantings or naturalized areas.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it naturally occurs in average to poor soils and does not require rich fertilization.
