## Care Guide
Columbia Panicgrass is an adaptable native grass from temperate woodlands and grasslands. It thrives in conditions ranging from full sun to partial shade and prefers moderate, consistent moisture, though it is quite drought-tolerant once established. Minimal fertilization is generally needed for this hardy plant.
