## Care Guide
Lingonberries are hardy, acid-loving plants that require consistent moisture and well-drained soil in cold temperate to arctic conditions. They thrive in full sun to partial shade and have minimal nutrient needs, making over-fertilization detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient requirements; prefers acidic, poor soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, acid-loving plant fertilizer.
