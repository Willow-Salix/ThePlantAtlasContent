## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western Europe, particularly upland and montane regions including Ireland, UK, and Scandinavia |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, thriving on exposed siliceous rock surfaces in its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Relies on high atmospheric humidity and frequent precipitation (rain, fog, dew) for moisture; tolerates periods of desiccation but requires regular wetting to become metabolically active. |

## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
Rim lichen, found on exposed rocks in temperate uplands, requires full to partial sun and high atmospheric humidity or frequent precipitation to thrive. It does not need traditional watering or fertilization, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and its substrate.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; obtains trace nutrients directly from rainwater, atmospheric deposition, and the dissolution of its rock substrate. Not typically fertilized.
