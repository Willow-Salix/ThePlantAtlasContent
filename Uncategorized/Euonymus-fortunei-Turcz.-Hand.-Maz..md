## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Asia (primarily China, Japan, Korea) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Forests, Woodlands, and Rocky Slopes |
| **Sunlight** | Adaptable, thriving in partial sun to full sun. In its native habitat, it can be found both in the understory and more open areas, suggesting tolerance for varied light. Prefers partial sun to partial shade in hotter climates to prevent leaf scorch. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil. Its native regions experience moderate to high rainfall, indicating a need for regular moisture. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings; tolerant of some drought once established. |

## Care Guide
Winter Creeper is a highly adaptable plant native to East Asian temperate and subtropical forests, thriving in a range from partial to full sun with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide moderate fertilization to support its vigorous growth. This hardy plant is relatively low-maintenance once established, reflecting its resilience in diverse natural settings.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Native forest soils are often rich in organic matter. Benefits from an annual application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring to support its vigorous growth, especially in poorer soils.
