## Introduction
Physostegia, the lionshearts or false dragonheads  (in reference to their similarity to Dracocephalum), is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae, native to North America (United States, Canada, northern Mexico). They are erect rhizomatous herbaceous perennials inhabiting damp, sunny places. 
They grow up to 2 m (7 ft) tall with purple or pink tubular flowers in racemes in summer.
The generic name comes from two Greek words, physa (a bladder) and stege (a covering), referring to the calyx, which becomes full of fruit when mature.
Physostegia virginiana is the most common species, and is known as "obedient plant".

## Care Guide
This wetland native thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist to wet soil, making it ideal for rain gardens or pond edges. It is relatively unfussy about nutrients but appreciates good hydration to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, particularly in poorer soils.
