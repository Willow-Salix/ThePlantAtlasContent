## Care Guide
This tropical fern thrives in high humidity and consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native forest understory habitat. Provide low to medium indirect light and fertilize sparingly with a diluted solution during its active growth phase.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. Apply a diluted (e.g., half-strength) balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 months during the active growing season (spring and summer).
