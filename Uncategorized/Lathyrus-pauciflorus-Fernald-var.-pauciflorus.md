## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including the Pacific Northwest (e.g., Oregon, Washington, British Columbia) and Rocky Mountain states (e.g., Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Forest and Subalpine Meadows. Experiences distinct seasons with moderate rainfall, and can tolerate dry summers. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun for optimal flowering and growth, but can tolerate partial shade, especially in hotter climates. It's typically found in open areas rather than dense understory. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering. The soil should be kept consistently moist but well-drained, especially during the growing season. It can tolerate some drought once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry summer periods in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Lathyrus  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae, and contains approximately 160 species. Commonly known as peavines or vetchlings, they are native to temperate areas, with a breakdown of 52 species in Europe, 30 species in North America, 78 in Asia, 24 in tropical East Africa, and 24 in temperate South America. There are annual and perennial species which may be climbing or bushy.  This genus has numerous sections, including Orobus, which was once a separate genus. The genus has numerous synonyms, including Pisum, the ancient Latin name for the pea.

## Care Guide
This temperate native thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions. Being a nitrogen-fixing legume, it needs minimal fertilization, preferring average soil conditions. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so heavy nitrogen fertilization is not required. A balanced, low-strength fertilizer can be applied once a year in spring if soil appears poor, but generally, it thrives in average soils without much supplemental feeding.
