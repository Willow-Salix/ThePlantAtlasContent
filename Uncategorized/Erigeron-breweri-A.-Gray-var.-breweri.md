## Care Guide
Brewer's Fleabane thrives in conditions mimicking its native montane habitat, preferring full sun to partial shade and excellent drainage. Water moderately during its growing season, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications, as it is drought-tolerant once established. Avoid excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Thrives in lean to average, well-draining soils.
