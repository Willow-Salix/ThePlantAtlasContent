## Care Guide
Siberian springbeauty thrives in the cool, moist, and shady environment of a temperate forest understory. It requires consistently moist, organically rich, and well-draining soil, along with protection from intense afternoon sun. Provide light, organic fertilization in early spring to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding. A thin layer of compost or a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer applied in early spring is generally sufficient. Avoid heavy fertilization.
