## 🧤 Care Instructions
Naked Milkvetch thrives in full sun and well-draining, arid conditions, mirroring its native Western US desert habitat. Water sparingly and deeply, ensuring the soil dries out completely between sessions to prevent root rot. Minimal to no fertilization is necessary, especially avoiding high-nitrogen products.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required once established. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
