## Care Guide
Hairy Senna is a resilient tropical/subtropical plant that prefers full to partial sun, mimicking its open habitat. It thrives with moderate watering during its growth cycle, adapting well to periods of dryness. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it requires minimal fertilizer, making it a relatively low-maintenance option.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the growing season if soil is poor, otherwise minimal or none.
