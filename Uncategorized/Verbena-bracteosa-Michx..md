Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants.

## Care Guide
This adaptable plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring moderate watering during active growth but tolerating periods of drought. Minimal fertilization is needed, making it a low-maintenance choice for open, naturalized garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Low. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it naturally grows in disturbed or less fertile soils. Excessive fertilizer can lead to leggy growth.
