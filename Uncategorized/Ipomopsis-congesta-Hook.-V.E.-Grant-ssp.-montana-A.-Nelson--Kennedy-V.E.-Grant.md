## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains and Intermountain West states including Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon) |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid Montane (e.g., Pinyon-Juniper woodlands, sagebrush steppe, montane grasslands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (requires direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day due to open, exposed native habitats) |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering (adapted to drought conditions; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking natural rainfall and snowmelt patterns) |

## Introduction
Ipomopsis is a genus of flowering plants in the phlox family, Polemoniaceae. The annual and perennial herbs it contains are native to the Americas, particularly North America.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, preferring to dry out between deep soaks. It is well-suited for lean, well-draining soils and generally does not require fertilization, mimicking its natural semi-arid montane environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to none (thrives in lean, well-draining, rocky soils characteristic of its native habitat; excessive fertilizer can be detrimental)
