## Introduction
Hypericum  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Hypericaceae (formerly considered a subfamily of Clusiaceae).  The genus has a nearly worldwide distribution, missing only from tropical lowlands, deserts and polar regions. Many Hypericum species are regarded as invasive species and noxious weeds.  All members of the genus may be referred to as St. John's wort, and some are known as goatweed. The white or pink flowered marsh St. John's worts of North America and eastern Asia are generally accepted as belonging to the separate genus Triadenum Raf.
Hypericum is unusual for a genus of its size because a worldwide taxonomic monograph was produced for it by Norman Robson (working at the Natural History Museum, London). Robson recognizes 36 sections within Hypericum.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade, mirroring its preference for woodland edges and open areas in its native range. It requires consistently moist soil, particularly during active growth, but avoids waterlogging. Generally low maintenance, it benefits from occasional light fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder; a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer can be applied annually in spring, especially in poor soils.
