## Care Guide
Tropical Fanleaf thrives in bright conditions, ideally full sun to partial shade, and prefers regular watering during its active growth, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. It requires moderate fertilization and can tolerate some drought once established, making it a relatively resilient plant.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, benefiting from a balanced all-purpose fertilizer applied during its active growing period in spring and summer. Not a heavy feeder, consistent with its ability to grow in disturbed soils.
