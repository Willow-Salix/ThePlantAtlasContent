## Care Guide
Fiddlewood thrives in subtropical dry forest conditions, requiring full sun for robust growth. It is adaptable to drought once established but benefits from regular watering during dry spells. Fertilizer needs are minimal, suitable for average to poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring, especially in nutrient-poor soils, but is often not strictly necessary.
