## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed environments. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent; highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry completely between waterings, mimicking its adaptation to natural arid rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and very dry conditions, requiring minimal water once established. It prefers lean, well-draining soil and does not need frequent fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for arid gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in lean, rocky, or clay soils with poor nutrient content. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
