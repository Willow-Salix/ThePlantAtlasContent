## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, nutrient-poor soil, mimicking its native dry, rocky chaparral habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and very little fertilization to thrive.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very diluted, balanced fertilizer in spring.
