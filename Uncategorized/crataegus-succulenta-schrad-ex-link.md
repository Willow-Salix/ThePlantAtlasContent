## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fleshy Hawthorn is a resilient plant from temperate forests, requiring full sun to partial shade and moderate, consistent watering, especially when establishing. It is not a heavy feeder and generally thrives with minimal fertilization in good soil, becoming quite self-sufficient once mature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not heavy feeders. A balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost application in early spring can support growth, especially in poor soils.
