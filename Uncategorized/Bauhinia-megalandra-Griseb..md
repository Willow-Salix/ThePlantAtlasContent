| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Cuba, Bahamas |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet and Dry (Savanna/Monsoon) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sun per day for best flowering) |
| **Watering** | Regular watering during warm growing months, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Tolerant of brief dry spells, mimicking its native wet and dry seasons. Reduce watering during cooler, dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Bauhinia () is a large genus of flowering plants in the subfamily Cercidoideae and tribe Bauhinieae, in the large flowering plant family Fabaceae, with a pantropical distribution. The genus was named after the Bauhin brothers Gaspard and Johann, Swiss-French botanists.
Many species are widely planted in the tropics as orchid trees, particularly in India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Nepal and south-eastern China. Other common names include mountain ebony and kachnar.  Before the family was reorganised, a number of genera including the lianas of genus Phanera were placed here (see related genera).
In the United States, the trees grow in Hawaii, coastal California, Arizona, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. There are native species, like Bauhinia lunarioides native to Texas and widely planted in the Southwest as a landscape plant.
Parts of some species of bauhinia like B. purpurea and B. malabarica are used in Filipino cuisine (known collectively as alinbánban or alinbángbang, "butterfly").
Bauhinia × blakeana is the floral emblem of Hong Kong—a stylized orchid tree flower appears on the flag of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Airlines (formerly CR Airways) uses 'Bauhinia' as its radio callsign in air traffic communication.

## Care Guide
This tropical tree thrives in full to partial sun, reflecting its native Caribbean habitat. It requires regular watering during its active growth, tolerating brief periods of dryness between waterings. Provide moderate fertilization to support healthy growth and prolific flowering.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength during the active growing season (spring through summer).
