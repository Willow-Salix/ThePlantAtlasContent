## Care Guide
This adaptable temperate grass thrives in partial sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It can tolerate some drought and full sun with sufficient moisture. Minimal fertilization is typically needed, making it a low-maintenance choice for various garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not a heavy feeder. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring may be beneficial but is often not necessary.
