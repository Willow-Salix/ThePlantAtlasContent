## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Littleleaf Hawthorn thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native habitat in pine barrens and open woodlands. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between waterings, and fertilize sparingly as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils, requiring minimal to no supplemental fertilizer.
