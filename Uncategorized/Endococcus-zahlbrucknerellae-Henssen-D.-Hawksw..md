# Endococcus zahlbrucknerellae

*Endococcus zahlbrucknerellae (Henssen) D. Hawksw.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic-alpine regions and cool temperate montane areas across the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., Europe, North America), found on host lichens like Zahlbrucknerella calcarea. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High direct sun exposure, tolerant of strong UV radiation, as typically found in exposed, treeless montane or arctic environments. Requires very bright, unobstructed light. |
| **Watering** | Intermittent moisture from precipitation (rain, snowmelt, fog) followed by periods of drying. Requires high humidity when active, but cannot tolerate prolonged saturation; extremely well-drained, often rocky substrates are essential. |

## Introduction
Endococcus is a genus of lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) in the family Lichenotheliaceae. It has 44 species. The genus was circumscribed by the Finnish botanist William Nylander in 1855. Although at least one source places the genus in the Verrucariaceae, a 2016 study of the type species, Endococcus rugulosus, determined that it should instead be placed in the family Lichenotheliaceae of the order Dothideales; this classification echoes a placement proposed in 1979 by David Hawksworth.

## Care Guide
Cultivating this lichenicolous fungus, or its host lichen, is exceptionally challenging outside its natural habitat and generally not recommended for home growers. It requires a cold, highly exposed environment with intermittent moisture, pristine air, and nutrient-poor conditions. Mimicking its arctic-alpine native climate and its specific host relationship is crucial for any attempt at cultivation.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens and lichenicolous fungi are highly sensitive to nutrient pollution and thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Fertilization would likely be detrimental.
