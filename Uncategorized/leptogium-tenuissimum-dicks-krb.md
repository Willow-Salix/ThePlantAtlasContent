| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across the Northern Hemisphere, including North America (USA, Canada), Europe (e.g., UK, Scandinavia), and parts of Asia (e.g., Japan) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Moist/Humid Biome (e.g., Temperate Forest understory, moist rock outcrops, or grasslands with consistent moisture) |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial Shade to Dappled Sunlight. Avoid direct, intense sun, which can cause desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high humidity and regular moisture from rainfall, dew, or mist. It absorbs water directly from the atmosphere and substrate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Leptogium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Collemataceae. It has about 110 species. Species formerly classified under Leptogium have since been divided among the genera Leptogium, Pseudoleptogium, and Scytinium. Leptogium lichens are predominantly found on tree bark or soil, often among mosses, and sometimes on rocks in moist environments.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This skin lichen thrives in cool, consistently moist, and highly humid environments with partial to dappled sunlight. It relies entirely on atmospheric moisture and nutrients, so traditional fertilizers are harmful. Mimicking its natural temperate habitat with high humidity is key.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None required. Lichens are highly sensitive to mineral salts and traditional fertilizers, which can be detrimental to their health. They obtain nutrients from air and rainfall.
