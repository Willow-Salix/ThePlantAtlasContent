## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cold, exposed, high-altitude or arctic environments on rocks. It requires high light exposure and absorbs water and nutrients directly from the air and substrate, experiencing natural cycles of wetness and dryness.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required; obtains nutrients from atmospheric deposition and minerals from the rock substrate.
