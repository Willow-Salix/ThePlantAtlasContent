## Care Guide
The Cascade Aster thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions, mimicking its native subalpine meadows. Provide regular but moderate watering, ensuring the soil dries slightly between sessions. Fertilize sparingly to maintain its natural, compact growth habit.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It does not require heavy fertilization; excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
