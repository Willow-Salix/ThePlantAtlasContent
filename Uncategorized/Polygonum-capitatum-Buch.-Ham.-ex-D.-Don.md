## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Himalayan region (e.g., Nepal, Bhutan, India, China) and parts of Southeast Asia |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Montane/Highland (often with distinct wet and dry seasons, found in open, disturbed areas) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it thrives in open slopes, forest edges, and disturbed ground. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during warmer months. Its native habitat receives ample rainfall. |

## Introduction
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## Care Guide
Pinkhead Smartweed thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native montane habitat with good rainfall. It requires only light fertilization during its active growth period, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient during the growing season; it is not demanding of rich soils and can thrive in average conditions.
