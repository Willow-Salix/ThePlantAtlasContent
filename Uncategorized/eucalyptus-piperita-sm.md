## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern Australia, specifically the Sydney Basin and Blue Mountains region of New South Wales. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it typically grows in open forest and woodland environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering is crucial for establishment; once mature, it is drought-tolerant and requires minimal supplemental watering, thriving in well-drained conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Australian native thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, adapting well to moderate rainfall patterns. Once established, it is notably drought-tolerant and prefers minimal to no fertilization, especially avoiding high phosphorus due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally requires no fertilizer. If needed for struggling young plants, use a very low-phosphorus native plant formula sparingly, as eucalypts are sensitive to high phosphorus levels.
