## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America, primarily Mexico |
| **Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Dry Forest/Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) reflecting their open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture; water regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Avoid waterlogging, which is uncommon in their native, well-drained environments. |

## Introduction
The cayenne pepper is a type of Capsicum annuum. It is usually a hot chili pepper used to flavor dishes. Cayenne peppers are a group of tapering, 10 to 25 cm long, generally skinny, mostly red-colored peppers, often with a curved tip and somewhat rippled skin, which hang from the bush as opposed to growing upright. Most varieties are generally rated at 30,000 to 50,000 Scoville units.
The fruits are generally dried and ground to make the powdered spice of the same name. However, cayenne powder may be a blend of different types of peppers, quite often not containing cayenne peppers, and may or may not contain the seeds.
Cayenne is used in cooking spicy dishes either as a powder or in its whole form. It is also used as an herbal supplement.

## Care Guide
Cayenne peppers thrive in warm, sunny conditions mimicking their native tropical and subtropical origins. Provide consistent moisture without waterlogging and enrich the soil with nutrients, particularly during their productive fruiting phase, to ensure a bountiful harvest.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high; benefits from nutrient-rich soil and regular feeding, particularly during flowering and fruiting periods, as they are productive plants.
