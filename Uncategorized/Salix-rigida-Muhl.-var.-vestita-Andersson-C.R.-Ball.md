## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
Hairy Willow thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native riparian habitat. It prefers fertile soil and can tolerate periods of inundation, making it ideal for wet areas in temperate gardens or naturalized landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to High; prefers fertile, organically rich soil
