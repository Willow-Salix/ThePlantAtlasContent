## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, United States |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean with Vernal Pool habitats |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright, direct light for most of the day, typical of open grasslands and vernal pools. |
| **Watering** | Heavy watering during its active growth period in late winter and spring, mimicking vernal pool inundation. Allow soil to dry completely and maintain a dry dormant state throughout the hot summer and fall. |

## Introduction
Navarretia is a genus of flowering plants related to the phloxes and the gilias. This is one genus of plants, among others, which are sometimes called pincushion plants. It includes 45 species native to the Americas. In North America they range from western Canada through the western and west-central United States to northwestern Mexico, and to Ohio and Pennsylvania. In South America they range through Argentina and Chile.
The inflorescence which bears the flowers is surrounded by frilly green bracts bearing soft spines, giving it the appearance of a pincushion. Several species are members of the vernal pool ecosystem.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun, requiring intense watering during its active growth in late winter and spring, followed by a complete dry dormancy in summer and fall. It prefers lean soils and needs minimal to no fertilizer, replicating its native vernal pool and grassland conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native to areas with lean and sometimes poor soils, rich fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful.
