## Care Guide
This plant thrives in perpetually moist to wet conditions with full to partial sun, reflecting its natural habitat in Californian wetlands. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires minimal fertilization. The primary focus for care should be maintaining consistent soil moisture.
