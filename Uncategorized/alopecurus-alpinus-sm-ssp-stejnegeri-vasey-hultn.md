## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal regions of Alaska, Aleutian Islands, Kamchatka Peninsula, and Kuril Islands |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subarctic Maritime Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure, tolerant of cool, bright conditions prevalent in open tundra environments. Avoid intense heat. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native boggy or damp tundra habitats with frequent precipitation or meltwater. Avoid drying out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Alopecurus, or foxtail grass, is a common and widespread genus of plants in the grass family. It is common across temperate and subtropical parts of Eurasia, northern Africa, and the Americas, as well as naturalized in Australia and on various islands.
Foxtails can be annual or perennial. They grow in tufts. They have flat leaves and blunt ligules (a small flap at the junction of leaf and stem). Their inflorescence is a dense panicle (a branching head without terminal flower) with 1-flowered spikelets. A few, particularly A. myosuroides, are considered weeds, others are very decorative and are used in bouquets of dried flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stejneger's Foxtail is a hardy subarctic grass requiring consistently wet, well-drained soil and full sun exposure. It thrives in cool temperatures and low-nutrient environments, making over-fertilization detrimental. Ensure constant moisture without waterlogging to mimic its natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor; use a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly, or only if growth shows signs of deficiency.
