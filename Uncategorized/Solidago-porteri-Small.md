## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
Porter's goldenrod thrives in temperate climates, preferring full to partial sun and very well-drained, dry soil conditions. It is highly drought tolerant once established, requiring minimal supplemental water. Fertilizer needs are low, as rich soils can cause excessive growth and flopping.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally not required in average to poor soil. Excessive fertilizer can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
