## Care Guide
To care for the Dominican Staggerbush, provide bright, indirect light and maintain consistently moist, well-drained, acidic soil. Emulate its native montane environment with high humidity and regular watering, while fertilizing sparingly with an acid-forming product.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, acid-forming fertilizer during the growing season (spring/summer), perhaps once or twice a year at half strength, as Ericaceae often prefer leaner, acidic soils.
