## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia, particularly in temperate and subarctic regions. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forest (humid understory and riparian zones) |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade; direct, intense sun should be avoided as it can dry out the moss. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist substrate and high atmospheric humidity are crucial; the moss should never be allowed to dry out completely. Regular misting or placement in a terrarium is beneficial. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in environments mimicking its native riparian habitats, requiring consistently moist conditions and high humidity. It prefers low to partial light and needs minimal nutrients, so avoid over-fertilization. The key is a constantly damp, but not waterlogged, substrate.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. Mosses obtain sufficient nutrients from water and air; excess fertilizer can be detrimental.
