## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
The Cutleaf Hawthorn thrives in full to partial sun and prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil, typical of its native humid subtropical environment. Water regularly, especially when young, and provide light fertilization in spring to support its growth. Once established, it is relatively drought-tolerant.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, especially for young or nutrient-deficient plants. Established plants in good soil may need minimal to no fertilization.
