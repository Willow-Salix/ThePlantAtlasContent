## Introduction
Lysimachia ( LY-sim-AY-kee-ə) is a genus consisting of 182 accepted species of flowering plants traditionally classified in the family Primulaceae. Based on a molecular phylogenetic study it was transferred to the family Myrsinaceae, before this family was later merged into the Primulaceae.

## Care Guide
This species thrives in very wet conditions, requiring consistently moist to saturated soil, even tolerating standing water for periods. It performs best in full to partial sun and needs only light fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor, sandy native habitats.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization, as its native pineland soils are typically nutrient-poor. An annual light application of balanced fertilizer is usually sufficient.
