## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This crustose lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions on siliceous rocks. It requires infrequent moisture from atmospheric sources, tolerating significant dry periods. No traditional fertilization is needed, as it obtains all necessary nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens absorb all necessary nutrients directly from the air and the substrate. Traditional fertilizers are detrimental and should be avoided.
