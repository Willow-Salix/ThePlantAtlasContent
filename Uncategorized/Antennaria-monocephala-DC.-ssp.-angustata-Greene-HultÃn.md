## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions of North America, including Alaska and northern Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to high light exposure, as it grows in open, treeless tundra environments with direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low, requiring excellent drainage. It is adapted to moisture from snowmelt in spring, but tolerates periods of dryness in often rocky, well-drained soils. |

## Introduction
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## Care Guide
Pygmy Pussytoes thrives in full sun with high light exposure, mirroring its open alpine tundra habitat. It requires well-drained soil and moderate to low watering, adapting to cold conditions and periods of dryness. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is accustomed to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low, as it naturally inhabits nutrient-poor, thin, and often rocky soils characteristic of alpine and arctic tundra.
