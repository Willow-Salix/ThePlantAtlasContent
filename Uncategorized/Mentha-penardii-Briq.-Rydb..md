## Introduction
Mentha, also known as mint (from Greek μίνθα míntha, Linear B mi-ta), is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is estimated that 13 to 24 species exist, but the exact distinction between species is unclear. Hybridization occurs naturally where some species' ranges overlap. Many hybrids and cultivars are known.
The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution, growing best in wet environments and moist soils.

## Care Guide
Penard's Mint thrives with ample sunlight to partial shade and requires consistently moist soil, replicating its natural riparian environment. Fertilization needs are minimal, preferring a balanced approach or soil enriched with organic matter. Ensure consistent moisture to mimic its native wet meadow habitat.

### Fertilizer
Not a heavy feeder; a light application of balanced, all-purpose fertilizer or the incorporation of rich organic matter into the soil is sufficient, applied sparingly.
