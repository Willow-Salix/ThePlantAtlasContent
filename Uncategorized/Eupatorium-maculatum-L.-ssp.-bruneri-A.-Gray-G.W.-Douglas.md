## Introduction
Eupatorium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, containing from 36 to 60 species depending on the classification system. Most are herbaceous perennials growing to 0.5–3 m (1.6–9.8 ft) tall. A few are shrubs. The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The type species of the genus Eupatorium cannabinum, which is also the sole European species, is known as hemp-agrimony. Most in North America are commonly called boneset, thoroughwort or snakeroot. The genus is named after Mithridates VI Eupator, king of Pontus.
