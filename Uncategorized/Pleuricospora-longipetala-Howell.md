## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia) |
| **Climate** | Moist Temperate Coniferous Forest Understory |
| **Sunlight** | No direct sun; thrives in deep to partial shade characteristic of a dense forest floor. As a mycoheterotroph, it does not photosynthesize and direct light is unnecessary. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, but well-drained soil rich in organic matter, mimicking the damp conditions of its forest habitat. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Pleuricospora is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae containing the single species Pleuricospora fimbriolata, which is known by the common name fringed pinesap. It is native to the forests of the west coast of North America from British Columbia to the San Francisco Bay Area. This perennial herb is a mycoheterotroph, parasitizing fungi for nutrients. It is yellowish, cream or white in color, lacking chlorophyll, with the tips of the bracts darkening with age. It produces a fleshy stemless peduncle above the leaf litter of the forest floor, reaching no more than 10 to 12 centimeters tall. Leaves are reduced to scales or absent, as the plant does not perform photosynthesis. The aboveground portion of the plant is essentially just inflorescence, with cylindrical whitish flowers blooming for a short time. The flower has four or five petals and about eight stamens in its throat. It produces a fleshy berry under a centimeter wide containing many tiny, sticky seeds. The seeds are dispersed when small mammals eat the fruits.

## Care Guide
The Ghost Plant is a unique mycoheterotroph, making it extremely difficult to cultivate outside its natural environment. It requires deep shade, consistently moist, well-drained soil rich in specific organic matter, and the presence of its symbiotic fungal and host tree network. Traditional gardening care, including direct fertilization, is not applicable.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable for traditional fertilization. This plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it obtains all nutrients indirectly from fungi associated with host trees, rather than directly from soil or applied fertilizers. Attempting to fertilize conventionally is ineffective and likely detrimental.
