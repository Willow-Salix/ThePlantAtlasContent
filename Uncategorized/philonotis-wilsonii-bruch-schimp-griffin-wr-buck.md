## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, mimicking its native bog and fen habitats. It prefers partial to full shade and requires very little, if any, fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Mosses are adapted to nutrient-poor environments, deriving most nutrients from water and decaying organic matter; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
