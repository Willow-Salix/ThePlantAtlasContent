## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically California, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah in the United States) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland to Semi-arid Grassland/Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for optimal growth, mimicking its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.

## Care Guide
Eastwood's Desertparsley thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, preferring dry conditions typical of its native arid scrublands. It is well-suited for xeriscaping or rock gardens in lean, well-draining soil with very little to no supplemental fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. If grown in containers, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring. In-ground plants typically require no additional fertilization.
