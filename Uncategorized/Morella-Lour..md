| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Southeastern North America (United States, Canada, Caribbean islands) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Forest/Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in brighter environments found in open woodlands and coastal areas. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to keep soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged; established plants are moderately drought-tolerant, reflecting their adaptability in varying native conditions. |

## Introduction
Myrica  is a genus of about 35–50 species of small trees and shrubs in the family Myricaceae, order Fagales. The genus has a wide distribution, including Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America, and missing only from Antarctica and Oceania. Some botanists split the genus into two genera on the basis of the catkin and fruit structure, restricting Myrica to a few species, and treating the others in Morella.
Common names include bayberry, bay-rum tree, candleberry, sweet gale, and wax-myrtle. The generic name was derived from the Greek word μυρίκη (myrike), meaning "fragrance".

## Care Guide
Bayberry thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, though established plants show moderate drought tolerance. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires minimal to no fertilization, preferring lean soil conditions characteristic of its native environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, as many species are nitrogen-fixing and thrive in lean, naturally occurring soils of their native habitats.
