## Care Guide
Arthonia subfusicola thrives in cool, highly humid environments with consistent moisture and indirect light. Mimic its native cool-temperate rainforest conditions by providing high ambient humidity and regular misting, while strictly avoiding direct sunlight and any form of fertilization.

### Fertilizer
