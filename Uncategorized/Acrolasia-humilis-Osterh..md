## Care Guide
This orchid requires a cool, moist environment with dappled light, reflecting its native montane forest habitat. Ensure the soil remains consistently moist but not waterlogged, and provide infrequent, light fertilization during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced orchid-specific fertilizer during active growth (e.g., once a month at half strength). Reduce or cease feeding during dormancy.
