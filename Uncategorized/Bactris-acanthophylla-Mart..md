## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical South America, including Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to filtered sun, avoiding intense direct midday light. Mimics the understory or dappled light conditions of its native rainforest habitat. |
| **Watering** | Maintain consistently moist soil, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Water frequently, especially during warm periods, and ensure high ambient humidity, as it originates from a high rainfall environment. |

## Introduction
Bactris is a genus of spiny palms which are native to Mexico, South and Central America and the Caribbean. Most species are small trees about 2 m (6 ft 7 in) tall, but some are large trees while others are shrubs with subterranean stems. They have simple or pinnately compound leaves and yellow, orange, red or purple-black fruit. The genus is most closely related to several other spiny palms—Acrocomia, Aiphanes, Astrocaryum and Desmoncus. The fruit of several species is edible, most notably B. gasipaes, while others are used medicinally or for construction.
The ancestors of the genus are believed to have entered South America during the late Cretaceous. Bactris shows high rates of speciation.

## Care Guide
This tropical palm thrives in conditions mimicking its native Amazonian rainforest habitat. Provide partial shade to filtered sun, maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, and ensure high ambient humidity. Fertilize moderately during the growing season with a balanced palm-specific formula.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring to summer) with a balanced slow-release fertilizer formulated for palms or general tropical plants. Reduce feeding in colder months.
