| **Climate** | Temperate grasslands, open fields, and cultivated land margins, including Mediterranean climates with dry summers and wet winters. |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun to partial shade; in its native habitat, it typically grows in open, exposed areas, suggesting a preference for at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. |

## Care Guide
Adonis L. flourishes in temperate environments with ample sunlight and well-drained soil. Maintain consistent moisture during its spring growth phase, and provide a moderate feeding to support its vibrant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in moderately fertile soil. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is beneficial, especially if planted in poor or sandy soils, as found in many disturbed native habitats.
