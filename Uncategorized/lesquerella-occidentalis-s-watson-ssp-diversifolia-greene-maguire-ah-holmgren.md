## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains and intermountain regions of USA and Canada, including Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, British Columbia, Alberta) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to semi-arid Montane/Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, high-altitude habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Low; drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings, mimicking its native dry conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lesquerella is the former name of a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Recent work has shown that Lesquerella is indistinct from the genus Physaria and both genera have been united under Physaria. In addition, the former Lesquerella of the southeastern United States have been moved to the genus Paysonia since 2002. The genus Lesquerella is now no longer applied to any species and is considered defunct.
The genus is named in honor of Leo Lesquereux, 1805–1889, Swiss and American botanist.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native arid montane habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering and fertilization once established, making it an excellent low-maintenance option for xeric gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils common in its native range. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
