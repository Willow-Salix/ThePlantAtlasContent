## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in environments with high atmospheric humidity and consistent moisture, typically found in shaded to partially shaded locations within temperate or subtropical forests. It relies on ambient air and rain for nutrients and water, making traditional watering or fertilizing unsuitable. It is sensitive to air pollution.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional soil-based fertilizers. Obtains all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and its substrate; highly sensitive to air pollution.
