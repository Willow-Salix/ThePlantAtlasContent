| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widely distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe (e.g., British Isles, Western Europe) and North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Appalachian Mountains). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest, often found in humid, sheltered microclimates within these forests. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light; requires protection from direct sunlight, thriving in dappled shade or full shade conditions found under a forest canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and regular moisture, typically from rainfall and mist. Substrate should be moist but never waterlogged. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecanactis is a genus of crustose lichens, commonly called old wood lichens. The mycobiont (fungus partner) is in the family Roccellaceae. The photobiont is an algae in the genus Trentepohlia. These lichens typically grow as thin crusts on tree bark or rocks, producing small black fruiting bodies that may appear as round discs or elongated slits. The genus contains about 20 species found worldwide, with some species considered rare and threatened by habitat loss.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its temperate forest habitat, requiring high atmospheric humidity and protection from direct sun. Ensure regular moisture through misting while avoiding waterlogging the substrate, and refrain from using any traditional fertilizers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens are highly sensitive to traditional fertilizers and derive nutrients primarily from the air and rain. Fertilization can be harmful.
