## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States, including states from Maryland south to Florida and west to Texas and Oklahoma. |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (specifically dry woodlands, clearings, and open fields within this biome) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full sun. Prefers dappled light or morning sun, but can tolerate more direct sun, especially in cooler climates or with consistent moisture. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Allow the top soil to dry out between waterings. Avoid overwatering, as it prefers the well-drained conditions characteristic of its native dry woodlands. |

## Introduction
Aureolaria, with the common name false foxgloves, is a genus of 8 species, native to North America.
Aureolaria plants are hemiparasitic, which is a character that in part describes the family Orobanchaceae.
Until recently the genus was aligned with members of the family Scrophulariaceae.  As a result of numerous molecular phylogenetic studies based on various chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) loci, it was shown to be more closely related to members of the Orobanchaceae.

## Care Guide
This hemiparasitic plant thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native dry woodland habitat in the southeastern US. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between applications, and avoid excessive fertilization due to its unique nutrient acquisition strategy from host plants.

### Fertilizer
Low. As a hemiparasite, it obtains a significant portion of its nutrients from host plants (typically oaks). Supplemental fertilization is rarely necessary and should be very diluted if applied.
