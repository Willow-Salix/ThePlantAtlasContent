## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South America, primarily Brazil (found across biomes like Amazonia, Cerrado, Caatinga, and Atlantic Forest) |
| **Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Dry Forest and Savanna/Cerrado |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial sun, thriving in bright, direct light exposure typical of open forest edges or savannas. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular and consistent watering during its active growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry out slightly between waterings. Tolerant of short dry periods once established, reflecting its adaptation to regions with distinct wet and dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Byrsonima is one of about 75 genera in the Malpighiaceae, a family of flowering plants in the order Malpighiales. In particular in American English, they are known as locustberries (which also may refer specifically to Byrsonima coccolobifolia or Byrsonima lucida). Another widely seen common name is serrets or serrettes.

Byrsonima comprises over 135 species of trees, shrubs, and subshrubs found in the New World tropics and subtropics from southern Mexico, southeastern Florida, and the Caribbean to southeastern Brazil. The plants have entire leaves, yellow flowers, and fleshy, edible fruits called nance; B. crassifolia in particular is known by that name, as it is an underutilized crop of some commercial importance in Latin America. They are primarily pollinated by various oligolectic native bees (e.g., Centris, Epicharis, and Tetrapedia) that are specialized to collect floral oils, as the flowers do not offer the typical floral rewards.
The fruits of serrette trees are important in the diets of certain wildlife, such as the golden conure (Guaruba guarouba), while the leaves of Byrsonima are food for some of the curious American moth-butterflies (Hedylidae). Plantings of B. crassifolia in the dry savannas of Oaxaca may even be suitable as substitute habitat for the Tehuantepec jackrabbit (Lepus flavigularis), an endangered species presently only found in three small relict populations.
Maricao (B. spicata) is the namesake tree and floral emblem of Maricao, Puerto Rico, and figured on the coat of arms of this city.

## Care Guide
This resilient tropical-subtropical plant flourishes in bright, direct light conditions. It needs regular watering, allowing for slight drying between applications, and tolerates brief dry spells. Provide a balanced fertilizer during its growing period for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer applied moderately during the growing season (spring and summer), typically every 2-4 weeks. Native soils can vary, but a moderate nutrient supply supports vigorous growth.
