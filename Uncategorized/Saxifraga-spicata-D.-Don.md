## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
Spiked Saxifrage thrives in cool, high-altitude environments, needing full sun to partial shade and consistently moist but extremely well-drained soil to mimic its alpine habitat. Provide minimal fertilizer and ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot, which is crucial for its survival.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring is sufficient, or none if grown in naturally fertile soil.
