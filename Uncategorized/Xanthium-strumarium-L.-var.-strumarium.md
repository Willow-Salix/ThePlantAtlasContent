## Introduction
Xanthium strumarium (rough cocklebur, Noogoora burr, clotbur, common cocklebur, large cocklebur, woolgarie bur) is a species of annual plants in the flowering plant family Asteraceae. Some sources claim it originates in southern Europe and Asia, but has been extensively naturalized elsewhere. Others, such as the Flora of China and Flora of North America, state it originates in the Americas but was an early introduction to Eurasia.

## Care Guide
Rough Cocklebur is a resilient plant thriving in full sun and consistently moist soil, typical of its native disturbed and riparian habitats in North America. It requires minimal fertilization due to its weedy nature, making it a low-maintenance species in appropriate conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied annually if soil nutrients are very poor, but generally not a high-demand plant.
