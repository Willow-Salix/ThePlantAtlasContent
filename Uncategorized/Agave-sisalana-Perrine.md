| **🌍 Origin** | Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-Arid Tropical Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Overwatering can lead to root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sisal (, Spanish: [siˈsal]; Agave sisalana) is a species of flowering plant native to southern Mexico, but widely cultivated and naturalized in many other countries. It yields a stiff fibre used in making rope and various other products. The sisal fiber is traditionally used for rope and twine, and has many other uses, including cloth, footwear, hats, bags, carpets, geotextiles, and dartboards. It is also used as fiber reinforcements for composite fiberglass, rubber, and concrete products. Like other agaves, the pith of the leaves can be fermented and distilled to make mezcal.
Sisal has an uncertain native origin, but is thought to have originated in the Mexican state of Chiapas. Sisal plants have a lifespan of 7–10 years, producing 200–250 usable leaves containing fibers used in various applications. Sisal is a tropical and subtropical plant, thriving in temperatures above 25 °C (77 °F) and sunshine.
Historically, sisal was used by the Aztecs and Maya for a crude fabric. It spread to other parts of the world in the 19th century, with Brazil becoming the major producer. Sisal is propagated using bulbils or suckers and can be improved genetically through tissue culture. Fibers are extracted through decortication and then dried, brushed, and baled for export.
Sisal farming initially led to environmental degradation, but it is now considered less damaging than other farming types. It is an invasive species in Hawaii and Florida.
Global sisal production in 2020 was 210,000 tons, with Brazil being the largest producer, followed by Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar, China, and Mexico.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sisal hemp is a resilient plant best suited for arid conditions, requiring full sun and very infrequent watering to prevent root issues. It thrives in well-draining soil and is a low-maintenance choice that does not typically demand regular fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; a balanced, diluted fertilizer can be applied once a year during the growing season, but it often thrives without any added nutrients.
