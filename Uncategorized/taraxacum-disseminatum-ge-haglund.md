## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eurasia (Europe and Asia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Meadow (highly adaptable, often found in disturbed habitats) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Shade. Thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight but can tolerate less. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate. Water when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry. Tolerates dry spells once established but prefers consistent moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Taraxacum officinale, the dandelion or common dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. The common dandelion is well-known for its yellow flower heads that turn into round balls of many silver-tufted fruit, which disperse in the wind. These balls are sometimes called "clocks" or "blowballs".
Originally native to Eurasia, as a result of its hardiness and easy propagation, the dandelion has become widely established across several continents. It has been introduced to southern Africa, the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. It grows in temperate regions of the world in areas with moist soils. They are able to grow in a variety of environments and are tolerant of crowding, extreme temperatures, and low moisture.
The dandelion is often considered a weed, especially in lawns, but it is increasingly being recognised in its native regions as useful for attracting birds and pollinating insects. In one study, it ranked as the fourth most important source of pollen. Although dandelion pollen is considered to be an early food resource for some emerging pollinators in spring, it has also been found to lack certain essential nutrients and can lead to declining brood health for bees.
The leaves, flowers, and roots are sometimes used as food and in herbal medicine.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Common Dandelions are extremely adaptable and low-maintenance plants. They prefer full sun to partial shade and moderate watering, thriving in a wide range of soil conditions without requiring special fertilization. Their robust nature allows them to prosper across diverse temperate environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Dandelions are highly resilient and thrive in average to poor soils without the need for heavy fertilization.
