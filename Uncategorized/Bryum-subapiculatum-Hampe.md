## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Cosmopolitan, found across Europe, Asia, North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania, particularly in temperate to subtropical regions. |
| **Climate** | Temperate and Subtropical Moist Climates, often found in disturbed, open habitats rather than a specific natural biome. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to bright indirect light; can tolerate some direct morning sun but avoid intense afternoon sun to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Keep substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged; daily misting or light watering is crucial to maintain surface dampness, as mosses absorb water directly from their surroundings. |

## Introduction
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## Care Guide
Bryum Moss thrives in consistently moist environments with partial shade to bright indirect light, tolerating some morning sun. It prefers disturbed, open ground and has very low nutrient requirements, making over-fertilization detrimental. Ensure constant surface dampness to support its unique water absorption and maintain vigor.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. Mosses are low-nutrient plants and can be harmed by excessive fertilization; use a very diluted, balanced liquid feed sparingly if growth is poor.
