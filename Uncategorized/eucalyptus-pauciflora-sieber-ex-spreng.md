## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern Australia (New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania), particularly alpine and subalpine regions. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine/Subalpine |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in open, exposed high-altitude environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, consistent moisture, especially when young. Once established, it is relatively drought-tolerant but benefits from occasional deep watering during dry spells. Tolerant of snowmelt. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eucalyptus pauciflora, commonly known as snow gum, cabbage gum or white sally, is a species of tree or mallee that is native to eastern Australia. It has smooth bark, lance-shaped to elliptical leaves, flower buds in clusters of between seven and fifteen, white flowers and cup-shaped, conical or hemispherical fruit. It is widespread and locally common in woodland in cold sites above 700 m (2,300 ft) altitude.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in full sun and cool conditions, the Snow Gum requires well-drained soil and moderate, consistent watering, becoming more drought-tolerant once established. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor native soils, fertilization should be minimal and low in phosphorus.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal. These plants are adapted to nutrient-poor soils. If necessary, use a low-phosphorus fertilizer sparingly.
