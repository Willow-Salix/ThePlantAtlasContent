| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight) is ideal, reflecting its open prairie habitat. It can tolerate partial sun but may have reduced flowering. |

## Care Guide
The Hairy Four O'Clock thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native prairie environment. It is very drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering and minimal to no fertilization for robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in average to moderately rich prairie soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization. If soil is very poor, a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
