## Care Guide
This tropical understory plant thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil and high humidity, replicating its native forest floor environment. Provide indirect or dappled light, shielding it from direct sun, and offer regular, moderate fertilization during its growth periods for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during fall and winter.
