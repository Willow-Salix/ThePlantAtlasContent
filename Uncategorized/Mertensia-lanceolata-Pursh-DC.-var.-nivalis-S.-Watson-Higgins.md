## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically alpine and subalpine regions of the Rocky Mountains (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra/Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; in its native high-altitude environment, it receives intense sun but benefits from afternoon shade in warmer, lower-altitude gardens. |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent moisture during its active growth in spring, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Requires excellent drainage, tolerating drier conditions once it enters summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Mertensia is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family Boraginaceae. They are perennial herbaceous plants with blue or sometimes white flowers that open from pink-tinged buds. Such a change in flower color is common in Boraginaceae and is caused by changes in soil pH. Mertensia is one of several plants that are commonly called "bluebell". In spite of their common name, the flowers are usually salverform (trumpet-shaped) rather than campanulate (bell-shaped).
Mertensia is native to most of North America and to a large part of Asia from western China to northeastern Russia. Its center of diversity is in the Rocky Mountains. Mertensia is mostly restricted to alpine, subalpine, and montane habitats. Notable exceptions are Mertensia maritima, a maritime plant of Arctic and subarctic coastlines, and Mertensia virginica, which is found from the Appalachian Mountains west to Minnesota, Iowa, and Missouri. Most of the species are endemic to very small areas of the Rocky Mountains.
Mertensia virginica has the largest flowers in the genus and is commonly cultivated. It is sparingly naturalized in Europe. About 12 other species are known in cultivation. The Inuit ate the rhizomes of Mertensia maritima.
Many of the species of Mertensia are hard to distinguish and some are possibly cryptic. Around 150 species names have been published in Mertensia. Most authors have recognized about 45 species, but in 2014, the authors of a molecular phylogenetic study recommended the acceptance of at least 62.

## Care Guide
This alpine variety thrives in cool, high-altitude environments, preferring full sun to partial shade and excellent drainage. Provide moderate, consistent moisture during spring growth, reducing as it goes dormant. It requires minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to lean, rocky soils.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to lean, well-drained, rocky soils. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer application in early spring is sufficient, or none if the soil is adequately rich.
