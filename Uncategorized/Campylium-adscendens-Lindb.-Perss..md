## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Boreal Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers low to moderate indirect light, thriving in shaded or partially shaded environments. Avoid direct sunlight, which can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist conditions, mimicking its native wetland or damp forest habitat. The substrate should never be allowed to dry out completely, and high humidity is beneficial. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in consistently moist, shaded environments with high humidity, typical of its native temperate boreal wetlands. Keep the substrate damp at all times and protect it from direct sun, while avoiding significant fertilization due to its minimal nutrient requirements.

### Fertilizer
Mosses have very low nutrient needs. Fertilizer is rarely necessary and can be detrimental; if used, apply a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly once or twice a year.
