## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This hybrid willow thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, making it ideal for riparian zones or areas with ample water. It prefers full sun exposure to achieve robust growth. Provide moderate to high fertility to support its vigorous nature.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Benefit from an annual application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially if planted in less fertile soil.
