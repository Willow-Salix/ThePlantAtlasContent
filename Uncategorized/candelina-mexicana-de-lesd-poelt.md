## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in bright, indirect light conditions, mimicking its arid to semi-arid native habitat. Watering should be very infrequent, allowing it to dry out completely between sparse applications and benefiting from ambient humidity. Fertilization is not required, as lichens gather nutrients from the air and substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air, rain, and the surfaces they colonize.
