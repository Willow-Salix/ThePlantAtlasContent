## Introduction
Parthenium is a genus of North American annuals, biennials, perennials, subshrubs, and shrubs in the tribe Heliantheae within the family Asteraceae and subfamily Asteroideae.
The name Parthenium is an evolution of the Ancient Greek name παρθένιον (parthenion), which referred to Tanacetum parthenium. The name is possibly derived from the Greek word παρθένος (parthenos) which means "virgin".
Members of the genus are commonly known as feverfew. Notable species include guayule (P. argentatum) which has been used as a rubber substitute, especially during the Second World War; and also P. hysterophorus, a serious invasive species in the Old World.

## Care Guide
Gray's Feverfew is a resilient plant best suited for dry, sunny environments. Provide full sun exposure and practice infrequent, deep watering, ensuring the soil dries completely. It requires minimal to no fertilizer, thriving in lean, well-draining conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to poor, lean soils and does not require regular fertilization. Excess nutrients can be detrimental.
