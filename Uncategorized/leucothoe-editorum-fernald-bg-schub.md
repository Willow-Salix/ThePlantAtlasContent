## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Appalachian Mountains, from West Virginia south to Georgia and Alabama) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Woodland/Forest (moist, mountainous regions, often in ravines and along stream banks) |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade. It thrives in dappled light or locations protected from intense afternoon sun, similar to an understory plant in a temperate forest. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is essential, especially during dry periods and establishment. The soil should remain evenly moist but well-drained, avoiding waterlogging, reflecting its native habitat of moist, humus-rich forest floors. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pieris floribunda is a North American species of broadleaf evergreen shrub, a member of the fetterbush genus in the blueberry family (Ericaceae). It is commonly known in North America as mountain fetterbush or mountain andromeda. All parts of Pieris floribunda are poisonous if ingested. In landscapes it should be grown in full to part shade, out of windy locations, and have a good quality soil with much organic matter with acidity of pH 4.5 to 6.5.
The mountain fetterbush is less subject to damage from the Azalea lacebug that often infests the related Pieris japonica.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mountain Fetterbush requires a shady spot with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native temperate woodland understory. Protect it from direct, harsh sun and provide ample organic matter to the soil for optimal health. Fertilize sparingly in spring with a balanced, slow-release product.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilizer needs. A single application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or organic compost in early spring is sufficient. Native woodland soils are typically rich in organic matter but not excessively fertile.
