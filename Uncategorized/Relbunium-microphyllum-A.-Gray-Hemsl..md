## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Southern Mexico (high-altitude regions) |
| **Climate** | Montane Temperate Forest (Subhumid Temperate) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. As an understory plant in high-altitude forests, it receives dappled sunlight or brighter light in forest clearings, avoiding intense direct midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Native to areas with distinct wet and dry seasons, it prefers consistently moist soil during its active growing period but can tolerate slight drying between waterings. Avoid waterlogging, especially during drier periods. |

## Introduction
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its montane Mexican habitat: bright indirect light to partial sun and moderate, consistent moisture, allowing slight drying between waterings. It benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growth. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot, especially given its adaptation to distinct wet and dry seasons.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. Forest soils are typically not exceptionally rich but provide steady nutrients. Fertilize with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring/summer) once a month.
