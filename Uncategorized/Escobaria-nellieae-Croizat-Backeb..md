| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Brewster County and Presidio County, West Texas, USA |
| **Climate** | Chihuahuan Desert, Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; requires very bright light for optimal growth but can benefit from some afternoon shade in extreme heat. |
| **Watering** | Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Significantly reduce or cease watering during the winter dormancy period. |

## Introduction
Pelecyphora, pincushion cactus or foxtail cactus is a genus of cacti, comprising 20 species. They originate from Mexico and the United States.
Common species include the Missouri foxtail cactus P. missouriensis, widespread in grassland and forest west of the Mississippi, and the spinystar P. vivipara, distributed across the US and into Canada, first described by Nuttall in 1813.

## Care Guide
This rare cactus thrives in conditions mimicking its native Chihuahuan Desert habitat, requiring full sun and very well-draining soil. It tolerates drought well, needing infrequent watering with almost no water during winter dormancy. Minimal fertilization is sufficient to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. A diluted, balanced succulent/cactus fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer).
