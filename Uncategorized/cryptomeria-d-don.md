## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Japan (specifically mountainous regions), and extensively cultivated in China |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate Forest (Montane) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight for best growth, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture, especially when young; established trees prefer regular watering but can tolerate short dry periods due to their native climate's substantial rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cryptomeria (literally "hidden parts") is a monotypic genus of conifer in the cypress family Cupressaceae. It includes only one species, Cryptomeria japonica (syn.  Cupressus japonica L.f.). It is considered to be endemic to Japan, where it is known as Sugi (杉).  The tree is also called Japanese cedar or Japanese redwood in English. It has been extensively introduced, and cultivated for wood production on the Azores and elsewhere.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Japanese Cedar thrives in conditions mimicking its native humid temperate forest, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Ensure regular watering, particularly during dry spells, and provide moderate fertilization to support its robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding; benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially when young or in nutrient-poor soils.
