## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, acidic, nutrient-poor soils. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established. Avoid over-fertilization and wet conditions to mimic its harsh, exposed native habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Native to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary and can be detrimental; if used, apply very sparingly with an acid-loving plant formula.
