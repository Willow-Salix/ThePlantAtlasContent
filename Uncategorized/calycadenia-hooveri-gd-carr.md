## 🧤 Care Instructions
This annual plant prefers full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. Water moderately during its active spring growth, then reduce significantly as it tolerates summer drought. Minimal fertilization is typically sufficient for healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Thrives in leaner soils; a light, balanced fertilizer might be beneficial during its spring growth but is often not strictly necessary.
