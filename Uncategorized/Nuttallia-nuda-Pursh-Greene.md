# Nude Blazingstar

*Nuttallia nuda (Pursh) Greene* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Western United States (from the Great Plains westward) and parts of southern Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan). |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Temperate Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its native open prairie and dryland habitats. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant, requiring very infrequent watering. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, consistent with its adaptation to arid and semi-arid regions. |

## Introduction
Nuttallia is a genus of saltwater clams, marine bivalve molluscs in the family Psammobiidae.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives on neglect, requiring abundant full sun exposure and very well-draining, lean soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to completely dry between sessions, as it is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to arid conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; this plant thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, perhaps a very light, balanced feed once in spring if growth appears weak.
