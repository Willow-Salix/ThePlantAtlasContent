## 🧤 Care Instructions
Blowout grass thrives in full sun and extremely well-draining, sandy soils, reflecting its native arid grassland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, preferring dry conditions over consistent moisture. Fertilization is generally unnecessary due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils and does not thrive with added nutrients.
