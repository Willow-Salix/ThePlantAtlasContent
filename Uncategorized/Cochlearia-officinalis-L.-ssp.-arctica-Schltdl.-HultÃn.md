## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions of Northern Europe, Asia, and North America (e.g., Greenland, Canada, Alaska) |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra, Subarctic Coastal |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, tolerating the long daylight hours and often exposed conditions of its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil, especially during the short growing season. Tolerant of damp, often saline conditions found near coasts or meltwater. |

## Introduction
Cochlearia (scurvy-grass or spoonwort) is a genus of about 30 species of annual and perennial herbs in the family Brassicaceae. They are widely distributed in temperate and arctic areas of the northern hemisphere, most commonly found in coastal regions, on cliff-tops and salt marshes where their high tolerance of salt enables them to avoid competition from larger, but less salt-tolerant plants; they also occur in alpine habitats in mountains and tundra.
They form low, rounded or creeping plants, typically 5–20 cm tall. The leaves are smoothly rounded, roughly spoon-shaped (the scientific name Cochlearia derives from the Latinized form, cocleare, of the Greek κοχλιάριον, kokhliárion, a spoon; this a diminutive of κόχλος, kókhlos, seashell), or in some species, lobed; typically 1–5 cm long, and with a fleshy texture. The flowers are white with four petals and are borne in short racemes.

## Care Guide
This cold-hardy plant thrives in conditions mimicking its arctic home, requiring full to partial sun exposure. It needs consistently moist, well-drained soil and adapts well to nutrient-poor substrates, making heavy fertilization unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Thrives in nutrient-poor to lean soils typical of tundra environments.
