## Introduction
Potamogeton is a genus of aquatic, mostly freshwater, plants of the family Potamogetonaceae. Most are known by the common name pondweed, although many unrelated plants may be called pondweed, such as Canadian pondweed (Elodea canadensis). The genus name means "river neighbor", originating from the Greek potamos (river) and geiton (neighbor).

## Care Guide
Potamogeton Ã—bottnicus is an aquatic hybrid plant thriving in temperate freshwater environments. It requires continuous submersion in clean water with bright light exposure and moderate nutrient levels to support its growth effectively.

### Fertilizer
Moderate nutrients, typically sourced from the water column and substrate; excessive fertilization should be avoided to prevent algae blooms.
