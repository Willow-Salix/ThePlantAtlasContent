## Care Guide
This alpine perennial thrives in cold, exposed environments, requiring full sun to partial shade and excellent drainage. Provide consistent, moderate moisture but avoid waterlogging, mimicking its native habitat with meltwater and well-drained soils. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum due to its adaptation to lean, rocky substrates.

### Fertilizer
Low (adapted to lean, nutrient-poor, rocky or gravelly soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental).
