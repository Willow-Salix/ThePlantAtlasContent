## Care Guide
This resilient dry rock moss thrives in bright, exposed conditions, mirroring its native alpine habitats. Provide infrequent yet thorough watering, ensuring dry periods, and avoid regular fertilization due to its minimal nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. Mosses derive most nutrients from dust and rainwater; any fertilization should be extremely diluted and very rare.
