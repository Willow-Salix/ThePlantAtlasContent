## Care Guide
Provide a cool, shady environment with consistently moist, well-drained, and rich organic soil, typical of its native forest understory. Protect from harsh afternoon sun and ensure adequate humidity. Avoid extreme wet or dry conditions to prevent stress or rot.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from light to moderate fertilization with organic matter or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring, mimicking the rich humus layer of a forest floor.
