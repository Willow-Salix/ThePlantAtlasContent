## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America, specifically arctic, subarctic, and alpine regions of Canada and the Western United States (e.g., Alaska, Rocky Mountains). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine |
| **☀️ Light** | High Sun to Partial Sun. This lichen thrives in exposed, bright conditions characteristic of alpine environments, often growing on soil over bedrock with sparse vegetation. |
| **💧 Water** | Frequent moisture from misting, dew, or rainfall, but requires excellent air circulation and drainage to prevent rot. While it can tolerate short periods of dryness (dry-mesic habitat), consistent ambient humidity is crucial for active growth. |

## 🌱 Overview
Catapyrenium is a genus of squamulose lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. These small lichens grow as clusters of tiny scales (squamules that lie flat against rocks and soil, often in dry or disturbed habitats. The genus includes about 18 species found worldwide, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions where they help stabilize soil surfaces.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine earth lichen thrives in cool, bright, and airy environments. It requires consistent surface moisture from misting or high humidity, coupled with excellent drainage, and does not need any supplemental fertilizer. Mimicking its native high-elevation, exposed conditions is key for successful cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and their substrate; synthetic fertilizers can be detrimental.
