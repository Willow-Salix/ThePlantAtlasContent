## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate forests of North America, including parts of Canada and the United States (widespread, with 'var. intermedia' often found in regions like the Great Lakes states). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coniferous and Mixed Deciduous Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Deep shade to very low, dappled light. As a non-photosynthetic plant, it requires virtually no direct sunlight and thrives in the dim understory of dense forests. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but very well-drained soil, mimicking the humus-rich forest floor. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Corallorhiza maculata, or spotted coralroot, is a North American coralroot orchid.  It has three varieties: C. maculata var. occidentalis (western spotted coralroot), C. maculata var. maculata (eastern spotted coralroot or summer coralroot), and C. maculata var. mexicana. It is widespread through Mexico, Guatemala, Canada, St. Pierre & Miquelon, and much of the western and northern United States (though generally absent from the Great Plains and from the lowland parts of the Southeast). It grows mostly in montane woodlands.

## Care Guide
Cultivation is extremely difficult, if not impossible, due to its mycoheterotrophic nature and complete reliance on specific mycorrhizal fungi and host trees. It requires deep shade and undisturbed, consistently moist, well-drained forest soil, making it unsuitable for typical garden or indoor settings.

### Fertilizer
None. This plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it obtains all its nutrients from specific fungi associated with tree roots, rather than through photosynthesis or external fertilization. Attempting to fertilize would be detrimental.
