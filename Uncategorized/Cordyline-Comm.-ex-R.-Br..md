## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of the Western Pacific Ocean, including Southeast Asia, Eastern Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and the Pacific Islands. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Rainforests and Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Prefers protection from harsh afternoon direct sunlight, which can scorch leaves, consistent with its natural understory environment. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out slightly between waterings, reflecting the regular rainfall in its native habitat. High humidity is also beneficial. |

## Introduction
Cordyline is a genus of about 24 species of woody monocotyledonous flowering plants in family Asparagaceae, subfamily Lomandroideae. The subfamily has previously been treated as a separate family Laxmanniaceae, or Lomandraceae. Other authors have placed the genus in the Agavaceae (now Agavoideae). Cordyline is native to the western Pacific Ocean region, from New Zealand, eastern Australia, southeastern Asia and Polynesia, with one species found in southeastern South America.
The name Cordyline comes from the Greek word kordyle, meaning "club," a reference to the enlarged underground stems or rhizomes.

## Care Guide
Cordyline thrives in bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native tropical and subtropical forest environment. Ensure high humidity and regular feeding during warmer months to support robust growth, while protecting it from harsh direct sun.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength, to support vigorous growth typical of its rich native environment.
