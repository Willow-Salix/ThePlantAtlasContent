## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including regions from Alaska south through the western United States (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains) and parts of Canada, often in mountainous areas. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Moist Montane/Subalpine and Riparian zones. Characterized by cool temperatures, moist to wet soils, and environments near water bodies or in damp meadows. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to full sun. It can tolerate full sun in cooler climates or with ample moisture, but benefits from some afternoon shade in hotter regions. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its natural habitat along streambanks and in wet meadows. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Epilobium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae, containing about 197 species. The genus has a worldwide distribution. It is most prevalent in the subarctic, temperate and subantarctic regions, whereas in the subtropics and tropics Epilobium species are restricted to the cool montane biomes, such as the New Guinea Highlands.
The taxonomy of the genus has varied between different botanists, but the modern trend is to include the previously recognised genera Boisduvalia, Chamaenerion (previously Chamerion), Pyrogennema and Zauschneria within Epilobium according to Peter H. Raven, who has extensively studied the willowherbs and merges the other segregate genera into Epilobium. Fringed willowherb (Epilobium ciliatum) is likely a cryptic species complex; apparently these plants also commonly hybridize with their congeners.
Most species are known by the common name willowherbs for their willow-like leaves. Those that were once separated in Boisduvalia are called spike-primroses or boisduvalias. Those Epilobium species previously placed in the Chamaenerion group are known as fireweeds.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in consistently moist to wet soil and prefers partial to full sun, typical of its native habitat in western North American montane and riparian areas. It requires high watering frequency and benefits from average soil fertility, making it relatively low-maintenance regarding nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average soil fertility and typically does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial but is often not necessary.
