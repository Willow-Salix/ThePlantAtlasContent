## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Southeastern United States (from New York south to Florida and west to Texas), Caribbean islands. |
| **Climate** | Warm Temperate to Subtropical Coastal Wetland / Salt Marsh |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open marsh environments. |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to moist soil, tolerates standing water and brackish conditions. Requires frequent watering to maintain saturation if not in a naturally wet environment. |

## Introduction
Kosteletzkya is a genus of the plant family Malvaceae that includes the seashore mallow (K. pentacarpos). It includes about 19 species found worldwide.
Although similar in appearance to Hibiscus, Kosteletzkya typically bears more flattened capsules that dehisce loculicidally. The genus was separated from Hibiscus in 1835 by Carl Borivoj Presl, who named it after Vincenz Franz Kosteletzky (1801–1887).
Phylogenetic evidence supports this genus being polyphyletic, with New World and Malagasy species of Kosteletzkya belonging to completely different clades within the Hibisceae. Under a revised nomenclature, only New World species would retain the genus name Kosteletzkya. An alternate revision would be to merge all New World Kosteletzkya species into Hibiscus.

## Care Guide
Virginia Saltmarsh Mallow thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet, often brackish, soil, mimicking its native coastal marsh habitat. Ensure ample water and bright light for optimal growth, making it an excellent choice for boggy gardens or wetland restoration projects.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from soils rich in organic matter. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied annually during the growing season if soil fertility is low.
