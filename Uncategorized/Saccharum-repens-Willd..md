## Introduction
Imperata cylindrica (commonly known as cogongrass  or kunai grass ) is a species of perennial rhizomatous grass native to tropical and subtropical Asia, Micronesia, Melanesia, Australia, Africa, and Southern Europe. It has also been introduced to Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Southeastern United States. It is a highly flammable pyrophyte, and can spread rapidly by colonizing disturbed areas and encouraging more frequent wildfires.

## Care Guide
Cogongrass thrives in tropical and subtropical grasslands and savannas, requiring full to partial sun and moderate watering with periods of dryness. It is highly adaptable to various soil types and does not demand high fertility. This resilient grass is often found in open, disturbed areas, making it a low-maintenance plant in suitable conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; this plant is adaptable and can grow in nutrient-poor soils, common in its native disturbed habitats.
