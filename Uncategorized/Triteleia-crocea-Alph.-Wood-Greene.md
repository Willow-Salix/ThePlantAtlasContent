## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern California and Southern Oregon, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Temperate Grasslands/Open Woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; requires significant light exposure, especially during its spring growth and bloom period. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering is needed during its active growth phase from fall through late spring. Water should be significantly reduced or withheld completely during its summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Triteleia is a genus of monocotyledon flowering plants also known as triplet lilies. The 16 species are native to western North America, from British Columbia south to California and east to Wyoming and Arizona, with one species in northwestern Mexico. However, they are most common in California. They are perennial plants growing from a fibrous corm roughly spherical in shape. They get their name from the fact that all parts of their flowers come in threes.

## Care Guide
Yellow Triteleia prefers conditions similar to its native Mediterranean climate, requiring full to partial sun and regular watering throughout its active growth season from fall to late spring. It is crucial to provide a dry dormancy period during the summer months to mimic its natural habitat. Fertilize lightly during active growth for best results.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring as new growth emerges, though it generally thrives in moderately fertile soils without heavy feeding.
