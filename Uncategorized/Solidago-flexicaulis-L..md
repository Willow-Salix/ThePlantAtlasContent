## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
To care for Zigzag Goldenrod, provide partial to full shade conditions that mimic its woodland origins. Maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, preferably rich in organic matter, to support its hydration and nutrient needs. Minimal supplemental fertilization is usually required.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to rich soil, high in organic matter, mirroring the nutrient-rich forest floor formed by decomposing leaf litter. Supplemental fertilization is generally not needed if grown in good quality soil.
