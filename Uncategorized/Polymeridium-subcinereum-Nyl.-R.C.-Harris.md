## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in environments with high humidity and indirect light, replicating its native tropical forest understory. Ensure consistent moisture through misting or a humid environment, and avoid direct sun and excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Lichens derive nutrients from the air and rainwater; excessive nutrients can be harmful.
