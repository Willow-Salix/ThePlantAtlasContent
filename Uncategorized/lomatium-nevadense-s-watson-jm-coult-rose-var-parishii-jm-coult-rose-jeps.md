## 🌱 Overview
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in conditions mimicking its arid home: full sun, very well-draining soil, and infrequent watering. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal fertilization, preferring lean conditions to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Native to lean, rocky soils. If fertilized, use a very diluted, low-nitrogen formula sparingly.
