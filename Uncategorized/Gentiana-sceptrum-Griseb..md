## Introduction
Gentiana () is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the gentian family (Gentianaceae), the tribe Gentianeae, and the monophyletic subtribe Gentianinae. With over 300 species, it is considered a large genus. Gentians are notable for their mostly large trumpet-shaped flowers, which are often of an intense blue hue, though some are also bright yellow. The type species of the genus is Gentiana lutea.
The genus name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king who may have discovered tonic properties in gentians.

## Care Guide
This gentian thrives in consistently wet soil and requires full to partial sun, typical of its native wet meadow habitat in western North America. Ensure ample watering and provide only light fertilization to mimic its natural conditions, promoting healthy growth and vibrant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced fertilizer annually in spring is generally sufficient; avoid over-fertilizing.
