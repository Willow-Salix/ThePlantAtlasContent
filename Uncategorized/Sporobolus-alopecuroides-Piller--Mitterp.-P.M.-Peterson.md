## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern Europe, and parts of Western Asia (e.g., Hungary, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, ideally 6 or more hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open grassland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the topsoil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established due to its native climate's varying rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Sporobolus is a nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. The name Sporobolus means "seed-thrower", and is derived from Ancient Greek word σπόρος (spóros), meaning "seed", and the root of βάλλειν (bállein) "to throw", referring to the dispersion of seeds. Members of the genus are usually called dropseeds or sacaton grasses. They are typical prairie and savanna plants, occurring in other types of open habitat in warmer climates. At least one species (S. caespitosus from Saint Helena) is threatened with extinction, and another (S. durus from Ascension Island) is extinct.

## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering, becoming highly drought-tolerant once established. It is a low-maintenance plant needing minimal fertilization, mirroring its adaptation to open, temperate steppe environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich soil.
