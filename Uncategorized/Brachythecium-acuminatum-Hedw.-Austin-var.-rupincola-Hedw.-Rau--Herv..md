## Care Guide
This moss thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate forest floor or rock crevices, requiring consistent moisture and high humidity. Provide low light and avoid direct sun, as well as any significant fertilization. Ensuring stable, humid conditions is paramount for its well-being.

### Fertilizer
Mosses have extremely low nutrient requirements; fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful. If growth seems stagnant, a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (1/10th strength) can be applied sparingly once a year.
