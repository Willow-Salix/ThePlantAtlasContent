## Introduction
Pittosporum ( or ) is a genus of about 250 species of flowering plants in the family Pittosporaceae. Plants in the genus Pittosporum are shrubs or trees with leaves arranged alternately along the stems. The flowers are arranged singly or in cymes, with white to yellow petals fused at the base forming a short tube, with stamens that are free from each other. The fruit is a capsule with a single locule that opens to reveal angular seeds.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native thrives in conditions reminiscent of its tropical wet forest home. Provide bright indirect light or partial shade, ensure consistently moist yet well-draining soil, and offer regular, diluted fertilization during its growing period. High humidity is also greatly beneficial for its well-being.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer) to support robust growth in typically nutrient-rich, organic soils.
