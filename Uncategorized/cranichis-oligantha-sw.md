## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Cranichis oligantha, replicate its tropical montane rainforest habitat by providing consistent moisture to the substrate, very high humidity, and dappled or indirect light. Ensure the potting medium offers excellent drainage to prevent root rot while staying moist.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Apply a diluted (1/4 to 1/2 strength) balanced orchid-specific fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during its active growing season. Terrestrial orchids typically benefit from nutrients provided by decomposing organic matter.
