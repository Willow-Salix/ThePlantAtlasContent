## Introduction
Cerastium is a genus of annual, winter annual, or perennial flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. They are commonly called mouse-ears or mouse-ear chickweeds. There are 214 accepted species, found nearly worldwide but with the greatest concentration in the northern temperate regions. A number of the species are common weeds in fields and on disturbed ground.

Cerastium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora chalcogrammella (which feeds exclusively on Cerastium arvense) and Coleophora striatipennella (which has been recorded on Cerastium fontanum).

## Care Guide
Field Chickweed thrives in temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade and moderate, consistent moisture. It is quite adaptable to various soil types, requiring minimal fertilization due to its natural habitat in average to poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; adapted to average to poor soil conditions commonly found in meadows and disturbed areas.
