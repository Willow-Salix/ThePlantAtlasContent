## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade in well-drained soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and provide light fertilization during the growing season. It is a robust plant, tolerant of some drought once established, making it relatively low-maintenance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the growing season, especially if soil is poor. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and may not require heavy nitrogen application.
