## Care Guide
Arthothelium lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest environment, requiring high humidity and indirect, filtered light. Avoid direct sun and conventional fertilization, as it absorbs nutrients from the atmosphere and relies on constant atmospheric moisture for hydration.

### Fertilizer
Generally requires no conventional fertilizer. Absorbs trace nutrients from air and rainfall. High nutrient levels can be detrimental.
