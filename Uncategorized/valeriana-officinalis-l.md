## 🧤 Care Instructions
Garden Valerian thrives in temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Regular watering is crucial, particularly in dry weather, to emulate its native damp meadow habitats, and it benefits from moderate soil fertility.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; thrives in reasonably fertile, well-draining soils. A balanced organic fertilizer can be beneficial annually.
