## Care Guide
This woodland perennial thrives in partial to full shade, preferring consistently moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. It requires protection from intense afternoon sun and regular watering, especially during its active growing season, to mimic its native forest floor environment.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, well-drained soil high in organic matter. A light application of balanced organic fertilizer or a top-dressing of compost in spring is sufficient.
