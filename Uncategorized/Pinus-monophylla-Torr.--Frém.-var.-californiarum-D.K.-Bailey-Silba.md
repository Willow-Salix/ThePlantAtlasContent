## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily California, parts of Nevada, Arizona, Utah) and northern Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Montane Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), tolerates intense heat and direct exposure. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent; allow soil to dry completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, requires very little supplemental water. |

## Introduction
A pine is any conifer in the genus Pinus () of the family Pinaceae. Pinus is the sole genus in the subfamily Pinoideae. The species are evergreen trees or shrubs with their leaves in bunches, usually of 2 to 5 needles. The seeds are carried on woody cones, with two seeds to each cone scale.
Pines are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere; they occupy large areas of taiga (boreal forest), but are found in many habitats, including the Mediterranean Basin, and dry tropical forests in southeast Asia and Central America. Some are fire-resistant or fire-dependent. 
Pine trees provide one of the most extensively used types of timber. The seeds are used to make dishes such as pesto, while retsina wine is flavoured with pine resin.

## Care Guide
The California Singleleaf Pinyon thrives in full sun and well-draining, often rocky or sandy, soils that mimic its native arid mountain habitat. It is extremely drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low; native soils are typically lean. Requires minimal to no fertilization. If needed, a slow-release, low-nitrogen fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring.
