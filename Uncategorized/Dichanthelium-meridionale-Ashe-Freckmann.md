## Care Guide
Matting Rosette Grass thrives in full to partial sun, mirroring its native open habitats in the humid subtropical southeastern U.S. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization as it's adapted to less nutrient-rich soils. This hardy grass is relatively low-maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to less fertile, sandy soils, so heavy fertilization is not typically needed.
