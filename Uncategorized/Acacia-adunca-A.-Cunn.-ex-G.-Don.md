| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia, specifically the Northern Tablelands and North Coast of New South Wales and adjacent areas of Queensland. |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Dry Sclerophyll Woodland/Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers full sun for optimal growth, reflecting its exposure in open woodlands. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent deep watering. Tolerates dry periods well. |

## Introduction
Acacia, commonly known as wattles or acacias, is a genus of about 1,084 species of shrubs and trees in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the pea family Fabaceae. Initially, it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa, South America, and Australasia, but is now reserved for species mainly from Australia, with others from New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. The genus name is Neo-Latin, borrowed from Koine Greek ἀκακία (akakia), a term used in antiquity to describe a preparation extracted from Vachellia nilotica, the original type species.
Several species of Acacia have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established.

## Care Guide
Wallangarra Wattle is an Australian native thriving in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, mimicking its subtropical dry sclerophyll woodland habitat. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering. It is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, so use minimal or no low-phosphorus fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor Australian soils. If fertilizing, use a slow-release, low-phosphorus formula sparingly.
