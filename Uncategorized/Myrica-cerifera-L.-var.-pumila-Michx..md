## Introduction
Myrica  is a genus of about 35–50 species of small trees and shrubs in the family Myricaceae, order Fagales. The genus has a wide distribution, including Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America, and missing only from Antarctica and Oceania. Some botanists split the genus into two genera on the basis of the catkin and fruit structure, restricting Myrica to a few species, and treating the others in Morella.
Common names include bayberry, bay-rum tree, candleberry, sweet gale, and wax-myrtle. The generic name was derived from the Greek word μυρίκη (myrike), meaning "fragrance".

## Care Guide
This resilient native plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering until established. Once mature, it is drought-tolerant and needs minimal to no fertilization. It adapts well to various moist to well-drained soil types.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer generally needed; as a nitrogen-fixer, it thrives in nutrient-poor soils.
