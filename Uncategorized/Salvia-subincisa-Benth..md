## Introduction
Salvia () is the largest genus of plants in the sage family Lamiaceae, with just under 1,000 species of shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and annuals. Within the Lamiaceae, Salvia is part of the tribe Mentheae within the subfamily Nepetoideae.  One of several genera commonly referred to as sage, it includes two widely used herbs, Salvia officinalis (common sage, or just "sage") and Salvia rosmarinus (rosemary, formerly Rosmarinus officinalis). 
The genus is distributed throughout the Old World and the Americas (over 900 total species), with three distinct regions of diversity: Central America and South America (approximately 600 species); Central Asia and the Mediterranean (250 species); Eastern Asia (90 species).

## Care Guide
Sawtooth Sage thrives in full sun and requires minimal, infrequent watering, making it highly drought-tolerant. It prefers lean, well-draining soil and generally does not need fertilization, reflecting its adaptations to arid scrubland environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. It thrives in lean, well-draining soils typical of deserts and does not require heavy fertilization. Excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
