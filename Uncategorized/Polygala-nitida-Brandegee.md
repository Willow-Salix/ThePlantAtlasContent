## Introduction
Polygala is a large genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygalaceae. They are commonly known as milkworts or snakeroots. The genus is distributed widely throughout much of the world in temperate zones and the tropics. The genus name Polygala comes from the ancient Greek "much milk", as the plant was thought to increase milk yields in cattle.

## Care Guide
The Shining Milkwort is a desert-adapted plant requiring full sun and excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings, and has very low fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs, as it originates from nutrient-poor desert soils. A very light application of a balanced, diluted fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient, or none at all if soil is adequately amended.
