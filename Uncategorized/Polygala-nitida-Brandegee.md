## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Shining Milkwort is a desert-adapted plant requiring full sun and excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings, and has very low fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs, as it originates from nutrient-poor desert soils. A very light application of a balanced, diluted fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient, or none at all if soil is adequately amended.
