## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant shrub thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soil, mirroring its native arid scrubland habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and fertilize minimally or not at all. It is an ideal plant for xeriscaping or low-maintenance, dry garden settings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native to lean soils, it does not require rich nutrients. If growth appears very weak, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring might be beneficial.
