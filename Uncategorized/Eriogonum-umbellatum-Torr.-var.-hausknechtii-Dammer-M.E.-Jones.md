## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Intermountain West of the United States. |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Montane and High Desert Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, thriving in open, exposed locations. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly and allow soil to dry completely between waterings, especially during active growth. Reduce watering significantly in dormancy. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
Hausknecht's Buckwheat thrives in bright, open conditions with excellent drainage, mimicking its native arid montane and high desert habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires very infrequent watering once established, along with minimal or no supplemental fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Prefers lean, well-drained soils. Minimal to no fertilization is required; rich soils or excessive fertilizer can be detrimental.
