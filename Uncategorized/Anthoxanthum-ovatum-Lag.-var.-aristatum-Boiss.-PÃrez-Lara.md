## Introduction
Anthoxanthum (Latinised Greek for "yellow blossom"), commonly known as hornworts, vernal grasses, or vernalgrasses, is a genus of plants in the grass family. The  generic name means 'yellow flower' in Botanical Latin, referring to the colour of the mature spikelets.
The members of Anthoxanthum are widespread in temperate and subtropical parts of Africa and Eurasia, with a few species in tropical mountains. Some species have become naturalized in Australia, New Zealand, and the Americas. Anthoxanthum odoratum is a common species of acidic grassland and bogs in northern Europe. All the species reportedly contain the compound coumarin, used medicinally in many countries.
The genus Hierochloe is included in Anthoxanthum by some recent authors. Others, however, continue to treat them as separate genera, and we provisionally treat them as such here pending further research.

## Care Guide
This Mediterranean grass prefers full sun and well-draining soil, tolerating dry conditions once established. Water moderately during its active growth in cooler seasons, reducing frequency during hot, dry summers. It generally requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate needs; benefits from a light application of a balanced fertilizer in early spring, especially if grown in poor soil.
