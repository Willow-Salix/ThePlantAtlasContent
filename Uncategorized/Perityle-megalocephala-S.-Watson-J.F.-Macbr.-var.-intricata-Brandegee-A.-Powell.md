## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. It thrives in open, unshaded conditions. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering is sufficient. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its native drought conditions. Highly drought-tolerant once established. |

## Introduction
Perityle is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family. They are known generally as rock daisies.
Perityle is a variable genus, with its members sharing few characteristics. They include small herbs to spreading shrubs and most bear yellow or white daisylike flower heads. The fruit is generally a flat seed with thickened margins which may or may not have a pappus or scales. Plants of this genus are native to North and South America.
A study including morphological and cytological analyses and a phylogenomic analysis of chloroplast and nuclear genomes was published in 2022, and concluded that Perityle as previously circumscribed was polyphyletic. The authors revived and/or expanded the genera Galinsogeopsis, Laphamia, and Nesothamnus to establish monophyletic clades. The small genus Amauria and the Desventuradas Islands endemic species Lycapsus tenuifolius were merged into Perityle, leaving it with 13 species.

## Care Guide
This desert-native thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, being highly drought-tolerant. Ensure excellent soil drainage to prevent root rot, and fertilize sparingly, as it is adapted to lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilization needs. It is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils, so excessive fertilizer is not recommended. A very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once a year in spring if growth appears sluggish.
