## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across tropical and subtropical Africa, Asia (e.g., India, Southeast Asia), Australia, and the Pacific Islands. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests, often found in disturbed areas, forest margins, and coastal thickets. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth and abundant flowering, but can tolerate partial shade, particularly in regions with intense afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture during its active growing season, ideally allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. While it can tolerate short dry spells, it thrives with regular water. |

## Introduction
Camonea umbellata, commonly known as hogvine, yellow merremia, and yellow wood rose, is a thin vine growing to a maximum thickness of 2 cm (0.79 in). It has many uses in Indian traditional medicines. The flowers attract bees, butterflies and birds.

## Care Guide
Hogvine thrives in warm, humid tropical to subtropical conditions with ample sunlight. It requires consistent soil moisture, allowing for slight drying between waterings, and benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growth period to support its vigorous vining habit.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced liquid fertilizer applied every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer) will support vigorous growth and flowering.
