## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern Australia (primarily New South Wales, west of the Great Dividing Range) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Dry Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open woodland habitat on exposed ridges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is crucial for establishment. Once mature, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, mimicking native dry periods. |

## Introduction
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## Care Guide
This Brittled Gum thrives in full sun and well-drained, often poor soils, reflecting its native temperate dry woodland habitat. It requires regular water during establishment but becomes highly drought-tolerant with age, and benefits from minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Adapted to nutrient-poor soils; excessive fertilization, especially with high phosphorus, can be detrimental. If necessary, use a slow-release, low-phosphorus native plant formula sparingly.
