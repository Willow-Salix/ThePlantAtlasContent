## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Alpine regions, including Greenland, Scandinavia, the Alps, and Rocky Mountains. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure is tolerated, but it critically requires very cool ambient temperatures, often accompanied by periods of snow cover. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture, often from snowmelt or frequent precipitation. High ambient humidity or regular misting/wetting of the substrate is beneficial; avoid prolonged dryness. |

## Introduction
Solorina is a genus of 10 species of lichenized fungi in the family Peltigeraceae. The genus was first described by the Swedish botanist Erik Acharius in 1808. Members of the genus are commonly called socket lichens.

## Care Guide
To care for Chocolate Chip Lichen, replicate its native arctic-alpine habitat by providing bright, cool conditions, ideally with temperatures below typical indoor ranges. Ensure consistent moisture through high humidity or regular wetting of its base-rich substrate, avoiding dry periods.

### Fertilizer
Not typically required. This lichen thrives on base-rich or calcareous substrates and obtains nutrients from the environment and its nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial partner.
