## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (primarily Rocky Mountains and Great Basin regions, including states like Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (requires at least 6+ hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking open mountain slopes and meadows) |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent watering during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications. Requires excellent drainage, as it is accustomed to well-drained mountain soils. |

## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native montane habitat. Water moderately during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. Due to its hemiparasitic nature, avoid rich, fertilized soils and ensure it has a suitable host plant for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. As a root hemiparasite, it obtains nutrients from host plants and thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Rich or heavily fertilized conditions are detrimental.
