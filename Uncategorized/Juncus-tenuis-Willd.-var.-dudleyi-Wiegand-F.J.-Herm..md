## Care Guide
Dudley's Rush thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native temperate moist meadow and riparian habitats. It is an adaptable plant suitable for water gardens or boggy areas where it can receive ample water and light. Fertilization is typically low priority, as it can grow well in various soil types.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied infrequently if growth is sluggish, but is often unnecessary in naturally rich moist soils.
