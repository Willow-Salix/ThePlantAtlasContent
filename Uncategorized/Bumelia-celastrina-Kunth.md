## Introduction
Sideroxylon celastrinum is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae, that is native to Texas and Florida in the United States south through Central America to northern Venezuela and Colombia in South America. Common names include saffron plum and coma. It is a spiny shrub or small tree that reaches a height of 2–9 m (6.6–29.5 ft). The dark green leaves are alternate or fascicled at the nodes and oblanceolate to obovate. Greenish-white flowers are present from May to November and are followed by single-seeded, blue-black drupes.

## Care Guide
Saffron Plum is a highly resilient, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining, often poor soils. It requires infrequent watering once established and minimal fertilization. Its hardiness makes it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or challenging, exposed locations.

### Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; prefers lean, well-draining soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once annually in spring is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally fertile soil.
