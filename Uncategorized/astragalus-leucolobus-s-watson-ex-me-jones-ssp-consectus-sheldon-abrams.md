## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native milk-vetch prefers full sun and very well-draining soil, characteristic of its semi-arid Mediterranean origins. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, with minimal to no fertilization needed due to its nitrogen-fixing nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen into the soil, thriving in lean to moderately rich, well-draining soils.
