## Care Guide
Northern Starwort thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions, reflecting its native temperate and subalpine forest habitats. It requires consistently damp soil and protection from direct, intense sunlight. Provide light fertilization to support its growth in less rich environments.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season, considering its natural habitat often provides nutrients from decaying organic matter.
