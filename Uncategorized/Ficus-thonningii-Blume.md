## Introduction
Ficus ( or ) is a genus of about 850 species of woody trees, shrubs, vines, epiphytes and hemiepiphytes in the family Moraceae. Collectively known as fig trees or figs, they are native throughout the tropics with a few species extending into the semi-warm temperate zone. The common fig (F. carica) is a temperate species native to southwest Asia and the Mediterranean region (from Afghanistan  to Portugal), which has been widely cultivated from ancient times for its fruit, also referred to as figs. The fruit of most other species are also edible though they are usually of only local economic importance or eaten as bushfood. However, they are extremely important food resources for wildlife. Figs are also of considerable cultural importance throughout the tropics, both as objects of worship and for their many practical uses.

## Care Guide
Ficus thonningii, a resilient African fig, thrives in bright, direct to indirect sunlight. It requires regular watering during its active growth period, with soil allowed to dry between waterings, and benefits from moderate fertilization during spring and summer. This species is adaptable and can tolerate periods of drought once established.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during spring and summer; reduce or stop in fall and winter.
