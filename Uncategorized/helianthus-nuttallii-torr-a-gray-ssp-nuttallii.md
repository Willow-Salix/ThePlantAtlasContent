## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western and Central North America, including many states in the US (e.g., Colorado, Montana, Utah, California, Texas) and provinces in Canada (e.g., Alberta, Saskatchewan). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grasslands, Prairies, and Moist Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is ideal, as it originates from open, exposed habitats. It can tolerate very light partial shade but will be leggier. |
| **💧 Water** | High. Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking its native habitat in moist prairies and meadows. Water regularly, especially during dry periods, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Helianthus nuttallii, or Nuttall's sunflower, is a species of sunflower native to northern, central, and western North America, from Newfoundland west to British Columbia, south to Missouri, New Mexico, and California.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Nuttall's Sunflower thrives in full sun and requires consistent moisture, preferring continuously damp but well-drained soil. As a hardy plant from temperate grasslands, it needs regular watering but minimal fertilization in good quality soil.
