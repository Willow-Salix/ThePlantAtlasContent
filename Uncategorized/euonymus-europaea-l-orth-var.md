## 🧤 Care Instructions
The European Spindle is a hardy plant that thrives in a range of light conditions from full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained, consistently moist soil. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and a general-purpose fertilizer once a year in spring if needed. It is adaptable and relatively low-maintenance once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied in spring, especially if the soil is poor or growth is desired. Generally not a heavy feeder.
