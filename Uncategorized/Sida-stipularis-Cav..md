## Care Guide
This tropical/subtropical plant thrives in bright light and appreciates consistent moisture during its active growth. Provide regular feeding to support vigorous development, especially in warmer months. Protect from extended dry periods but allow for slight soil drying between waterings to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer), typically every 2-4 weeks.
