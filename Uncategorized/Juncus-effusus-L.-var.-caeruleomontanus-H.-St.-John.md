## Care Guide
This variety of Soft Rush requires consistently wet to boggy conditions, mimicking its native temperate montane wet meadows. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil never dries out. While it can tolerate nutrient-rich environments, light fertilization during the growing season is beneficial if native soil is lacking.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in naturally rich, mucky wetland soils; light fertilization during the growing season if soil nutrients are poor.
