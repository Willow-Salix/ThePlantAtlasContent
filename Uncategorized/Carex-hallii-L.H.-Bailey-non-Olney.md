## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Hall's Sedge prefers full to partial sun, thriving in open environments similar to its native prairie habitat. It requires consistently moist soil conditions, reflecting its natural presence in wet meadows and fens. Minimal fertilization is typically needed, but a light application in spring can promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate (adapted to nutrient-rich prairie soils, a light, balanced fertilizer in spring if needed)
