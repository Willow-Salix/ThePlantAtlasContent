## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in cool, humid conditions with consistent moisture and low to moderate indirect light. It requires minimal nutrients and prefers calcareous substrates. Mimic its natural habitat of moist rock faces in shady, temperate environments to ensure success.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Mosses have very low nutrient demands; if desired, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (1/10th strength) can be applied very infrequently.
