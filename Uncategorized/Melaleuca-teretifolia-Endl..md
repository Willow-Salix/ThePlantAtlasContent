## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western Australia, specifically coastal and near-coastal regions. |
| **Climate** | Wetlands and watercourses within a Mediterranean climate zone, characterized by winter-wet and summer-dry periods, but where this species occupies consistently moist to wet habitats. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for optimal growth. |
| **Watering** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, tolerating waterlogging. It should not be allowed to dry out completely, especially during establishment and active growth. |

## Introduction
Melaleuca () is a genus of nearly 300 species of plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, commonly known as paperbarks, honey-myrtles, bottlebrushes or tea-trees (although the last name is also applied to species of Leptospermum). They range in size from small shrubs that rarely grow to more than 16 m (52 ft) high, to trees up to 35 m (115 ft). Their flowers generally occur in groups, forming a "head" or "spike" resembling a brush used for cleaning bottles, containing up to 80 individual flowers.
Melaleucas are an important food source for nectarivorous insects, birds, and mammals. Many are popular garden plants, either for their attractive flowers or as dense screens and a few have economic value for producing fencing and oils such as "tea tree" oil. Most melaleucas are endemic to Australia, with a few also occurring in Malesia. Seven are endemic to New Caledonia, and one is found only on Australia's Lord Howe Island. 
Melaleucas are found in a wide variety of habitats. Many are adapted for life in swamps and boggy places, while others thrive in the poorest of sandy soils or on the edge of saltpans. Some have a wide distribution and are common, whilst others are rare and endangered. Land clearing, exotic myrtle rust, and especially draining and clearing of swamps threaten many species.

## Care Guide
Banjarath thrives in full sun and demands consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native swampy habitats in Western Australia. It prefers low-nutrient conditions, necessitating minimal, low-phosphorus fertilization. Consistent hydration is key, particularly in warmer months.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers poor to moderately fertile soils. If fertilizing, use a low-phosphorus, slow-release native plant formula very sparingly to avoid nutrient burn.
