## Care Guide
This coastal native thrives in full sun and well-drained sandy soils with minimal water once established. Avoid excessive fertilization as it is a nitrogen-fixer.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-drained soils due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.
