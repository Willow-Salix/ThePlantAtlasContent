## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including mountainous regions of California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane, characterized by distinct seasons, often with dry summers, snowy winters, and moderate spring/fall precipitation. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Shade. It thrives in open slopes, meadows, and woodland edges where it receives ample light but can tolerate some afternoon shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. It prefers consistent moisture but is tolerant of some drought once established, reflecting its native habitat with seasonal precipitation and dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sticky Cinquefoil thrives in conditions similar to its native temperate montane habitat. Provide full sun to partial shade and moderate, consistent watering in well-drained soil. This resilient plant is low-maintenance, requiring only minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Native to often rocky or less fertile soils, it typically does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if growth is slow.
