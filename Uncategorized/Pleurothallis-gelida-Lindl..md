## Introduction
Pleurothallis is a genus of orchids commonly called bonnet orchids. The genus name is derived from the Greek word pleurothallos, meaning "riblike branches". This refers to the rib-like stems of many species. The genus is often abbreviated as "Pths" in horticultural trade.
This was a huge genus, which contained more than 1,200 species - the second largest in the Orchidaceae after Bulbophyllum. In 2004, it decreased by more than half when many species were moved into new genera.

## Care Guide
This orchid thrives in cool to intermediate temperatures with high humidity and consistent moisture, mimicking its native cloud forest environment. Provide bright, indirect light and ensure excellent air circulation to prevent fungal issues. Fertilize sparingly during periods of active growth.

### Fertilizer
Dilute fertilizer (1/4 to 1/2 strength of a balanced orchid formula) applied every 2-3 waterings during active growth.
