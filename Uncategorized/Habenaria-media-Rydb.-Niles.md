## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid requires consistently moist to wet conditions, replicating its native bog and fen habitats in temperate North America. Provide full sun to partial shade and use a low-strength fertilizer sparingly to ensure optimal growth and health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as wetland soils are often low in available nutrients; use a dilute, balanced orchid fertilizer sparingly.
