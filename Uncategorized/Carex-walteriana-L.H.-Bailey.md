## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Walter's Sedge thrives in consistently wet, acidic soils under full sun to partial shade, mimicking its natural bog and wetland habitat. It requires very little fertilization and should never be allowed to dry out, ideally kept in constantly saturated conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; naturally occurs in nutrient-poor, acidic soils characteristic of bogs and wet pinelands.
