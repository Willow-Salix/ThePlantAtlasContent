## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This sedge requires consistently moist to wet soil, reflecting its native wetland and bog habitats. Provide partial shade to partial sun, avoiding intense direct sunlight. Fertilization should be light and infrequent, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Native bog and woodland soils are often nutrient-poor, so infrequent feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer is sufficient, particularly if grown in an appropriate substrate.
