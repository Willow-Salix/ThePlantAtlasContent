| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo (Malaysia, Indonesia) and parts of Thailand |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. It can tolerate some shade but thrives with good light exposure typical of forest edges or clearings, avoiding harsh, direct midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil, reflecting the high rainfall and humidity of its native environment. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Vigna is a genus of plants in the legume family, Fabaceae, with  a pantropical distribution. It includes some well-known cultivated species, including many types of beans. Some are former members of the genus Phaseolus. According to Hortus Third, Vigna differs from Phaseolus in biochemistry and pollen structure, and in details of the style and stipules.
Vigna is also commonly confused with the genus Dolichos, but the two differ in stigma structure.
Vigna are herbs or occasionally subshrubs. The leaves are pinnate, divided into 3 leaflets. The inflorescence is a raceme of yellow, blue, or purple pea flowers. The fruit is a legume pod of varying shapes containing seeds.
Familiar food species include the adzuki bean (V. angularis), the black gram (V. mungo), the cowpea (V. unguiculata, including the variety known as the black-eyed pea), and the mung bean (V. radiata). Each of these may be used as a whole bean, a bean paste, or as bean sprouts.
The genus is named after Domenico Vigna, a seventeenth-century Italian botanist and director of the Orto botanico di Pisa.

## Care Guide
Provide bright, indirect light or partial sun and keep the soil consistently moist but well-draining, mimicking its tropical rainforest origin. Fertilize moderately during growth, noting its natural nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, diluted fertilizer every few weeks during the active growing season. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen fertilization is not necessary.
