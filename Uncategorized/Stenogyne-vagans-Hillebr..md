## Care Guide
To thrive, Stenogyne Vagans requires conditions similar to its native Hawaiian wet forest: consistent moisture, high humidity, and bright, indirect light. Protect it from direct sun and ensure the soil remains moist but well-drained, with light fertilization during active growth periods.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring/summer), diluted to half strength. Reduce or stop in winter.
