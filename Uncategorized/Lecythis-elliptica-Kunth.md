| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Brazil (Amazon basin), French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure is ideal for mature trees, reflecting their status as canopy or emergent trees in their native habitat. Young plants may tolerate some partial shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Frequent and consistent watering is necessary to keep the soil continuously moist but not waterlogged, mimicking the high, year-round rainfall of tropical rainforests. Ensure excellent drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecythis ( LESS-ith-iss) is a genus of woody plants in the Lecythidaceae family first described as a genus in 1758. It is native to Central America and South America. Several species produce edible seeds and referred to by a variety of common names including paradise nut, monkey pot, cream nut, and sapucaia nut.
A phylogenetic study published in 2024 by Vargas et al. concluded that Lecythis was polyphyletic. The authors proposed leaving the core Ollaria clade in Lecythis, and placing the Poiteau and Chartacea sections of Lecythis in a revived Chytroma, the Pisonis section in a reinstated Pachylecythis, and the Corrugata clade in the new genus Guaiania.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical rainforest tree thrives in full sun with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native abundant rainfall. Regular fertilization during its active growth will support its robust development as a large canopy tree.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires moderate to high fertilization during the active growing season with a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer, due to the rapid growth and significant nutrient demands of large rainforest trees.
