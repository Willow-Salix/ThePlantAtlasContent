## 🌱 Overview
Campanula () is the type genus of the Campanulaceae family of flowering plants. Campanula are commonly known as bellflowers and take both their common and scientific names from the bell-shaped flowers—campanula is Latin for "little bell".
The genus includes over 500 species and several subspecies, distributed across the temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with centers of diversity in the Mediterranean region, Balkans, Caucasus and mountains of western Asia. The range also extends into mountains in tropical regions of Asia and Africa.

The species include annual, biennial and perennial plants, and vary in habit from dwarf arctic and alpine species under 5 cm high, to large temperate grassland and woodland species growing to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Eastwood's bellflower thrives in full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native Mediterranean scrubland environment on California's Channel Islands. It prefers moderate watering during its active growth but is drought-tolerant once established, requiring well-draining soil. Fertilize lightly in spring with a balanced, slow-release product to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied in early spring, or light liquid feeding during the growing season, is sufficient. Avoid over-fertilization.
