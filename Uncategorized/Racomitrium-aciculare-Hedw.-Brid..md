## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including Western Europe (e.g., British Isles, Scandinavia), Pacific Northwest of North America, and parts of East Asia. Also found in similar climates in the Southern Hemisphere. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Oceanic and Montane, characterized by high rainfall, cool temperatures, and high humidity, often found near streams or waterfalls. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to bright indirect light. While it can tolerate some direct morning sun, it prefers protection from harsh afternoon sun to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, but not waterlogged, conditions and very high atmospheric humidity. Benefits from frequent misting or placement in a terrarium/paludarium to mimic its damp, waterside native habitat. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, highly humid environments reminiscent of its native temperate oceanic or montane habitats. Provide partial shade to bright indirect light and ensure consistently moist conditions with high atmospheric humidity, avoiding direct harsh sun. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its low nutrient requirements.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs and can be harmed by excessive fertilization. If desired, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/8th strength) can be applied sparingly once or twice a year.
