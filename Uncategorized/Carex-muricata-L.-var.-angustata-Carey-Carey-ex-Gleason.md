## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in temperate conditions with full sun to partial shade. Ensure consistent moisture but allow for good drainage, and apply fertilizer sparingly as it adapts well to average soil fertility.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it naturally grows in average to poor soils; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient.
