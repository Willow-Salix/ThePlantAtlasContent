## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, Montana, Wyoming), specifically in the Cascade Range and Rocky Mountains. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate full sun in cooler climates but prefers protection from intense afternoon heat. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained, especially during the growing season. Mimics its native habitat of wet, rocky areas fed by snowmelt. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely or become waterlogged. |

## Introduction
Micranthes is a genus of flowering plants in the saxifrage family. It was formerly included within the genus Saxifraga until DNA evidence from 1996 showed the members of what is now Micranthes are more closely related to Boykinia and Heuchera than to other members of the genus Saxifraga.
All members of this genus are herbaceous, with prominent basal leaves. They are found in temperate, arctic, and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.

## Care Guide
Lyall's Saxifrage is an alpine plant that thrives in cool, consistently moist, well-drained conditions. It prefers bright indirect to partial sun and requires minimal fertilization. Ensure the soil never dries out completely but also isn't waterlogged.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. If desired, use a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer once in early spring.
