## Care Guide
This fern thrives in conditions mirroring its tropical understory origins, requiring consistent moisture and high humidity, while being protected from direct sun. Ensure the soil remains damp and provide ample ambient humidity to prevent frond crisping, feeding sparingly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding during the growing season (spring/summer) with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., half strength monthly).
