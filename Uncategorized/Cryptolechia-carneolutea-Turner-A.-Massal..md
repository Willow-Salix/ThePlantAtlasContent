## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in a humid, shaded environment, mimicking its native subtropical forest habitat. Provide consistent moisture through frequent misting or a high-humidity setup, and absolutely avoid direct sunlight. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Extremely minimal to none. Lichens acquire most of their nutrients from the air and water. Standard fertilizers are typically harmful and should be avoided.
