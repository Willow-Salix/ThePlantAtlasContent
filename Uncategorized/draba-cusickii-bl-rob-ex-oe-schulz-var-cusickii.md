## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (mountainous regions of Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Wyoming, Utah) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, reflecting its exposure to intense high-altitude sunlight with little shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is adapted to well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established; avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Draba is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, commonly known as whitlow-grasses (though they are not related to the true grasses).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cusick's draba thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native rocky, alpine habitat. Water moderately, letting the soil dry out, and fertilize sparingly or not at all. This ensures its compact growth and overall health in a garden setting.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. Alpine soils are typically nutrient-poor; rich soil or over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth rather than the desired compact form.
