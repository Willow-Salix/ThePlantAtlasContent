## Introduction
Lepidium is a genus of plants in the mustard/cabbage family, Brassicaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. It includes familiar species such as garden cress, maca, and dittander. General common names include peppercress, peppergrass, pepperweed, and pepperwort.  Some species form tumbleweeds.
The genus name Lepidium is from Greek meaning 'small scale', which is thought to be derived from a folk medicine usage of the plant to treat leprosy, which cause small scales on the skin. Another meaning is related to the small scale-like fruit.

## Care Guide
This plant flourishes in full sun, characteristic of its native Central Asian semi-deserts and steppes. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering and tolerating prolonged dry periods. Fertilization needs are minimal, as it's adapted to less fertile or saline soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Adapted to less fertile and saline soils, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient, or none if soil is already rich.
