| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-arid Grassland/Savanna |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate; highly drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sporobolus is a nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. The name Sporobolus means "seed-thrower", and is derived from Ancient Greek word σπόρος (spóros), meaning "seed", and the root of βάλλειν (bállein) "to throw", referring to the dispersion of seeds. Members of the genus are usually called dropseeds or sacaton grasses. They are typical prairie and savanna plants, occurring in other types of open habitat in warmer climates. At least one species (S. caespitosus from Saint Helena) is threatened with extinction, and another (S. durus from Ascension Island) is extinct.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and is well-adapted to semi-arid conditions, making it exceptionally drought-tolerant. It requires minimal watering once established and does not typically need regular fertilization, preferring well-draining soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Generally not required for healthy established plants. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once a year in spring if growth appears weak.
