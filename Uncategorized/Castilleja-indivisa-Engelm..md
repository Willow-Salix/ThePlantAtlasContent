## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
This wildflower thrives in full sun exposure with moderate, consistent watering, especially during its active growth and bloom periods, while allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Direct fertilization is generally not recommended due to its hemiparasitic nature, which means it derives nutrients from nearby host plants. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to no direct fertilizer needed. As a hemiparasite, it obtains most of its nutrients from host plants, making additional fertilization often unnecessary or even detrimental.
