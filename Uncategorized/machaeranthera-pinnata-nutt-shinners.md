## 🌱 Overview
Machaeranthera is a genus of North American flowering plants in the family Asteraceae which are known by the common name tansyaster.
Tansyasters are variable in appearance. Some are small, singular wildflowers, while others are sprawling shrubs. Several species easily hybridize with each other, as well, making identification difficult. In general, members of the genus may be identified by the sharp-pointed, dagger-shaped anthers in the disc florets at the center of the flower. The flower heads are usually daisylike, and are usually a shade of purple or blue, but may be pink, yellow, or white. Tansyasters are native to western North America.
The genus Machaeranthera is distinguished from the genus Dieteria by having once- or twice-pinnate leaves, whereas Dieteria has entire to toothed leaves.
Machaeranthera means "swordlike anthers".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid scrubland environment. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and fertilize sparingly as it prefers lean conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean, well-draining soil. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, during the growing season.
