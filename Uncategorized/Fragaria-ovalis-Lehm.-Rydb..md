## Introduction
Fragaria () is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, commonly known as strawberries for their edible fruits. There are more than 20 described species and many hybrids and cultivars. The most common strawberries grown commercially are cultivars of the garden strawberry, a hybrid known as Fragaria × ananassa. Strawberries have a taste that varies by cultivar, and ranges from quite sweet to rather tart. Strawberries are an important commercial fruit crop, widely grown in all temperate regions of the world.

## Care Guide
The Fuzzy-fruited Strawberry thrives in temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide moderate fertilization, especially during active growth and fruiting, to support its health and berry production. Ensure adequate moisture without waterlogging, mimicking its native habitat along streams and in open woodlands.

### Fertilizer
Moderate nutrient needs. Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose organic fertilizer application in early spring and potentially once more during the growing season, particularly when actively fruiting.
