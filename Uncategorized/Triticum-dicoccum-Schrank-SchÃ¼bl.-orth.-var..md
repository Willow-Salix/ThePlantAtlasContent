## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Fertile Crescent (Levant, Mesopotamia), including modern-day Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (semi-arid, with warm/hot dry summers and mild wet winters), transitioning to Temperate Continental in some historical cultivation areas. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, as it's an open-field crop in its native environment and requires ample light for grain development. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is needed, especially during germination and grain development. Its native climate with distinct wet and dry seasons means it can tolerate some drought once established but thrives with consistent moisture during its active growth period. Allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Wheat is a group of wild and domesticated grasses of the genus Triticum (). They are cultivated for their cereal grains, which are staple foods around the world. Well-known wheat species and hybrids include the most widely grown common wheat (T. aestivum), spelt, durum, emmer, einkorn, and Khorasan or Kamut. The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BC.
Wheat is grown on a larger area of land than any other food crop (220.7 million hectares or 545 million acres in 2021). World trade in wheat is greater than that of all other crops combined. In 2021, world wheat production was 771 million tonnes (850 million short tons), making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (known as corn in North America and Australia; wheat is often called corn in other countries including Britain). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century. Global demand for wheat is increasing because of the usefulness of gluten to the food industry.
Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates. Globally, it is the leading source of vegetable proteins in human food, having a protein content of about 13%, which is relatively high compared to other major cereals but relatively low in protein quality (supplying essential amino acids). When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fibre. In a small part of the general population, gluten – which comprises most of the protein in wheat – can trigger coeliac disease, noncoeliac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia, and dermatitis herpetiformis.

## Care Guide
Emmer wheat thrives in full sun and requires moderate, consistent watering, especially during key growth stages. Originating from Mediterranean climates, it is adapted to distinct wet/dry seasons. Moderate fertilization will support healthy growth and good grain yield.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization is generally sufficient. It benefits from balanced nutrients, particularly nitrogen during early growth and phosphorus/potassium during flowering and grain fill. As an ancient grain, it is less demanding than modern hybrid wheats but still performs best in moderately fertile soil.
