## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including North America, Europe, and Asia, particularly in northern temperate and boreal wetlands. |
| **Climate** | Boreal and Temperate Wetlands (Fens, Bogs) |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate some direct morning sun if kept consistently wet, but intense afternoon sun should be avoided to prevent drying. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently saturated conditions, mimicking its native wetland habitat. Should never be allowed to dry out; often thrives when partially submerged in water. |

## Introduction
Warnstorfia is a genus of mosses.  They are known as fattigkrokmossor in Swedish and sikkelmos p.p. in Dutch.  It was named in honor of Carl Friedrich Warnstorf.

## Care Guide
Warnstorfia Moss thrives in consistently wet to saturated environments, similar to its native fen and bog habitats. Provide bright, indirect light and maintain very high humidity, ensuring the substrate never dries out. It requires minimal to no fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient needs. Avoid traditional fertilizers; if used at all, apply a highly diluted, specialized moss or aquatic plant fertilizer sparingly once or twice a year.
