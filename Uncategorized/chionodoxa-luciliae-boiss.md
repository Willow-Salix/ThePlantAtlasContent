## 🌱 Overview
Scilla section Chionodoxa, known as glory-of-the-snow, is a small group of bulbous perennial flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Scilloideae. Formerly treated as the separate genus Chionodoxa, they are now included in Scilla as a section. The section is endemic to the eastern Mediterranean, specifically Crete, Cyprus and Turkey. The blue, white or pink flowers appear early in the year making them valuable garden ornamentals. The common name of the group is based on the habit of flowering in high alpine zones when the snow melts in spring.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Plant in well-drained soil in a location receiving full sun to partial shade, ensuring full sun exposure during its early spring bloom. Water consistently during its spring growth period, then allow the soil to dry out when the plant enters summer dormancy. Apply a light bulb fertilizer in early spring for optimal blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced bulb fertilizer in early spring as new growth emerges. Amending soil with organic matter at planting is beneficial.
