## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and north to North Carolina and Arkansas) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in open woodlands, sandy fields, and disturbed areas) |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade, thriving with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. It can tolerate some afternoon shade in the hottest climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Allow the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out completely between waterings. It tolerates occasional dry spells but performs best with consistent moisture during its active growth period, avoiding waterlogged conditions. |

## Introduction
Commelina is a genus of approximately 208 species commonly called dayflowers due to the short lives of their flowers. They are less often known as widow's tears. It is by far the largest genus of its family, Commelinaceae. The Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus of the 18th century named the genus after the two Dutch botanists Jan Commelijn and his nephew Caspar, each representing one of the showy petals of Commelina communis.
The dayflowers are herbs that may be either perennial or annual. They are characterised by their zygomorphic flowers and by the involucral bracts called spathes that surround the flower stalks. These spathes are often filled with a mucilaginous liquid. Each spathe houses either one or two scorpioid cymes, with the upper cyme being either vestigial or bearing from one to several typically male flowers, and the lower cyme bearing several flowers. All members of the genus have alternate leaves.
The Asiatic dayflower (Commelina communis) is probably the best known species in the West. It is a common weed in parts of Europe and throughout eastern North America. Several species, such as Commelina benghalensis, are eaten as a leaf vegetable in Southeast Asia and Africa.

## Care Guide
This adaptable plant, native to the humid subtropics, thrives in warm conditions with plenty of sunlight. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and benefits from a light fertilizer regimen. Its robust nature makes it relatively low-maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a diluted liquid feed once or twice during the growing season (spring/summer) is generally sufficient, especially if grown in containers or poor soil.
