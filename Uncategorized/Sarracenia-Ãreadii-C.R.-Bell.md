## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (derived from parent species native to coastal plains and bogs) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Bogs and Wet Savannas |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily is ideal) mimicking their open bog habitat. |
| **Watering** | Maintain consistently moist to wet soil at all times; never allow the soil to dry out. Use only distilled water, rainwater, or reverse osmosis water due to their sensitivity to minerals, typically via the tray method. |

## Introduction
Pitcher plants are  carnivorous plants that have modified leaves known as pitfall traps—prey-trapping mechanisms featuring a deep cavity filled with digestive liquid. The traps of what are considered to be "true" pitcher plants are formed by specialized leaves. The plants attract and drown the prey with nectar.

## Care Guide
Sarracenia x readii requires full sun exposure and consistently wet, nutrient-poor, acidic soil conditions, mimicking its native bog habitat. Always use pure water sources like distilled or rainwater, and avoid any soil-based fertilization, as the plant acquires nutrients from insects.

### Fertilizer
Do not fertilize the soil. These carnivorous plants obtain all necessary nutrients from insects they capture naturally. Fertilizing the soil can be detrimental.
