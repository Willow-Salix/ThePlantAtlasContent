## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | This organism is a genus of lichenicolous fungi, not a plant. Its distribution is tied to its host lichen species, which are widespread globally across various continents and regions. |
| **Climate** | As a lichenicolous fungus (meaning it grows on lichens), its 'native climate' is dependent on the specific climate zone where its host lichens thrive, which can range from arctic to tropical biomes, encompassing diverse conditions such as temperate forests, arid regions, or alpine tundras. |
| **Sunlight** | As a fungus, Hawksworthiana U. Braun does not photosynthesize and therefore does not have 'sun requirements' like a plant. It typically grows on lichens, which may have light needs for their photosynthetic partner. |
| **Watering** | Fungi require moisture for growth, but 'watering frequency' as applied to plants is not relevant. Its moisture needs are met by the environment of its host lichen, often from humidity, dew, or rainfall absorbed by the lichen itself. |

## Care Guide
Hawksworthiana U. Braun is a fungus, specifically a lichenicolous fungus, not a plant. Therefore, conventional 'plant care' guidelines for sun, water, and fertilizer are not applicable. Its survival and growth depend entirely on the presence and health of its specific lichen host and the environmental conditions suitable for that host.

### Fertilizer
As a heterotrophic fungus, Hawksworthiana U. Braun obtains nutrients from its host lichen or decaying organic matter. It does not require fertilizer applications in the way plants do for soil enrichment.
