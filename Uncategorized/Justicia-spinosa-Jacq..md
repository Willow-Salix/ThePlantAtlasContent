| **Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest and Coastal Thickets |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to full sun. Tolerates direct afternoon sun in its native habitat, suggesting it can handle strong light conditions. |

## Care Guide
This tropical plant thrives in bright, sunny conditions and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native coastal thicket environment. Provide regular fertilization during the warmer growing months to support its vigorous growth, and ensure humidity levels are adequate.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to regular fertilization is suitable. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer), similar to nutrient availability in rich tropical soils from leaf litter. Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
