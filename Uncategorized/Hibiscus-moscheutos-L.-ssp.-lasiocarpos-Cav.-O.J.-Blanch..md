## Introduction
Hibiscus is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. The genus is quite large, comprising several hundred species that are native to warm temperate, subtropical and tropical regions throughout the world. Member species are renowned for their large, showy flowers and those species are commonly known simply as "hibiscus", or less widely known as rose mallow. The genus includes both annual and perennial herbaceous plants, as well as woody shrubs and small trees.
Several species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants, notably Hibiscus syriacus and Hibiscus × rosa-sinensis.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and consistently wet to boggy conditions, mimicking its native wetland habitat. Provide moderate to high fertility to support its vigorous growth, ensuring it has ample moisture throughout its active season.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high; benefits from regular feeding during the growing season to support vigorous growth, given the often rich but also dynamic nutrient environment of wetlands.
