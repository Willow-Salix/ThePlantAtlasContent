## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient grass thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native tropical grasslands and savannas. It requires moderate watering during its active growth period but exhibits good drought tolerance once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to less fertile soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season, but it is not a heavy feeder.
