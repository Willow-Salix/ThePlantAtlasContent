## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
Angustate Goldenrod thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring moderate watering but tolerating some drought once established. Minimal fertilization is required, as too many nutrients can promote excessive, leggy growth rather than robust blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; excessive fertilizer can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering
