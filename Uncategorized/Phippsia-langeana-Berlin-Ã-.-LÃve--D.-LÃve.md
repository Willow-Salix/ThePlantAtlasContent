## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic-alpine regions, including Svalbard (Norway), Greenland, and other high-latitude Northern Hemisphere areas |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, especially during its brief active growing season when exposed to high light intensity. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil during the short growing season, mimicking conditions from melting snow. Avoid prolonged waterlogging, particularly in cold or dormant periods. |

## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine grass is adapted to very cold, exposed environments. It requires full sun during its short active growing season and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Due to its native habitat, it needs minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Tundra soils are naturally nutrient-poor. If absolutely necessary, a highly diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once early in the brief growing season.
