## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, including the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands/Savannas |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in high light conditions common in open savannas and grasslands |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the topsoil to dry out completely between waterings. Tolerant of short dry periods reflecting its native wet and dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Zornia is a cosmopolitan genus of herbs from the legume family Fabaceae. It was recently assigned to the informal monophyletic Adesmia clade of the Dalbergieae. The genus Zornia comprises about 80 species, notable for its pantropical distribution

## Care Guide
Zornia, a resilient pantropical legume, flourishes in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soils typical of its native grasslands and savannas. It prefers moderate watering, letting the soil dry out between sessions, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. This makes it a relatively low-maintenance plant adapted to varying conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; as a legume, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen, reducing the need for high nitrogen fertilizers in its typically nutrient-moderate native soils.
