## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Savanna and Dry Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and abundant flowering, mimicking their open native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Regular and consistent watering during the active growing season (spring through fall), allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Reduce watering significantly during the dormant winter period, especially in cooler climates, to simulate natural dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Jacaranda is a genus of 49 species of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas while cultivated around the world. The generic name is also used as the common name.
The species Jacaranda mimosifolia has achieved a cosmopolitan distribution due to introductions, to the extent that it has entered popular culture. It can be found growing wild in Central America, the Caribbean, Spain, Portugal, southern and northern Africa, China, Australia, Rwanda and Cyprus.

## Care Guide
Jacarandas thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, preferring regular watering during their growing season and a drier period in winter. Fertilize lightly in spring, avoiding too much nitrogen to encourage their spectacular violet blooms.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in early spring or early summer. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote leafy growth at the expense of flowers. They are not heavy feeders in their native environment.
