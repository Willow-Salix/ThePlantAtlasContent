## Introduction
Aframomum is a genus of flowering plants in the ginger family, Zingiberaceae. It is widespread across tropical Africa as well as on some islands of the Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Seychelles, and Mauritius). It is represented by approximately 50 species. Its species are perennials and produce colorful flowers. Several aromatic species with essential oils present in fruits, seeds, leaves, stems, rhizomes, and other plant parts are either edible or used as medicine in Africa.
Aframomum melegueta (Melegueta pepper) is an economically important edible crop in West Africa.

## Care Guide
Aframomum thrives in warm, humid conditions with consistent soil moisture and indirect light, characteristic of tropical rainforests. Ensure well-draining, nutrient-rich soil and protect it from direct, intense sunlight.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding during the growing season with a balanced, slow-release or liquid fertilizer, due to the nutrient-rich organic matter found in its native habitat.
