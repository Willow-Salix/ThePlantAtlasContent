## Care Guide
To cultivate Hookeria Moss, replicate its native humid temperate forest environment by providing constant deep shade or very low indirect light, extremely high humidity, and a consistently moist substrate. Avoid direct sun and ensure good air circulation to prevent mold, while also preventing the moss from ever drying out.

### Fertilizer
Generally requires no fertilizer. Mosses absorb sufficient nutrients from their environment; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
