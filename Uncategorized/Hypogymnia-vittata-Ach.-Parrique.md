## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in temperate and boreal regions of North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains), Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coniferous/Mixed Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect or dappled light; avoid direct, intense sunlight which can lead to desiccation. Thrives in environments with filtered light similar to a forest understory or canopy. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity is crucial. Regular misting with distilled or rainwater is beneficial, as lichens absorb moisture directly from the air. Avoid prolonged periods of dryness, but also ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues. |

## Introduction
Hypogymnia is a genus of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. They are commonly known as tube lichens, bone lichens, or pillow lichens. Most species lack rhizines (root-like attachment organs on the lower surface) that are otherwise common in members of the Parmeliaceae, and have swollen lobes that are usually hollow. Other common characteristics are relatively small spores and the presence of physodic acid and related lichen products. The lichens usually grow on the bark and wood of coniferous trees.
Hypogymnia was proposed by lichenologist William Nylander, first as a subgenus of Parmelia in 1881, and 15 years later as a distinct genus of two species, including the widespread and common type species, Hypogymnia physodes. It has since grown to about 90 recognized species. Hypogymnia has a centre of biodiversity in China, where many of its species are found.

## Care Guide
The Vitt tube lichen thrives in cool, highly humid conditions with indirect or filtered light, mimicking its temperate forest origins. Provide consistent moisture through high ambient humidity and regular misting, avoiding direct sun and traditional fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and their substrate. Traditional fertilizers are generally not needed and can be harmful due to high salt content.
