## Care Guide
False Ironwort thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist soil, mimicking its tropical American origins. It is a robust plant that benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growing period to support its vigorous habit.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilizer needs. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer applied monthly during the growing season is generally sufficient given its vigorous growth in average soils.
