## Introduction
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun, Moss Verbena requires moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry out between sessions, especially once established due to its native drought tolerance. Fertilize sparingly to support its growth. This hardy plant is well-suited for open, sunny locations.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; apply a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer sparingly during the active growing season.
