## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable plant thrives in full sun with moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions. It requires minimal fertilization, as it is accustomed to poor to average soil conditions in its native, often disturbed, habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a pioneer species and weed, it thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and generally does not require supplemental feeding. Over-fertilization can promote excessive leafy growth.
