## 🌱 Overview
Geum , (Latinized Greek for "taste" referencing the roots of the plant) commonly called avens, is a genus of about 50 species of rhizomatous perennial herbaceous plants in the rose family and its subfamily Rosoideae which are widely distributed across Europe, Asia, North and South America, Africa, and New Zealand. They are closely related to Potentilla and Fragaria. From a basal rosette of leaves, they produce flowers on wiry stalks, in shades of white, red, yellow, and orange, in midsummer. Geum species are evergreen except where winter temperatures drop below 0 °F (−18 °C). The cultivar 'Mrs J. Bradshaw' (with orange flowers) has the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
Geum species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the grizzled skipper.
The UK National Collection of geums is held at Brickwall Cottage Garden and Nursery in Frittenden, Kent.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spring Avens flourishes in partial to full shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. It demands regular watering to prevent drying out and benefits from an annual application of compost to meet its moderate nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in organically rich soil. An annual top-dressing of compost or leaf mold is generally sufficient. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be used sparingly if soil is particularly poor, but heavy fertilization is not typically needed.
