## Care Guide
Stiffleaf Agalinis thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native wet prairie and pine flatwood environments. It is adapted to low to moderate soil fertility, often growing in sandy or peaty substrates.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it often grows in nutrient-poor sandy or peaty soils characteristic of its native habitats and is hemiparasitic.
