## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Florida, USA |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Pine Flatwoods, Sandhills) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring bright light exposure similar to its open pineland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the topsoil to dry completely between waterings, as it's adapted to well-drained sandy soils and tolerant of some drought. |

## Introduction
Chrysopsis (golden asters) are plants in the family Asteraceae native to the southern and eastern United States. All the species are found in Florida, although some are found in other states as well.
These are annual and perennial herbs bearing daisy-like flower heads with yellow disc florets and usually yellow ray florets. Some species formerly classified in this genus are now included in other genera: Heterotheca, Pityopsis, Stenotus, Ionactis, Aster, Eucephalus, Erigeron, Machaeranthera, Croptilon, Xanthisma, Oclemena, Bradburia, Oxypappus, Arnica, and Helichrysopsis.
Golden asters are often used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Schinia petulans (which feeds exclusively on C. subulata).

## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun to partial shade, Few-flowered Goldenaster requires well-drained, sandy soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor soils typical of its native environment, so minimal or no fertilization is generally needed.
