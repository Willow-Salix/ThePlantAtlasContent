## Introduction
The genus Scrophularia of the family Scrophulariaceae comprises about 200 species of herbaceous flowering plants commonly known as figworts. Species of Scrophularia all share square stems, opposite leaves and open two-lipped flowers forming clusters at the end of their stems. The genus is found throughout the Northern Hemisphere.
Scrophularia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Phymatopus hectoides.
Some species in this genus are known to contain potentially useful substances, such as iridoids, and several Scrophularia species, such as the Ningpo figwort (S. ningpoensis), have been used by herbal medicine practitioners around the world. The name Scrophularia comes from scrofula, a form of tuberculosis, because several species have been used in herbal medicine for this disease.

## Care Guide
Thriving in its native arid desert climate, the Desert Figwort requires full sun and excellent drainage. Mimic its natural environment by providing infrequent, deep waterings only after the soil has thoroughly dried, and keep fertilization to a minimum.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, during the growing season with a diluted, balanced fertilizer, especially if soil is very poor.
