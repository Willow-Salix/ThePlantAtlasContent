## Introduction
Pediomelum is a genus of legumes known as Indian breadroots. These are glandular perennial plants with palmately-arranged leaves. They have a main erect stem with inflorescences of blue or purple flowers and produce hairy legume pods containing beanlike seeds. Some species have woody roots while others have starchy tuber-like roots which can be eaten like tuber vegetables such as potatoes or made into flour. Indian breadroots are native to North America. Many species have synonymy with genus Psoralea.

## Care Guide
Rush Lemonweed is well-suited for full sun exposure and is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent deep watering. It requires minimal to no fertilizer, thriving in lean, well-draining soils typical of its native arid and semi-arid habitats.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it's a nitrogen-fixer and thrives in lean to poor soils.
