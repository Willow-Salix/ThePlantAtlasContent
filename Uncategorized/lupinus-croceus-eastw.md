## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Sierra Nevada foothills, California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland and Temperate Grassland (characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun (requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and flowering) |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the active growing season (spring), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring little to no supplemental water during its summer dormancy period. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Saffron-flowered Lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean habitat. Provide moderate water during its spring growth, ensuring soil dries out, and reduce significantly or withhold water during its summer dormancy. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no nitrogen fertilizer needed, as it is a legume and fixes its own nitrogen. If soil is poor, a low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus fertilizer can be applied sparingly in early spring.
