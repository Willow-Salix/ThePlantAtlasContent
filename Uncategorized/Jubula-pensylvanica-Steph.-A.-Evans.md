## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in a highly humid, deeply shaded environment, mimicking its native temperate forest floor habitat. Ensure constant moisture for its substrate and high ambient humidity, while avoiding direct sun and over-fertilization to prevent damage.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Bryophytes have very low nutrient requirements; if used, apply a highly diluted solution very sparingly.
