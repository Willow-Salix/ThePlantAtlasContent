## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its Mediterranean native climate. Water moderately during its active growth period in spring, then reduce significantly as summer heat arrives, as it is drought-tolerant. Avoid over-fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization is sufficient. It is adapted to relatively lean soils found in its natural habitat.
