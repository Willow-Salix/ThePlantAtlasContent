## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic bromeliad thrives in bright, indirect light and high humidity, mimicking its native tropical forest habitat. Provide frequent watering or misting, ensuring good air circulation for the plant to dry quickly to prevent rot. Fertilize lightly during the growing season with a diluted foliar feed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light foliar fertilization with a diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season.
