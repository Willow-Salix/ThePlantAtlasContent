## Introduction
Sphaeromeria is a genus of flowering plants in the chamomile tribe within the sunflower family.
Sphaeromeria is native to the western United States and northwestern Mexico. Species are known generally as chickensages. The genus is closely related to Artemisia, and some authors merge the two genera into one.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires very little water, adapting to arid, desert-like conditions. Ensure excellent drainage and provide minimal to no fertilizer to mimic its native habitat. It is a highly drought-tolerant species.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. Native soils in arid regions are typically low in organic matter. If grown in cultivation, a very light, balanced fertilizer application once a year in spring may be tolerated, but avoid over-fertilizing.
