## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (widespread across Canada and northern USA, extending south through the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian Mountains) |
| **Climate** | Temperate and Boreal Forest Wetlands / Riparian Zones |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. It often grows in open areas or forest edges along water bodies, receiving significant light. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil and is tolerant of saturated conditions, mimicking its native habitat along stream banks, swamps, and wet meadows. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
The Long-beaked Willow thrives in consistently moist to wet soil conditions and prefers full sun to partial shade. Adapted to wetland and riparian environments of North America, it requires minimal fertilization, especially in organically rich soils, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in naturally rich, organic soils typical of wetlands; supplemental fertilization is usually not heavily required if soil is adequate.
