| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains, Great Plains, Intermountain West of the United States and Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Steppe/Semi-Arid Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is ideal, reflecting its open habitat in grasslands and disturbed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, accustomed to areas with seasonal moisture and dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Descurainia is a genus of plants in the family Brassicaceae which are known commonly as the tansymustards. The genus name commemorates French botanist and herbalist François Descurain (1658–1749). The plants are similar in appearance to other mustards, sending up long erect stems and bearing small yellow or whitish flowers. Many species are noxious weeds. Some species are toxic to livestock and become a nuisance when they grow in grazing fields. Plants of this genus are found worldwide in temperate regions. Descurainia sophia, (flixweed or herb sophia), is the type species of Descurainia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Intermediate Tansymustard is a low-maintenance plant that flourishes in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its semi-arid grassland origins. It requires infrequent watering, being highly drought-tolerant, and thrives without significant fertilization due to its adaptation to lean nutrient environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. This plant is adapted to thrive in average to poor, lean soils typical of its native habitat.
