## Care Guide
The Sandbar Willow is a water-loving plant native to riparian zones, requiring abundant moisture and full to partial sun exposure. It thrives in consistently wet soil and can tolerate temporary flooding, mimicking its natural habitat along rivers and streams. Minimal fertilization is typically needed if growing conditions are otherwise suitable.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not a heavy feeder. Benefits from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer in early spring if soil is poor, but often thrives without significant fertilization.
