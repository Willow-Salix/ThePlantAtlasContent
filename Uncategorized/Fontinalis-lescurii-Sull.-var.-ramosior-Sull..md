## Care Guide
This aquatic moss thrives when fully submerged in cool, clear, and oxygenated freshwater, preferring low to moderate indirect light. Minimal fertilization is required as it absorbs nutrients directly from the water. Ensure stable water conditions and avoid strong direct light to prevent algal overgrowth.

### Fertilizer
Low. Absorbs nutrients from the water column. Over-fertilization can promote algae growth.
