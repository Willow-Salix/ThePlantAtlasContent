## Care Guide
Denseflower Evening Primrose is a resilient desert native that requires full sun and excellent drainage. Water sparingly, only when the soil is completely dry, and avoid over-fertilizing as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; it thrives in lean, well-draining soils typical of its native habitat.
