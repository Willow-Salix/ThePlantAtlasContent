## 🌱 Overview
Eryngium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. There are about 250 species. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, with centres of diversity in the western Mediterranean, South America and Mexico. Common names include eryngo and sea holly (though not to be confused with true hollies, of the genus Ilex).
These are annual and perennial herbs with hairless and usually spiny leaves. The dome-shaped umbels of steely blue or white flowers have whorls of spiny basal bracts. European and Asian species tend to be native to dry, rocky and coastal areas, and the American species are native to often damp grasslands.
In the language of flowers, they represent admiration.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, well-draining sandy soils, reflecting its native pine flatwoods and sandhill habitats. It requires moderate watering but tolerates dry periods once established, with minimal need for fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils; excessive fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental. A very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer once a year, if at all, is sufficient.
