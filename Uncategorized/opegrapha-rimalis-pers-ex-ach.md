## 🌱 Overview
Opegrapha is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Opegraphaceae. These lichens form crusty patches on bark, rock, or other lichens, and are easily recognized by their distinctive black, slit-like or rounded fruiting bodies that look like tiny scribbles or dashes on the surface. The genus includes more than 100 species found worldwide, with most partnering with orange-pigmented green algae, though some live as parasites on other lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a lichen, Opegrapha rimalis thrives in environments with high humidity and consistent moisture, preferring indirect or dappled light. It obtains all necessary water and nutrients directly from the atmosphere and its substrate, thus requiring no traditional watering or fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air, precipitation, and their substrate.
