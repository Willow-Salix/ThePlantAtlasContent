## Introduction
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## Care Guide
This annual grass is relatively low-maintenance, preferring full sun to partial shade and moderate watering during its growth cycle. It thrives in various soil types and generally does not require intensive fertilization, making it quite adaptable.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typically does not require heavy fertilization, but a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer can be applied once in spring if soil fertility is low.
