## Introduction
Abutilon  is a large genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia. General common names include Indian mallow and velvetleaf; ornamental varieties may be known as room maple, parlor maple, or flowering maple.
The genus name is an 18th-century Neo-Latin word that came from the Arabic ’abū-ṭīlūn (أبو طيلون),  the name given by Avicenna to this or a similar genus.
The type species is Abutilon theophrasti. Several species formerly placed in Abutilon, including the cultivated species and hybrids commonly known as "flowering maples", have recently (2012, 2014) been transferred to the new genus Callianthe.

## Care Guide
The Sonora Abutilon is a desert-adapted plant thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. It requires infrequent watering due to its high drought tolerance, making it an excellent low-maintenance choice for arid gardens. Fertilization should be minimal, if at all.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season may be beneficial, but often not necessary in suitable soil.
