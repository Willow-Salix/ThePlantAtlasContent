## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern North America, particularly the Ozark Mountains region (Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas), extending east through states like Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodlands and Prairies, specifically rocky glades, open slopes, and bluff ledges within a humid subtropical climate. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun in cooler climates or morning sun with afternoon shade in hotter regions, thriving in open, exposed locations. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the topsoil to dry out slightly between waterings. It requires excellent drainage and can tolerate short dry spells once established, reflecting its rocky native habitat. |

## Care Guide
Green Rockcress flourishes in full sun to partial shade with well-draining, lean soil, mimicking its native rocky glade habitat. Water moderately, letting the soil dry between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in lean, well-draining, and often rocky soils. Minimal to no fertilization is required; excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
