## Introduction
Anredera is a genus of plants native to Latin America, the West Indies, Texas, and Florida. Some are naturalized in other regions (notably Mediterranean region and on various oceanic islands). Most of them evergreen vines of dry scrubland and thickets. Members of the genus are commonly known as Madeira vines. At least one species, A. cordifolia, bears edible roots or tubers and leaves similar to those of Basella alba. The same species has become an invasive plant in many tropical and subtropical regions outside its natural range.

## Care Guide
This vigorous tropical vine thrives in bright, humid conditions, preferring consistent moisture and regular feeding during its active growth. Provide a sturdy support structure to accommodate its climbing habit and ensure good air circulation.

### Fertilizer
Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer).
