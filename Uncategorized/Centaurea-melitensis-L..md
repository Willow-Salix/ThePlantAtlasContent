## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin (Southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East), including countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, Malta, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Israel, and Turkey. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters), often categorized as Chaparral or Sclerophyllous Shrubland. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, tolerating intense and prolonged sun exposure typical of its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Mimic its native climate by providing more moisture during cooler, wetter periods (e.g., autumn/winter) and very little during hot, dry summers. |

## Introduction
Centaurea melitensis (called Maltese star-thistle in Europe, tocalote or tocolote in western North America) is an annual plant in the family Asteraceae, 1 to 11 decimetres (4 to 43 in) high, with resin-dotted leaves and spine-tipped phyllaries. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region of Europe and Africa. It was introduced to North America in the 18th century; the first documented occurrence in California is in the adobe of a building constructed in San Fernando in 1797. It is also naturalized on a number of Pacific islands.

## Care Guide
The Maltese Star-thistle thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established due to its drought-tolerant nature. It prefers infrequent, deep watering, especially during dry periods, and has low fertilizer needs, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required. This plant is adapted to poor to moderately fertile soils and can thrive without supplemental feeding. If soil is extremely poor, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be considered.
