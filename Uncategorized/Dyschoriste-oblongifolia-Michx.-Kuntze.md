## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, North Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (typically found in pine flatwoods, sandhills, and open woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring open, exposed areas similar to its native habitat under a relatively open tree canopy or in clearings. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, keeping soil consistently moist but ensuring excellent drainage. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot, especially in sandy soils. |

## Care Guide
To care for Oblongleaf Snakeherb, provide full sun to partial shade conditions and ensure well-draining soil, mimicking its native pine flatwood and sandhill environments. Water regularly to keep the soil moist but avoid waterlogging, allowing the top layer to dry between waterings. Fertilization needs are low; a light application during the growing season is generally adequate.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, particularly in sandy or less fertile soils.
