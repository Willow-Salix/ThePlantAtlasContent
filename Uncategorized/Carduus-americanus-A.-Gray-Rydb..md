## Introduction
Carduus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, and the tribe Cardueae, one of two genera considered to be true thistles, the other being Cirsium. Plants of the genus are known commonly as plumeless thistles. They are native to temperate Eurasia and North Africa, and several are known elsewhere as introduced species. This genus is noted for its disproportionately high number of noxious weeds compared to other flowering plant genera.

## Care Guide
This thistle prefers temperate mountain conditions, requiring ample sunlight and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Ensure good drainage and provide moderate watering, especially during its active growth. An annual application of organic matter or a balanced fertilizer will support its vigor.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Naturally grows in rich, often organic, well-draining soils. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost amendment applied once in spring will support healthy growth.
