## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central Valley of California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Seasonal Wetlands (Vernal Pools) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, as it grows in open, unshaded vernal pools. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture, often standing water, throughout its active growing season (winter and spring); tolerates or requires dry conditions for dormancy and seed maturation in summer. |

## Introduction
Downingia is a genus of 13 annual plants native to western North America and Chile. Commonly known as calico flowers, they are notable for forming mass displays of small but colorful blooms around vernal pools. A number are uncommon endemics in California.
The stems may be decumbent or erect, 10–40 cm in length, with narrow cauline leaves that may drop off before the flower develops. The flowers are typically inverted by the twisting of the ovary during blooming. Colors range from blue and pink to white, with the lower (larger) lip including a white or yellow patch. The lower lip generally consists of three lobes, while the upper lip is much smaller and has two lobes.
The genus is named after American horticulturalist A. J. Downing (1815-1852).

## Care Guide
This annual thrives in full sun and demands constant moisture, even standing water, during its growth period in cooler months. It prefers lean soils and should be allowed to dry completely after flowering to mimic its natural summer dormancy for seed maturation.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilizer needs, as it naturally occurs in nutrient-poor, ephemeral wetland soils.
