# Sandwort

*Arenaria L.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America; often found in mountainous, rocky, or open sandy habitats. |
| **Climate** | Temperate, Subalpine, Alpine Tundra, Subarctic. Characterized by cool to cold winters, moderate summers, and well-drained, often lean soils. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Most species thrive in open, bright locations, common in their native rocky and alpine environments where canopy cover is minimal. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist but very well-drained soil, allowing it to dry out slightly between waterings. Intolerant of waterlogging, reflecting its native sandy/rocky habitats. |

## Care Guide
Sandworts require well-drained soil, full to partial sun, and moderate watering, ensuring the soil dries between applications to prevent rot. They are adapted to lean soils, so minimal fertilization is needed.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Native to often lean, nutrient-poor soils, so a light application of balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, or none if soil is already reasonably fertile, is sufficient.
