## Introduction
Pohlia is a genus of mosses in the family Mniaceae, found on all continents including Antarctica. Some of its species are native to multiple continents. The center of diversity is the Northern Hemisphere.
The genus name of Pohlia is in honour of Johann Ehrenfried Pohl (1746–1800), who was a German physician and botanist. 
The genus was circumscribed by Johann Hedwig in Descriptio et Adumbratio microscopio-analytica Muscorum
Frondosorum vol.1 on page 98 in 1785-1787.

## Care Guide
Tozer's Pohlia flourishes in consistently damp, shaded to partially shaded conditions, mirroring its natural habitat along temperate streams and ditches. It requires very little to no supplemental fertilization and thrives when its substrate remains continuously moist with good ambient humidity.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed; mosses absorb nutrients efficiently from their environment.
