## Care Guide
This large juniper thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its arid to semi-arid montane native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and very little fertilization to prosper. Ensure excellent drainage and ample sunlight for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, typically in early spring with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer only if growth appears stunted.
