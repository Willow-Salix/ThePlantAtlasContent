## 🌱 Overview
Gentiana () is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the gentian family (Gentianaceae), the tribe Gentianeae, and the monophyletic subtribe Gentianinae. With over 300 species, it is considered a large genus. Gentians are notable for their mostly large trumpet-shaped flowers, which are often of an intense blue hue, though some are also bright yellow. The type species of the genus is Gentiana lutea.
The genus name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king who may have discovered tonic properties in gentians.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Tioga Gentian thrives in conditions that emulate its native alpine meadows, requiring full sun, consistently moist yet well-drained soil, and cool summer temperatures. Ensure ample moisture during growth, but strict drainage is paramount to prevent rot, particularly when dormant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers lean to moderately fertile soil. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, but avoid over-fertilization which can hinder flowering.
