## Care Guide
Texas Wildrye is a hardy native grass adapted to its namesake state's climate. Provide full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, watering sparingly once established as it is drought-tolerant. Avoid excessive fertilization to maintain its natural resilience.

### Fertilizer
Prefers lean to moderately fertile soils and typically does not require heavy fertilization; over-fertilization can reduce hardiness.
