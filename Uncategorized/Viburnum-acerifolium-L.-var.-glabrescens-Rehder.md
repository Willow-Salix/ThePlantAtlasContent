## Introduction
Viburnum is a genus of about 150–175 species of flowering plants in the moschatel family, Adoxaceae or its alternative name Viburnaceae. Its current classification is based on molecular phylogeny. It was previously included in the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae.
The member species are evergreen or deciduous shrubs or (in a few cases) small trees native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species extending into tropical montane regions in South America and southeast Asia. In Africa, the genus is confined to the Atlas Mountains.

## Care Guide
Mapleleaf Viburnum thrives in the dappled light and consistently moist, well-drained soils found in its native temperate deciduous forest understory. Provide regular moisture, avoiding soggy conditions, and a light annual feeding to support its growth. Ensure protection from harsh afternoon sun to prevent leaf scorch.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization in early spring with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or an annual application of compost, reflecting the moderately rich soils of forest floors.
