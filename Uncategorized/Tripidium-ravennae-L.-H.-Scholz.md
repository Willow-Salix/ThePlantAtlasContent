## Introduction
Tripidium is a genus of flowering plant in the Poaceae (or grass) family of plants. The genus is native to southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia with the native distribution of genus extending from the western parts of Mediterranean (including Spain and Morocco) and Western Sahara, to the Korean peninsula and the island of New Guinea at the eastern-most extent of its distribution.
The genus name was first published by Hildemar Wolfgang Scholz in 2006 as a replacement for the illegitimate name Ripidium.
