## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains, Alaska, Canada), Northern Europe (e.g., Fennoscandia) |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate and Boreal Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun, tolerating some direct morning or late afternoon sun in cooler conditions. Avoid harsh midday sun and excessive heat. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity, often found in areas with frequent rainfall, fog, or dew. In cultivation, regular misting and placement in a humid environment are crucial to prevent desiccation. |

## Care Guide
Fuscidea Lichen thrives in cool, moist environments typical of boreal and temperate montane regions. Provide bright, indirect light and maintain high atmospheric humidity through regular misting to mimic its natural habitat. Avoid any form of traditional fertilization, as it is unnecessary and harmful to these unique organisms.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens do not require traditional fertilization, and most fertilizers can be detrimental.
