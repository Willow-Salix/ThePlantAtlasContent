## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Africa, specifically sandy or coastal regions (inferred based on botanist J. Burtt Davy's work and the species epithet 'arenicola') |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Grassland/Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive in its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water infrequently but deeply, allowing the sandy soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic natural rainfall patterns. |

## Care Guide
This grass, likely from the semi-arid sandy regions of Southern Africa, requires full sun and is highly drought-tolerant. It thrives with minimal watering once established and tolerates lean soils, making it a low-maintenance plant adapted to harsh, open environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; its native sandy soils are often lean. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring is sufficient, or none if growth is vigorous.
