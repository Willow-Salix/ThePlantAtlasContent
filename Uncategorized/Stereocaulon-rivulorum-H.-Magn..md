| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Alpine regions (e.g., Scandinavia, Greenland, Alaska, Arctic Canada, Siberia) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High light, often direct and prolonged during active periods, characteristic of open tundra environments. |
| **Watering** | Frequent moisture from snowmelt or precipitation when active; tolerant of dry dormancy periods or freezing. |

## Introduction
Stereocaulon is a genus of lichens. Members of Stereocaulon are commonly called rock foam lichens. Photobiont partners of Stereocaulon include green algae from the genera Asterochloris, Chloroidium, and Vulcanochloris. Stereocaulon is difficult to ID to species, but there is a high diversity of species within the genus.

## Care Guide
Snow lichen thrives in the high light conditions of alpine and arctic tundras, often near snowmelt. It requires consistent moisture during active growth but is well-adapted to periods of dryness or freezing. Nutrient needs are extremely low, reflecting its native, impoverished environment.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low; requires minimal to no supplemental fertilizer as native environments are nutrient-poor.
