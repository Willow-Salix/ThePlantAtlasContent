## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Specific information for 'Limodorum parviflorum (Lindl.) Nash' is unavailable. Based on Limodorum abortivum (the sole accepted species in the genus), it is native to the Mediterranean region, including Southern and Central Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Specific climate data for 'Limodorum parviflorum (Lindl.) Nash' is unavailable. Based on Limodorum abortivum, it thrives in Mediterranean climate zones, typically within temperate woodlands and scrublands. |
| **☀️ Light** | Based on Limodorum abortivum, it requires partial shade to dappled sun, preferring protection from intense afternoon sun, typical of understory conditions in woodlands. |
| **💧 Water** | Based on Limodorum abortivum, moderate watering is needed during its active growth period in cooler, wetter months (autumn to spring). It requires very little to no water during its summer dormancy, mimicking natural Mediterranean rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Limodorum is a genus of myco-heterotrophic orchids. All species are temperate terrestrial plants and occur across much of Europe, North-West Africa, the Mediterranean Islands, and as far east as Iran.  Plants have evolved away from photosynthesis and as a result their leaves are reduced to scales. There is still chlorophyll present but the plants are believed to be solely dependent on their fungal partner for nutrients. They spend most of their life underground as a short stem with fleshy roots, the unbranched inflorescence can appear in April to June if conditions are favourable. 
The name finds its origin in "haemodoron", first applied by Theophrastus and later adopted by Jacques Daléchamps to refer to parasitic plants most likely in Orobanche.  The name is derived from the Greek “leimo-” (meadow) and “dōron,” (gift).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As 'Limodorum parviflorum (Lindl.) Nash' is not a recognized botanical name, care instructions are inferred from Limodorum abortivum. This highly specialized, mycoheterotrophic orchid is exceptionally difficult to cultivate, requiring specific fungal associations, partial shade, and a Mediterranean watering regime with a dry summer dormancy.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Based on Limodorum abortivum, conventional fertilization is not applicable due to its mycoheterotrophic nature. It relies entirely on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making cultivation extremely challenging.
