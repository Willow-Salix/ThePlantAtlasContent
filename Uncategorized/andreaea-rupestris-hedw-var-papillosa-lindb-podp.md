## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Alpine regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including mountainous areas of Scandinavia, Greenland, North America, and the European Alps. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, and cold Montane environments. |
| **☀️ Light** | High light exposure, tolerating full sun in cool, humid environments; partial shade can be beneficial in warmer conditions to prevent desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist, mimicking frequent snowmelt or rain, but ensure excellent drainage. Avoid prolonged periods of complete dryness. |

## 🌱 Overview
Andreaea is a genus of rock mosses described by Johann Hedwig in 1801.
They are small, delicate acrocarpous mosses (meaning that the capsules are formed at the tips of vertical branches) that form dark brown or reddish cushions on wet siliceous rocks in mountainous areas. The capsule lacks the peristome teeth and operculum of other mosses, and opens by splitting along 4 vertical slits, the four valves remaining joined at the base and apex. The capsule of Andreaea has no seta, but the sporophyte (Spf in the diagram below) instead is supported by a pseudopodium (ps) derived from gametophyte tissue, as in Sphagnum and the columella is enclosed within the sporangium. The spores germinate to give thalloid protonemata.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rock-dwelling moss thrives in cold, high-light environments with consistent moisture and excellent drainage. Mimic its native alpine/arctic climate by providing high light exposure and keeping the substrate consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Avoid heavy fertilization as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required; high nutrient levels can be detrimental as it is adapted to nutrient-poor rocky substrates.
