| **🌍 Origin** | Southern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas), Mexico, Central America, and northern South America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Dry Forest, Savanna, Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) to thrive, reflecting its natural habitat in open, exposed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; requires moderate watering during active growth periods, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly during dormant or dry seasons. |

## 🌱 Overview
Acacia, commonly known as wattles or acacias, is a genus of about 1,084 species of shrubs and trees in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the pea family Fabaceae. Initially, it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa, South America, and Australasia, but is now reserved for species mainly from Australia, with others from New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. The genus name is Neo-Latin, borrowed from Koine Greek ἀκακία (akakia), a term used in antiquity to describe a preparation extracted from Vachellia nilotica, the original type species.
Several species of Acacia have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its native open habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, with less water needed during dormancy. Nutrient needs are low to moderate, with a light application of balanced fertilizer during its growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once or twice during the growing season is generally sufficient, as it naturally grows in soils that are not overly rich.
