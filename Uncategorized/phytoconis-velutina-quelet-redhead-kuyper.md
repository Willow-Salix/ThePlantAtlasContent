## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe and North America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Forests, characterized by high humidity and moderate temperatures |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light. This lichen is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas of forests, growing on tree bark or mossy rocks, and is sensitive to direct, intense sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and consistent moisture from rain, dew, or mist. It absorbs water directly from the air and its substrate, rather than through roots. Avoid prolonged periods of dryness, but also ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal growth. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lichenomphalia is both a basidiolichen and an agaric genus. Most of the species have inconspicuous lichenized thalli that consist of scattered, small, loose, nearly microscopic green balls or foliose small flakes containing single-celled green algae in the genus Coccomyxa, all interconnected by a loose network of hyphae. The agaric fruit bodies themselves are nonlichenized and resemble other types of omphalinoid mushrooms. These agarics lack clamp connections and do not form hymenial cystidia. The basidiospores are hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, and nonamyloid. Most of the species were originally classified in the genera Omphalina or Gerronema. Historically the species were classified with those other genera in the family, the Tricholomataceae together with the nonlichenized species. Lichenomphalia species can be grouped into brightly colored taxa, with vivid yellow and orange colors, versus the grey brown group, depending upon the microscopic pigmentation deposits. Molecular research comparing DNA sequences now place Lichenomphalia close to the redefined genus Arrhenia, which together with several other genera not traditionally considered to be related, fall within the newly redefined Hygrophoraceae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a lichen, Phytoconis velutina thrives in cool, humid environments with consistent indirect light, mimicking its temperate forest origins. It depends on atmospheric moisture and clean air for survival, requiring no traditional watering or fertilizers. Maintaining high ambient humidity is crucial for its well-being.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens are self-sufficient in nutrient acquisition from the atmosphere and their substrate; traditional fertilizers can be detrimental.
