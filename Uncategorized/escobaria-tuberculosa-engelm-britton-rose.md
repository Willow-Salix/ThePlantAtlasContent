## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus demands abundant direct sunlight and extremely well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Water sparingly, only when the soil is thoroughly dry, and provide minimal fertilization. Ensure a dry dormancy period in winter.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; a diluted, low-nitrogen fertilizer formulated for cacti and succulents can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring to early summer).
