## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical Asia, particularly Southeast Asia (e.g., Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, China) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest / Tropical Monsoon Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to bright indirect light. As understory plants, they thrive with dappled light and should be protected from harsh, direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged during the active growing season, reflecting high rainfall. Reduce watering significantly during any dormant period. Good drainage is essential. |

## Introduction
Kaempferia is a genus of plants in the ginger family. It is native to China, India, and Southeast Asia.
The genus is named after the naturalist and traveller Engelbert Kaempfer, who lived in Japan and east Asia for the years 1689-1693 and was one of the first Europeans to write detailed descriptions of plants there.

## Care Guide
Kaempferia requires conditions mimicking its native tropical forest understory: bright indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil during active growth. Provide moderate fertilization and high humidity, while significantly reducing water during its dormant phase.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to regular feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring through fall), benefiting from the rich organic matter typical of forest floors.
