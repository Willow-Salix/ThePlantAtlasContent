| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern Australia (Victorian high country, e.g., Omeo region) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate / Subalpine, often in wet or marshy areas, experiencing cold winters with snow and cool, moist summers. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. Requires ample light, consistent with its growth in open subalpine woodlands. |

## 🌱 Overview
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Eucalyptus neglecta requires a location with full sun and consistently wet or very moist soil to mimic its native subalpine swampy environment. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to low-nutrient conditions. It is also highly tolerant of cold, wet climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor soils; use a low-phosphorus, slow-release fertilizer sparingly, primarily for young plants or if nutrient deficiency is apparent.
