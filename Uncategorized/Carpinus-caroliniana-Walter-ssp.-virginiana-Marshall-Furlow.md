## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, including the eastern United States and southeastern Canada |
| **Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forest (Humid Continental and Humid Subtropical) |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in partial shade (dappled light) to full sun, with partial shade preferred in hotter climates or when young as it often grows as an understory tree. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular watering is essential, especially during dry periods, mimicking the consistent moisture found on forest floors and stream banks. |

## Introduction
Carpinus caroliniana, the  American hornbeam, is a small hardwood understory tree in the genus Carpinus. American hornbeam is also known as blue-beech, ironwood, musclewood and muscle beech for the distinctive sinewy, muscle-like appearance of its trunk. It is native to eastern North America, from Minnesota to southern Quebec, east to Maine, and south to eastern Texas and northern Florida. It occurs in shaded areas with moist soil, particularly near the banks of streams or rivers, and is often a natural understory species of the riverine and maritime forests of eastern temperate North America.

## Care Guide
The American Hornbeam thrives in conditions similar to its native temperate forest understory. Provide partial shade to full sun, ensuring consistently moist, well-drained, and organically rich soil. Regular watering during dry spells and an annual compost application will promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from organically rich soil. An annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can support its growth, reflecting the nutrient cycling in its native deciduous forest habitat.
