## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona) and Mexico, extending into parts of Central America. |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid scrubland to montane woodlands with hot, dry summers and mild winters. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for optimal growth, especially when grown outside the warmest parts of its native range. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires excellent drainage. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering. |

## Introduction
Arbutus xalapensis, commonly known as the Texas madrone, Amazaquitl, or Texas madroño, is a species of flowering plant in the heather family. It is native to Central America, the southwestern United States (western Texas and New Mexico), and throughout Mexico. It is found in canyons and mountains, on rocky plains, and in oak woodlands, at altitudes of up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft) in the south of the range, but lower, down to 600 m (2,000 ft) in the north of the range.
Arbutus xalapensis is a large shrub or small to medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 5–25 meters (16–82 ft) tall with a trunk up to 50 cm (20 in) in diameter, with smooth orange-brown bark peeling in thin sheets. The size varies regionally with available rainfall, with small, shrubby plants in dry areas such as western Texas and New Mexico, and larger trees in moister areas of Mexico; plants in Texas, New Mexico, and the far northeast of Mexico are distinguished as a variety, A. xalapensis var. texana, or even a distinct species A. texana, by some botanists, but others do not regard these as distinct.
The leaves are oblong to lanceolate, 5–17 cm (2.0–6.7 in) long and 1.5–5 cm (0.59–1.97 in) broad, with an entire or serrated margin. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, 5–10 mm long, produced in loose panicles. The fruit is a rough-surfaced red berry 1 cm (0.39 in) in diameter, reportedly edible (however, those of related species have narcotic properties), and contains numerous small seeds.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native semi-arid and montane habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent deep watering and little to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in lean, well-drained, rocky, and often alkaline to neutral soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
