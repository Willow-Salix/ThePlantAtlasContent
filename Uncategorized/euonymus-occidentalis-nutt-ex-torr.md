## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Western Burning Bush, provide a consistently moist, shaded environment that mimics its native riparian habitat. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry periods, and offer moderate fertilization to support its growth. Protect the plant from harsh, direct afternoon sun.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertility. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or a top dressing of organic compost in spring will support healthy growth, as native soils are typically rich in organic matter.
