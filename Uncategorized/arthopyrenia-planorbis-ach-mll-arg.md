## 🌱 Overview
Arthopyrenia is a genus of fungi in the family Trypetheliaceae. It was formerly classified in the eponymic family Arthopyreniaceae, but molecular phylogenetics studies showed that the type species, Arthopyrenia cerasi, was a member of the Trypetheliaceae. Arthopyrenia fungi typically form inconspicuous films embedded within tree bark and produce tiny, flask-shaped fruiting bodies covered by dark, shield-like caps. The genus includes both lichen-forming species (those that partner with algae) and non-lichenized species, with about 100 currently recognized species found primarily on bark and wood substrates.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in humid, temperate forest environments, the Shell Lichen requires filtered light and high ambient humidity. Ensure regular misting or exposure to moisture, allowing for brief dry periods. Conventional fertilizers are not needed and can be harmful.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not generally required. Lichens obtain nutrients from air and rain; conventional fertilizers can be detrimental.
