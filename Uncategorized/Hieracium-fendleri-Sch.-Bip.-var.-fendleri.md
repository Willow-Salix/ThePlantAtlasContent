## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah) and northern Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine Woodlands and Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers brighter conditions, especially at higher elevations where it naturally occurs. |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent moisture, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot, mimicking its natural habitat's drainage. |

## Introduction
Pilosella caespitosa (synonym Hieracium caespitosum, commonly known as meadow hawkweed, yellow hawkweed,
field hawkweed, king devil, yellow paintbrush, devil's paintbrush, yellow devil, yellow fox-and-cubs, and yellow king-devil)

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in sunny to partly shaded locations with consistent, moderate moisture and well-drained soil, mimicking its native montane habitats. It requires minimal fertilization, benefiting most from good soil structure and occasional light feeding. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or organic matter can be applied sparingly, especially in spring, as montane soils are not excessively rich.
