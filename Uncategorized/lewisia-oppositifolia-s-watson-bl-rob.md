## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern Oregon and northwestern California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane / Subalpine |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers bright morning sun with some afternoon shade in hotter climates to prevent scorching. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the spring growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Requires excellent drainage, especially during winter dormancy, to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lewisia is a plant genus, named for the American explorer Meriwether Lewis (1774-1809) who encountered the species in 1806. The native habitat of Lewisia species is rocky ground and cliffs in western North America. Native Americans ate the roots, which have also been used to treat sore throats.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Oppositeleaf Lewisia thrives in conditions mimicking its temperate montane habitat, requiring full sun to partial shade and exceptional drainage. Water moderately during its active growth, ensuring the soil dries between waterings, and avoid rich soils or heavy fertilization to maintain its health and bloom.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Native to nutrient-poor, rocky soils, so no regular fertilization is typically needed. If desired, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
