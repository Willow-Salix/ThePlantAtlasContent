## Introduction
Lespedeza is a genus of some 45 species (including nothospecies) of flowering plants in the pea family (Fabaceae), commonly known as bush clovers or (particularly East Asian species) Japanese clovers (hagi). The genus is native to warm temperate to subtropical regions of eastern North America, eastern and southern Asia and Australasia.
These shrubby plants or trailing vines belong to the "typical" legumes (Faboideae), with the peas and beans, though they are part of another tribe, the Desmodieae. Therein, they are treated as type genus of the smaller subtribe Lespedezinae, which unites the present genus and its presumed closest relatives, Campylotropis and Kummerowia.

## Care Guide
Nuttall's Bush Clover is a low-maintenance plant thriving in temperate zones with full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering and, being a nitrogen-fixer, has very low fertilizer needs. This makes it a robust choice for naturalized areas or gardens with average soil.

### Fertilizer
Low (as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires minimal fertilization, if any, in average soils).
