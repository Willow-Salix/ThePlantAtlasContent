## Introduction
Leptogium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Collemataceae. It has about 110 species. Species formerly classified under Leptogium have since been divided among the genera Leptogium, Pseudoleptogium, and Scytinium. Leptogium lichens are predominantly found on tree bark or soil, often among mosses, and sometimes on rocks in moist environments.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in consistently moist, humid environments, preferring low to partial indirect light and protection from direct sun. Ensure high ambient humidity and frequent moisture through misting or natural rainfall, but avoid waterlogging. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it absorbs nutrients from the air and its substrate.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; derives nutrients primarily from the air, rainwater, and its substrate.
