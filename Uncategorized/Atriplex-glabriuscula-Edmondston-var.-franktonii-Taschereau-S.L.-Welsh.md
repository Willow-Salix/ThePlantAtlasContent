| **Climate** | Temperate Coastal (Dunes and Salt Marshes) |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily). Thrives in open, unsheltered coastal environments. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Tolerates dry coastal conditions and occasional salt spray. |

## Introduction
Atriplex () is a plant genus of about 250 species, known by the common names of saltbush and orache (; also spelled orach). It belongs to the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae s.l.. 
The genus is quite variable and widely distributed. It includes many desert and seashore plants and halophytes, as well as plants of moist environments. 
The generic name originated in Latin and was applied by Pliny the Elder to the edible oraches. The name saltbush derives from the fact that the plants retain salt in their leaves; they are able to grow in areas affected by soil salination.

## Care Guide
Frankton's Saltbush is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining, nutrient-poor soils. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established. Avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to low-nutrient coastal environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy or saline soils. Fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental; if needed, use a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly.
