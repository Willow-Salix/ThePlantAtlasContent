| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (California, Oregon) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate / Chaparral |

## 🌱 Overview
Brodiaea , also known by the common name cluster-lilies, is a monocot genus of flowering plants.
One school of thought places the genus in the family Themidaceae, while another school of thought places it in the subfamily Brodiaeoideae of the family Asparagaceae.  The USDA Plants Database still classifies the genus Brodiaea in the family Liliaceae.
Brodiaea species occur along the Pacific Coast region of North America, from British Columbia throughout California into the Baja California Peninsula. They are especially common in northern California.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native Mediterranean habitat. Provide consistent moisture during its active growth in cooler months, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and ensure a dry dormancy period in summer. Fertilization is generally minimal, supporting its resilience in moderate soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied once in early spring during active growth, but generally not critical in typical garden soils.
