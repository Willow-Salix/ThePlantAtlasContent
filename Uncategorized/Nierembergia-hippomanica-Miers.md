| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and abundant flowering, reflecting its open grassland native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture, especially during the growing season, but good drainage is crucial. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch, similar to moderate rainfall patterns in its native climate. |

## Care Guide
Dwarf Cupflower thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, native to the temperate grasslands of South America. Provide consistent watering to maintain soil moisture, allowing the top layer to dry between waterings, and feed lightly to encourage abundant flowering throughout the season.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from light to moderate feeding during its active growth and flowering period. A balanced liquid fertilizer applied every 2-4 weeks will support continuous blooming, consistent with moderately fertile grassland soils.
