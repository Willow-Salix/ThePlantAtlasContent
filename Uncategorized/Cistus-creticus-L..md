| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, including Southern Europe (e.g., Greece, Crete, Italy, Spain, France), North Africa, and parts of Western Asia (e.g., Turkey). |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland / Garrigue |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. It thrives in open, exposed locations, receiving at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Drought-tolerant once established. Water regularly during its first year to establish, then infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during summer months. Avoid overwatering. |

## Introduction
Cistus (from the Greek kistos) is a genus of flowering plants in the rockrose family Cistaceae, containing about 20 species (Ellul et al. 2002). They are perennial shrubs found on dry or rocky soils throughout the Mediterranean region, from Morocco, Spain, Italy, Greece, through to the Middle East, and also on the Canary Islands.
Cistus, with its many hybrids and cultivars, is commonly encountered as a garden flower.
The common name rockrose (rock rose in the UK) is applied to the species, a name also shared by the related genera Helianthemum and Tuberaria, all in the family Cistaceae. The common name gum cistus is applied to resin-bearing species, especially C. ladanifer. Sometimes known as 'Pheasant's Compromise'

## Care Guide
Cretan Rockrose flourishes in full sun and well-drained, lean soils typical of its Mediterranean habitat. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low. Cistus creticus L. is adapted to poor, rocky soils and generally does not require much fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, if needed, is sufficient, but often unnecessary.
