## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Andean regions of South America (e.g., Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia) and parts of the Caribbean. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forests and Semi-Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial sun. Thrives in bright, direct light for at least 6 hours daily, typical of open, disturbed areas or forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Water regularly during the active growing season, allowing the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out completely between waterings. Tolerant of moderate drought, but consistent moisture without waterlogging promotes better growth. |

## Care Guide
This passionflower thrives in bright, direct light and well-draining soil, mimicking its native tropical dry forest and scrubland habitats. Water consistently during growth, allowing some drying between sessions, and feed lightly to support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeder. Apply a balanced, diluted fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season. Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler, dormant, or drier periods.
