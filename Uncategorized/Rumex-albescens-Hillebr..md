## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands, USA (specifically Oahu, Maui, Molokai) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Wet Forest / Bogs |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to bright indirect light. Can tolerate some morning sun but prefers protection from intense midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Soil should be kept consistently moist, reflecting its native wet and mesic forest habitats. Requires frequent watering, ensuring good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
The docks and sorrels, genus Rumex, are a genus of about 200 species of annual, biennial, and perennial herbs in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae.
Members of this genus are very common perennial herbs with a native almost worldwide distribution, and introduced species growing in the few places where the genus is not native.
Some are nuisance weeds (and are sometimes called dockweed or dock weed), but some are grown for their edible leaves. Rumex species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species, and are the only host plants of Lycaena dispar and Lycaena rubidus.

## Care Guide
Oahu Dock thrives in consistently moist conditions, mimicking its native Hawaiian montane wet forests and bogs. Provide partial sun to bright indirect light and fertilize moderately during its active growing period to support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring/summer). Less frequent fertilization may be appropriate for plants in bog-like conditions.
