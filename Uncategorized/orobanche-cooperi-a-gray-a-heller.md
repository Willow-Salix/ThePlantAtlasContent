## 🧤 Care Instructions
Desert Broomrape is a holoparasitic plant, completely reliant on a host plant for all water and nutrients. Its 'care' is inherently tied to cultivating a suitable host plant (typically desert shrubs or annuals) in conditions mimicking its native arid environment: full sun exposure and infrequent, deep watering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Obtains all nutrients directly from its host plant; therefore, the focus should be on ensuring the host plant receives appropriate fertilization for its needs.
