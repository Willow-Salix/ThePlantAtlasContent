## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant shrub thrives in full sun to partial shade, adapting well to Mediterranean climates. Once established, it requires minimal watering, primarily during prolonged dry spells, and does not need regular fertilization, preferring lean, well-drained soils.

### Fertilizer
