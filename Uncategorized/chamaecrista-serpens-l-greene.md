## 🧤 Care Instructions
This slender sensitive pea thrives in warm, humid conditions with full sun exposure and consistently moist, well-drained soil. As a legume, it requires minimal fertilization, preferring a light feeding or good organic matter. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen fertilization is unnecessary. A light, balanced fertilizer or compost once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
