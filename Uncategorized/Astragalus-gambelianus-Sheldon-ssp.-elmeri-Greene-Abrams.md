## Care Guide
This annual thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, reflecting its native Mediterranean chaparral habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering, especially during its summer dormancy. Minimal fertilization is required due to its ability to fix nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean to moderately poor soils. As a legume, it can fix nitrogen. A very light, balanced fertilizer application once in early spring is sufficient, or none if planted in rich soil.
