## Care Guide
Abrams' Oxytheca is adapted to the hot, dry summers and cooler, wetter winters of its native Mediterranean scrubland. It requires full sun and exceptionally well-draining soil to mimic its natural sandy washes and dry slopes. Once established, it is very drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering and minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to poor soils; minimal or no fertilization is typically needed.
