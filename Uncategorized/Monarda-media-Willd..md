## Introduction
Monarda is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. The genus is endemic to North America. Common names include bergamot, bee balm, horsemint, and oswego tea, the first being inspired by the fragrance of the leaves, which is reminiscent of bergamot orange (Citrus bergamia). The genus was named for the Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes, who wrote a book in 1574 describing plants of the New World.

## Care Guide
Purple Bergamot thrives in full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native habitat in eastern North American woodlands. Provide regular watering, especially during dry spells, and minimal fertilization in average to rich soils. This approach ensures healthy growth and vibrant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in average to rich, well-draining soil. Minimal fertilization is typically needed; an annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial in poor soils.
