## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar boreal and arctic regions, including Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, UK), North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska), and Asia (e.g., Siberia). |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest/Taiga, Arctic Tundra, Alpine (cold, moist, often rocky habitats). |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light. Thrives in shaded or partially shaded conditions, mimicking its natural habitat on north-facing rocks or under forest cover. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and consistent moisture are crucial. Keep the substrate or environment constantly damp but not waterlogged, mimicking its natural preference for moist rock crevices and damp soil. Regular misting can be beneficial. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
To cultivate Myurella gracilis, provide a cool environment with low to medium indirect light and consistently high humidity. Ensure the growing medium or substrate remains constantly moist but never waterlogged. Fertilization is rarely needed, as this moss thrives on minimal nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses are not heavy feeders and can be harmed by excessive fertilization. A very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly once or twice a year might be tolerated, but is often unnecessary.
