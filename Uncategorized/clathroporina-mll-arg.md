## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen thrives in high humidity and indirect light, characteristic of its tropical rainforest origin. It requires consistent moisture through ambient humidity or misting and absorbs all necessary nutrients from its environment, rendering traditional fertilization unnecessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; lichens absorb nutrients directly from the air, rain, and the surface of their substrate, not from traditional soil fertilizers.
