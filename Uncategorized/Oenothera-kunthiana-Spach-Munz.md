## Introduction
Oenothera is a genus of about 145 species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas. It is the type genus of the family Onagraceae.  Common names include evening primrose, suncups, and sundrops. They are not closely related to the true primroses (genus Primula).

## Care Guide
This resilient evening primrose thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native grasslands. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and provide minimal fertilization to avoid leggy growth, as it's adapted to leaner conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to light fertilization; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in early spring, or none if planted in fertile soil.
