## 🧤 Care Instructions
This high desert native requires full sun exposure and is exceptionally drought-tolerant, needing infrequent deep watering. It thrives in lean, well-draining soil and has very low fertilizer requirements, making it an ideal choice for arid or xeriscape gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. Native to nutrient-poor desert soils, it does not benefit from rich fertilization. If growth is exceptionally poor, a very light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer might be applied once in spring.
