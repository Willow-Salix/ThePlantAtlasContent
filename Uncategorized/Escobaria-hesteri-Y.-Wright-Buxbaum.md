## Care Guide
Hester's Foxtail Cactus thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid desert environment. Provide abundant direct sunlight and allow the soil to completely dry out between sparse waterings. Minimal fertilization is needed during its active growth period to ensure robust health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. Fertilize once or twice during the growing season (spring/summer) with a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer.
