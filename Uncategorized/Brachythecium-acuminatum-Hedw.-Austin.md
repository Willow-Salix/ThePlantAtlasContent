## Care Guide
This moss thrives in consistently moist, humid environments with dappled or indirect light, mirroring its native temperate forest floor habitat. Ensure good drainage to prevent rot while maintaining substrate dampness. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its low nutrient requirements.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; mosses generally require very little external fertilization, relying on decaying organic matter in their substrate.
