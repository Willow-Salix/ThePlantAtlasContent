## Care Guide
Gray Goldenrod is a hardy plant native to dry, open areas of North America, hence it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering and fertilizer, making it a low-maintenance option for sunny gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low; it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Fertilization is generally not required, or a very light, balanced application once a year in spring if soils are extremely poor.
