## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Texas, New Mexico) and Northern Mexico (e.g., Chihuahua, Coahuila) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Chihuahuan Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open desert habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering can be detrimental. |

## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established. It tolerates dry conditions well and has very low fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance option for arid landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils, it generally does not require much fertilizer. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all, is sufficient.
