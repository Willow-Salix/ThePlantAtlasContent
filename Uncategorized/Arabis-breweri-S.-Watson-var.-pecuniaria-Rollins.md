## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (specifically mountainous regions such as the North Coast Ranges, Sierra Nevada, and Transverse Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Montane / Subalpine (characterized by dry, hot summers, wet winters, and often rocky, well-drained or serpentine soils) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, exposed environments typical of rocky slopes and high-elevation clearings. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Drought-tolerant once established. Requires excellent drainage; avoid waterlogging. Water infrequently but deeply during active growth, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce water significantly during dry seasons. |

## Care Guide
Brewer's Rockcress thrives in conditions mimicking its native Californian montane habitat, preferring full sun, exceptionally well-drained and nutrient-poor soil. It is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, with care taken to avoid any waterlogging, especially during warm, dry periods.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, or serpentine soils. Fertilization is generally not required; if growth seems stunted, a very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
