## Care Guide
Hairy Rockcress thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil, tolerating dry conditions once established. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and fertilize minimally to mimic its native rocky, nutrient-poor habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low, as it naturally grows in lean, rocky soils; minimal or no fertilization is typically needed.
