## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate to Boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., Europe, North America, parts of Asia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate Boreal Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect light to partial shade, sheltered from direct sun. As an epiphytic lichen, it naturally grows under tree canopies. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and frequent moisture from rain, dew, or mist. It absorbs water directly from the air and precipitation; does not require traditional root watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hypogymnia is a genus of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. They are commonly known as tube lichens, bone lichens, or pillow lichens. Most species lack rhizines (root-like attachment organs on the lower surface) that are otherwise common in members of the Parmeliaceae, and have swollen lobes that are usually hollow. Other common characteristics are relatively small spores and the presence of physodic acid and related lichen products. The lichens usually grow on the bark and wood of coniferous trees.
Hypogymnia was proposed by lichenologist William Nylander, first as a subgenus of Parmelia in 1881, and 15 years later as a distinct genus of two species, including the widespread and common type species, Hypogymnia physodes. It has since grown to about 90 recognized species. Hypogymnia has a centre of biodiversity in China, where many of its species are found.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, humid conditions with indirect light and good air circulation. It needs regular moisture from misting or atmospheric humidity, but no soil or traditional fertilization. Protect from air pollution and direct sun.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Lichens derive nutrients from the air and rain, and are sensitive to air pollution.
