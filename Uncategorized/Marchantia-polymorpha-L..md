## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Cosmopolitan; found globally in temperate and cool regions across North America, Europe, Asia, and parts of the Southern Hemisphere, preferring damp, shaded microclimates. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Moist |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light to deep shade; avoid any direct sunlight, which can quickly scorch and kill the plant. |
| **Watering** | Constant moisture is essential; the substrate must never be allowed to dry out. High ambient humidity is also crucial for its survival. |

## Introduction
Marchantia is a genus of liverworts in the family Marchantiaceae and the order Marchantiales. The genus was named by French botanist Jean Marchant after his father. The widespread species Marchantia polymorpha has had its genome sequenced and is an incipient model organism.
The thallus of Marchantia  shows differentiation into two layers: an upper photosynthetic layer with a well-defined upper epidermis with pores and a lower storage layer. The thallus features tiny cup-like structures called gemma cups, containing gemmae, small packets of tissue that are used for asexual reproduction. The combination of barrel-shaped pores and the circular shape of the gemma cups are diagnostic of the genus.
Multicellular purple colored scales with single cell thickness and unicellular rhizoids are present on the ventral surface of the thallus.

## Care Guide
The Common Liverwort requires consistently high humidity and a constantly moist substrate, never allowing it to dry out. It thrives in very low light to deep shade, making it unsuitable for direct sun. Fertilization is generally not needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to none; Marchantia polymorpha thrives in nutrient-poor conditions, and excess fertilizer can be detrimental.
