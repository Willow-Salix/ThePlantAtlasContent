## Care Guide
Leskea moss thrives in cool, moist, and shady conditions typical of temperate forest floors or tree bark. Provide consistent moisture, high humidity, and low to partial indirect light. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental if overdone.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Leskea mosses are not heavy feeders and can be harmed by excessive nutrients. If desired, a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly, but it's often unnecessary.
