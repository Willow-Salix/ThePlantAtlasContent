## 🧤 Care Instructions
The California orange lichen thrives in high light, mimicking its coastal full-sun habitat. Provide high ambient humidity or regular misting, allowing for dry periods, as it absorbs moisture from the air rather than soil. Traditional fertilizers are unnecessary and potentially harmful for this lichen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens do not require traditional fertilizers and can be harmed by them, as they absorb trace elements from the atmosphere and rainwater.
