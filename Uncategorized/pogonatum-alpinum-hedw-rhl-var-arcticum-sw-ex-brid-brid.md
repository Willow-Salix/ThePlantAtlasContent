## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, including northern parts of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada), Greenland, Scandinavia, and Siberia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic Tundra or Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. While exposed in its native habitat, it benefits from protection from intense, direct sun to prevent drying out. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist conditions, mimicking meltwater or boggy areas of its native tundra. High humidity is crucial, and the substrate should never be allowed to dry out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pogonatum is a genus of mosses — commonly called spike moss — which contains approximately 70 species that cover a cosmopolitan distribution. It can be seen mostly in Asian countries with a tropical climate.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Arctic Haircap Moss, replicate its native tundra environment by providing cool temperatures, consistently moist conditions, and high humidity. Offer bright indirect light to partial shade, ensuring the substrate remains damp at all times. Avoid over-fertilization as it thrives in low-nutrient settings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses generally thrive in nutrient-poor environments, so fertilization is rarely needed and can even be detrimental.
