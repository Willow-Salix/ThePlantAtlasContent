## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South Africa (Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Grassland/Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating intense light in its native open habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow soil to dry out between waterings, reflecting its adaptation to periods of rainfall followed by drier spells. |

## Introduction
The genus Helichrysum  consists of an estimated 600 species of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). The type species is Helichrysum orientale. They often go by the names everlasting, immortelle, and strawflower. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words ἥλιος (helios, sun) and χρῡσός (chrysos, gold).
It occurs in Africa (with 244 species in South Africa), Madagascar, Australasia and Eurasia. The plants may be annuals, herbaceous perennials or shrubs, growing to a height of 60–90 cm (24–35 inches). The genus was a wastebasket taxon, and many of its members have been reclassified in smaller genera, most notably the Everlastings, now in the genus Xerochrysum.
Their leaves are oblong to lanceolate. They are flat and pubescent on both sides. The bristles of the pappus are scabrous, barbellate, or plumose.
The receptacle (base of the flower head) is often smooth, with a fringed margin, or honey-combed, and resemble daisies. They may be in almost all colors, except blue. There are many capitula and generally flat-topped corymbs or panicles. The corolla lobes show glandular hairs at the abaxial surface.
Helichrysum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the bucculaticid leaf-miners Bucculatrix gnaphaliella (which feeds exclusively on Helichrysum arenarium) and Bucculatrix helichrysella (feeds exclusively on H. italicum) and the Coleophora case-bearers C. caelebipennella, C. gnaphalii (feeds exclusively on H arenarium) and C. helichrysiella (feeds exclusively on H. italicum).

## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun to partial shade, the Licorice Plant requires moderate watering, allowing its well-drained soil to dry between sessions. It benefits from light to moderate fertilization during its active growth, supporting its vigorous foliage in conditions mimicking its subtropical grassland origins.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season; its native soils are not overly rich but provide sufficient nutrients.
