## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils, Necklacepod is a resilient tropical and subtropical coastal plant. It prefers regular moisture when young but becomes highly drought-tolerant once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it has low to moderate fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally does not require heavy nitrogen feeding. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly, especially in very poor, sandy soils.
