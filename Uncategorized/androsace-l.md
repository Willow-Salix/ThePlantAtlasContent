## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including the Alps, Himalayas, Rocky Mountains, and Central Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine zones |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure (full sun to partial shade), as they typically grow above the tree line or in open, rocky areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, ensuring excellent drainage. Allow the topsoil to dry out slightly between waterings, mimicking melting snow and rain in rocky terrain. |

## 🌱 Overview
Androsace, commonly known as rock jasmine, is a genus of flowering plants in the  family Primulaceae, second only to Primula in the number of species. It is predominantly Arctic–alpine, with many species in the Himalayas (where the genus originated), the mountains of central Asia, the Caucasus, and the southern and central European mountain systems, particularly the Alps and the Pyrenees.
Plants of this genus are sometimes known as rock jasmines or fairy candelabras, and are widely cultivated for their dense cushions covered in white or pink flowers. There are roughly 110 species.
These plants have small entire or toothed leaves which form a basal rosette.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rockjasmine thrives in cool, well-drained conditions typical of its alpine origins. It requires high sun exposure and moderate, consistent watering, always ensuring proper drainage. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum to prevent overgrowth and maintain its compact habit.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilizer. Alpine soils are generally lean, so over-fertilization can harm these plants.
