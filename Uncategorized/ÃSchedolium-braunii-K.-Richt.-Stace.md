# Braun's Ryegrass-Fescue Hybrid

*Ã—Schedolium braunii (K. Richt.) Stace* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate Eurasia, particularly Europe where its parent species of Lolium and Schedonorus are widespread. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its origin in open, exposed grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during the active growing season. Tolerates brief dry spells once established, mirroring seasonal rainfall patterns. |

## Care Guide
This temperate hybrid grass thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, tolerating some drought once established. Fertilize moderately during its active growth period to support vigorous foliage. Mimic a temperate grassland environment for optimal health and growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and summer to support vigorous growth, as temperate grassland soils can be moderately fertile and nutrient demands are high for active foliage.
