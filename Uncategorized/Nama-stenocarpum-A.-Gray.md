## Care Guide
The Mud Fiddleleaf requires consistently moist to wet soil, even though it originates from arid scrublands where it grows in riparian zones. Provide full sun exposure to mimic its natural open habitat, and fertilize sparingly with a balanced, diluted product if needed.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the growing season if soil is poor, but generally not a heavy feeder.
