## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, primarily California and southwestern Oregon |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (characterized by wet winters and dry summers), often found in open woodlands, chaparral, and grasslands. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun in cooler coastal areas or with adequate moisture, benefiting from afternoon shade in hotter, interior regions. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate and consistent during its active growth period (late winter to late spring), allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Requires well-drained soil and will go dormant (or die back as an annual) during summer dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Collinsia is a genus of about 20 species of annual flowering plants, consisting of the blue eyed Marys and the Chinese houses.  It was traditionally placed in the snapdragon family Scrophulariaceae, but following recent research in molecular genetics, it has now been placed in a much enlarged family Plantaginaceae.
The genus is endemic to North America, and is named in honor of Zacchaeus Collins, a Philadelphia botanist of the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century. Many of the 20 species may be found in California.
Two species, Collinsia parviflora (smallflower blue eyed Mary) and Collinsia violacea (violet blue eyed Mary), had medicinal uses among American Indian peoples.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spinster's Blue-Eyed Mary is an annual native to Mediterranean climates, thriving with full sun to partial shade and moderate watering during its winter-spring growth. It requires well-drained soil and minimal fertilization, completing its lifecycle before summer heat and drought.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not essential if planted in reasonably fertile soil. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be given in early spring if soil nutrients are poor.
