## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, tolerating dry periods typical of its native subtropical dry forest and coastal scrub habitats. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings and provide only infrequent, low-to-moderate fertilization. It is a resilient species well-suited to conditions where consistent moisture and rich soil are not present.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Requires infrequent fertilization, especially in naturally less fertile, well-drained soils; a balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
