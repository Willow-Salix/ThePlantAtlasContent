| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hispaniola (Dominican Republic, Haiti) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest / Moist Tropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sun, which can scorch leaves, as it naturally grows in the dappled light of the forest understory or as an epiphyte. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, allowing the top inch or two to dry slightly between waterings. Emulate the frequent rainfall and high humidity of its native environment. |

## Care Guide
This Anthurium thrives in conditions that mimic its native tropical rainforest. Provide bright, indirect light, consistent moisture, and high humidity, ensuring good drainage. Fertilize lightly during the growing season to support its lush foliage.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength, to support vigorous growth in its typically nutrient-rich, organic-matter environment.
