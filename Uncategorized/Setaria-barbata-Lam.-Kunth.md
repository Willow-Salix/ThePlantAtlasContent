## Introduction
Setaria is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family. The name is derived from the Latin word seta, meaning "bristle" or "hair", which refers to the bristly spikelets.
The genus includes over 100 species distributed in many tropical and temperate regions around the world, and members are commonly known as foxtail or bristle grasses.

## Care Guide
East Indian Bristlegrass thrives in warm, humid conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade. Maintain consistently moist soil and provide moderate fertilization during its active growth to ensure vigorous development, while avoiding excessive dryness or waterlogged roots.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer applied every 4-6 weeks during its primary growing season, as it thrives in average to rich tropical soils but is not overly demanding.
