## 🧤 Care Instructions
Antisell's Milkvetch is a drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native Mediterranean shrubland environment. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen, requiring minimal fertilization. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, particularly during summer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. These plants are often adapted to nutrient-poor soils and, as legumes, fix their own nitrogen. A light application of a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer once a year in spring, or none at all, is usually sufficient.
