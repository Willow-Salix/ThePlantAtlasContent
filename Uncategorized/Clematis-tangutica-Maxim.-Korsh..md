## Introduction
Clematis is a genus of about 380 species within the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae. Their garden hybrids and cultivars have been popular among gardeners, beginning with Clematis 'Jackmanii', a garden staple since 1862. More cultivars are being produced constantly,  mainly of Chinese and Japanese origin.

## Care Guide
Golden Tiara Clematis thrives in full sun with well-drained soil, mimicking its native temperate montane and steppe habitats. It requires moderate watering, particularly during its growing season, and benefits from a balanced fertilizer application in spring. Ensuring excellent drainage is paramount for its overall health and vitality.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost can be applied in spring and early summer, considering the typically varied but not overly rich soils of its native range.
