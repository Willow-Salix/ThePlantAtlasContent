## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted shrub thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, mimicking its native arid environment. Ensure extremely well-draining soil and avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization needs are minimal, aligning with its natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; native desert soils are often lean. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring may be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary.
