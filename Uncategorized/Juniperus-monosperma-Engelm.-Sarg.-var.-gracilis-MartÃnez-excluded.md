| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. |

## Introduction
Junipers are coniferous trees and shrubs in the genus Juniperus ( joo-NIP-ər-əs) of the cypress family Cupressaceae. Depending on the taxonomy, between 50 and 67 species of junipers are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere as far south as tropical Africa, as far north as the Arctic, and parts of Asia and Central America. The highest-known juniper forest occurs at an altitude of 4,900 metres (16,100 ft) in southeastern Tibet and the northern Himalayas, creating one of the highest tree lines on earth.

## Care Guide
Oneseed Juniper thrives in harsh, dry conditions, necessitating full sun exposure and extremely well-draining soil. Water sparingly and infrequently once established to mimic its arid native climate. Fertilization is rarely needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor, rocky soils and generally does not require supplemental feeding. If desired, a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly in early spring.
