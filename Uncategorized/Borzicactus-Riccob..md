## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full, intense sun, replicating its high-altitude desert environment. Water sparingly, ensuring the soil is completely dry between waterings, and nearly stop watering in winter. Use a well-draining cactus mix and provide minimal fertilization during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low. Apply a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus or succulent fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer). Do not fertilize in winter.
