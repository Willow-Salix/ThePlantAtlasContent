## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically mountainous regions of California and Nevada (e.g., Sierra Nevada) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean/Montane. Characterized by dry, hot summers and cool, wet winters, often with well-drained, rocky soils and high sun exposure. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in full sun due to its open, high-elevation native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry summers. Requires infrequent to no watering during dry periods; water moderately during spring growth if natural rainfall is insufficient. |

## Introduction
Monardella villosa is a plant in the mint family which is known by the common name coyote mint. In 2020, it was included in Monardella odoratissima. As of April 2024, acceptance of the inclusion varies.
When separated from Monardella odoratissima, it is a perennial wildflower found only in California, except for one subspecies which sometimes occurs in Oregon. It grows in habitats of the California chaparral and woodlands in the California Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada foothills.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant perennial thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean/montane habitat. Once established, it requires minimal watering and generally does not need significant fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry gardens.

### Fertilizer
Prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Generally does not require heavy fertilization; a light, balanced feed in spring is optional.
