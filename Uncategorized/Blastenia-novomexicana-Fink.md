## 🌱 Overview
Blastenia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Teloschistaceae. The genus was established in 1852 by the Italian botanist Abramo Massalongo, who brought together several species that had previously been scattered across different genera. These lichens are characterised by their rust-brown to orange-red fruiting bodies and a thin, crusty growth that often breaks into small plate-like sections. The genus includes around 40 recognised species found primarily in the Mediterranean region and Macaronesia, though some species have spread to other parts of the world.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen is highly adapted to harsh, dry, and brightly lit conditions, typically growing on exposed rocks in arid regions. It requires no traditional watering or fertilization, deriving all its needs from the atmosphere and substrate. Overwatering or high humidity will be detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens are self-sufficient, obtaining all necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate (e.g., rock).
