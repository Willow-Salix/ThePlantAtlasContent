# Georgia Sunrose
### *Crocanthemum georgianum (Chapm.) Barnhart*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Dry Shrubland / Pineland (specifically xeric sandhills) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry out between applications, as it is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to well-draining, sandy soils. |

## 🌱 Overview
Crocanthemum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cistaceae. They are native to both North and South America where they are widespread. The common name frostweed relates to the ice crystals which form from sap exuding from cracks near the base of the stem in the late fall.
Crocanthemum are herbaceous perennials or subshrubs with alternate leaves. With the exception of species in California, they generally produce two types of flowers: showy, yellow chasmogamous (cross-pollinated) produced earlier in the growing season, followed by cleistogamous (self-pollinated) flowers that are smaller and lack petals. All species of Crocanthemum are fire tolerant and are found in open habitats.
Although the genus was first named in 1836 to encompass New World species of Helianthemum, it generally went unrecognized by taxonomists and its species were included in a broad concept of Helianthemum throughout much of the 1800s and 1900s. However, phylogenetic studies in 2004 and 2009 indicated that the New World species of Helianthemum were more closely related to Hudsonia than Old World Helianthemum. This required the resurrection of the genus Crocanthemum in order to maintain monophyly.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Georgia Sunrose thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils, mimicking its native sandhill environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils typical of its native sandhill environments.
