## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and boreal regions, including Fennoscandia, Greenland, Alaska, Canada, and Russia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure; adapted to direct sun in cold, exposed environments, but can tolerate periods of lower light. |
| **Watering** | Requires intermittent moisture, thriving on cycles of thorough wetting followed by complete drying, mimicking natural precipitation patterns like rain and snowmelt. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cold, bright, and airy conditions typical of arctic and alpine environments. Provide high light exposure and ensure periods of thorough wetting followed by complete drying to mimic natural precipitation patterns. Avoid all forms of traditional fertilization, as it draws nutrients from the air and substrate naturally.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; traditional fertilizers are detrimental. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and substrate.
