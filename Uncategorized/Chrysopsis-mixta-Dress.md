## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolinas) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Pine Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun (thrives in open, sunny clearings or under sparse pine canopies) |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to well-drained sandy soils. |

## Introduction
Chrysopsis (golden asters) are plants in the family Asteraceae native to the southern and eastern United States. All the species are found in Florida, although some are found in other states as well.
These are annual and perennial herbs bearing daisy-like flower heads with yellow disc florets and usually yellow ray florets. Some species formerly classified in this genus are now included in other genera: Heterotheca, Pityopsis, Stenotus, Ionactis, Aster, Eucephalus, Erigeron, Machaeranthera, Croptilon, Xanthisma, Oclemena, Bradburia, Oxypappus, Arnica, and Helichrysopsis.
Golden asters are often used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Schinia petulans (which feeds exclusively on C. subulata).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native subtropical pine woodlands, requiring abundant sunlight and well-drained, sandy soil. It is drought-tolerant once established, needing moderate watering and only light fertilization to prevent over-enrichment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Native sandy soils are often nutrient-poor, so over-fertilization can be detrimental. A light application of balanced fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient.
