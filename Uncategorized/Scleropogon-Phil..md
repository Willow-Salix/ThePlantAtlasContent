## Care Guide
Burrograss is a robust, drought-tolerant perennial adapted to harsh, arid conditions. It thrives in full sun with very little water and no need for fertilizer, making it ideal for xeriscaping or low-maintenance landscapes in dry climates.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, often sandy or rocky desert soils and can be harmed by excessive nutrients.
