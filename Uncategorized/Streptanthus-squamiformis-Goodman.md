## Care Guide
The Pineoak Jewelflower is best grown in full sun with well-draining, lean soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean woodland habitat. Provide moderate water during its active growing season in late winter to spring, allowing for dry periods, and avoid over-fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Prefers lean, nutrient-poor soils like its native serpentinite. Minimal to no fertilization is required; rich soils can be detrimental.
