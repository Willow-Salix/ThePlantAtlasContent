## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (USA: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-arid Montane Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires direct sun exposure for most of the day, reflecting its native habitat on open slopes and plains. |
| **💧 Water** | Low watering. Prefers dry to moderately dry conditions; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry out between waterings to mimic its semi-arid native rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sophora is a genus of about 45 species of small trees and shrubs in the pea family Fabaceae. The species have a pantropical distribution. The generic name is derived from sophera, an Arabic name for a pea-flowered tree.
The genus formerly had a broader interpretation including many other species now treated in other genera, notably Styphnolobium (pagoda tree genus), which differs in lacking nitrogen fixing bacteria (rhizobia) on the roots, and Dermatophyllum (the mescalbeans). Styphnolobium has galactomannans as seed polysaccharide reserve, in contrast Sophora contains arabinogalactans, and Dermatophyllum amylose.
The New Zealand Sophora species are known as kowhai.
The seeds of species such as Sophora affinis and Sophora chrysophylla are reported to be poisonous.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its semi-arid montane origins. Watering should be infrequent and deep, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. Avoid heavy fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and fixes its own nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils, often calcareous, and does not require rich nutrient input.
