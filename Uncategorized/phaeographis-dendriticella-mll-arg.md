## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical lichen thrives in very high humidity and indirect, filtered light, mimicking its arboreal rainforest environment. It needs frequent moisture from the air or misting, coupled with excellent air circulation to prevent fungal issues. Fertilization is generally not necessary and can be detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not typically required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust) and the substrate. Traditional fertilizers can be harmful.
