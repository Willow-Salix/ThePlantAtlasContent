## Introduction
Rorippa is a globally distributed genus in the family Brassicaceae, with species occurring on all continents except for Antarctica. Rorippa species are natively distributed in the Northern Hemisphere through Eurasia and North America, and dispersed into the Southern Hemisphere through long-distance dispersal. Rorippa species are annual to perennial herbs, usually with yellow flowers and a peppery flavour. They are known commonly as yellowcresses.

## Care Guide
Spreading Yellowcress thrives in full to partial sun with consistently wet or saturated soil conditions, mimicking its native riparian and wetland habitats. It has low to moderate nutrient demands, often growing robustly in naturally fertile, disturbed moist areas without extensive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in moderately fertile soils typically found in its native moist habitats. May benefit from a balanced fertilizer in poor soils.
