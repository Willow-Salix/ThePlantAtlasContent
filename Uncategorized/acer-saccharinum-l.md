## 🌱 Overview
Acer saccharinum, commonly known as silver maple, creek maple, silverleaf maple, soft maple, large maple, water maple, swamp maple, or white maple, is a species of maple native to the eastern and central United States and southeastern Canada. It is one of the most common trees in the United States.
Although the silver maple's Latin name is similar, it should not be confused with Acer saccharum, the sugar maple. Some of the common names are also applied to other maples, especially Acer rubrum.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Silver Maple thrives in full sun with consistently moist soil, tolerating even wet conditions due to its natural preference for riparian areas. It is adaptable to various soil types but benefits from moderate fertility. Ensure adequate space for its large mature size and strong root system.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to low. Thrives in rich, moist soils naturally found in its native habitat. Fertilize sparingly or as needed, especially in nutrient-poor soils or to encourage faster growth.
