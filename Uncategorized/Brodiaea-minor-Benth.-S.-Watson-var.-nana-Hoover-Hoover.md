| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright, direct light during its active growing season (late winter to spring). |
| **Watering** | Water regularly during the active growth period (late winter to spring), allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Keep dry during summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Brodiaea , also known by the common name cluster-lilies, is a monocot genus of flowering plants.
One school of thought places the genus in the family Themidaceae, while another school of thought places it in the subfamily Brodiaeoideae of the family Asparagaceae.  The USDA Plants Database still classifies the genus Brodiaea in the family Liliaceae.
Brodiaea species occur along the Pacific Coast region of North America, from British Columbia throughout California into the Baja California Peninsula. They are especially common in northern California.

## Care Guide
This dwarf bulbous plant thrives by mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. Provide full sun during its active growth in late winter and spring with regular watering. Allow the plant to go completely dry and dormant through the hot summer months.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization. A light, balanced liquid fertilizer applied once or twice during active growth is sufficient; often, none is needed in good soil.
