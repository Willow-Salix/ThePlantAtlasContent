## Care Guide
Peirson's Suncup thrives in full sun and requires extremely well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mojave Desert habitat. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor, well-draining soils. Minimal to no fertilization needed.
