## Care Guide
This annual plant requires full sun and consistent, abundant water mimicking its native vernal pool environment during its active growth period. As it completes its life cycle, allow the soil to dry out completely. Fertilization is generally not needed and should be minimal if applied.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; these plants are adapted to nutrient-poor soils characteristic of vernal pools and may be sensitive to high fertility.
