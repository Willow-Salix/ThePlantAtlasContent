## 🧤 Care Instructions
Beach Naupaka is a hardy coastal plant thriving in full sun and well-draining soil, accustomed to salt spray and sandy conditions. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between waterings, and fertilize lightly, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor beach environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adaptable to nutrient-poor sandy soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer annually is generally sufficient, if at all necessary.
