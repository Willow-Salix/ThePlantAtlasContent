## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eurasia (Europe and Asia), based on the general distribution of the Taraxacum genus given the 'nom. inq.' status of this specific name. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. As common inhabitants of open grasslands and disturbed areas in temperate climates, they are adapted to high light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Prefers consistently moist soil during active growth, but established plants exhibit good drought tolerance, reflecting the variable rainfall patterns common in temperate grasslands. |

## Introduction
Taraxacum () is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, which consists of species commonly known as dandelions. The scientific and hobby study of the genus is known as taraxacology. The genus has a near-cosmopolitan distribution, absent only from tropical and polar areas. Two of the most common species worldwide, T. officinale (the common dandelion) and T. erythrospermum (the red-seeded dandelion), are European species introduced into North America, where they are non-native. Dandelions thrive in temperate regions and can be found in yards, gardens, sides of roads, among crops, and in many other habitats.
Like other members of the family Asteraceae, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is called a floret. In part due to their abundance, along with being a generalist species, dandelions are one of the most vital early spring nectar sources for a wide host of pollinators. Many Taraxacum species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.

## Care Guide
Dandelions are remarkably resilient plants, thriving in full sun to partial shade with moderate watering. They require minimal fertilizer, preferring average soils, and demonstrate robust adaptability across temperate climates.

### Fertilizer
Low. Dandelions are known for their ability to thrive in a wide range of soil types, from poor to moderately fertile, which is characteristic of many resilient grassland species.
