Laothoe, consort of King Porthaon of Calydon and mother of Sterope, Stratonice and Eurythemiste.

When Heracles hunted and ultimately slayed the Cithaeronian lion, Laothoe with her other sisters, except for one, all laid with the hero in a night, a week or for 50 days as what their father strongly desired it to be. Laothoe bore Heracles a son, Antiphus.
Laothoe, mother of Thestor by Idmon.
Laothoe, a consort of Priam, king of Troy, and mother of Lycaon and sometimes Polydorus. Her father was Altes, king of the Leleges.
