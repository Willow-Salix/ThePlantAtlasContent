## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spanish Clover thrives in full sun exposures and is well-adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers. It requires moderate watering during its active growing season but is highly drought-tolerant once established. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally needs minimal to no additional nitrogen fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed, especially nitrogen, due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume. A low-phosphorus or balanced slow-release fertilizer could be used if soil is very poor.
