## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate and Boreal Forests (often in exposed, disturbed areas or on nutrient-rich substrates within these biomes) |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun (thrives in bright, exposed conditions, often on tree bark, rock, or concrete) |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity or frequent misting; as a lichen, it absorbs water directly from the air and rain, requiring periods of hydration followed by complete drying. |

## Introduction
Caloplaca is a lichen genus comprising a number of distinct species. Members of the genus are commonly called firedot lichen, jewel lichen. gold lichens, "orange lichens", but they are not always orange, as in the case of C. albovariegata. The distribution of this lichen genus is worldwide, extending from Antarctica to the high Arctic. It includes a portion of northern North America and the Russian High Arctic. There are about thirty species of Caloplaca in the flora of the British Isles.
A new species of Caloplaca, C. obamae, the first species to be named in honor of Barack Obama, was discovered in 2007 on Santa Rosa Island in California and published in March 2009.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions with good air circulation and high ambient humidity or regular moisture. It requires no traditional fertilization, as it is sensitive to external nutrients, and tolerates periods of drying between hydration.

### Fertilizer
None; lichens are self-sufficient symbionts and are highly sensitive to external nutrients and pollutants, often thriving in nitrogen-enriched but unfertilized environments.
