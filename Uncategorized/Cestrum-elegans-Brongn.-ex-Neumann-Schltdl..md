| **Native Origin** | Mexico |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to bright indirect light; can tolerate some morning sun but protect from harsh afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is key; water when the top inch of soil feels dry, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Cestrum is a genus of — depending on authority — 150-250 species of flowering plants in the family Solanaceae. They are native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Americas, from the southernmost United States (Florida, Texas: day-blooming cestrum, C. diurnum) south to the Bío-Bío Region in central Chile (green cestrum, C. parqui). They are colloquially known as cestrums or jessamines (probably from the word "jasmine", due to their fragrant flowers).
They are shrubs growing to 1–4 m (3 ft 3 in – 13 ft 1 in) tall. Most are evergreen; a few are deciduous. All parts of the plants are toxic, causing severe gastroenteritis if eaten.

## Care Guide
Purple Cestrum thrives in conditions similar to its native moist montane forests. It prefers partial sun to bright indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Regular feeding during the growing season will promote vigorous growth and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; feed every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer.
