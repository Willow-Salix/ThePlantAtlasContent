## Care Guide
Xanthosoma thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical rainforest origin, requiring bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. High humidity is crucial, and it benefits from regular fertilization during its active growing season to support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to heavy feeder during the growing season (spring and summer). Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks due to the rich, decomposing organic matter found in native soils.
