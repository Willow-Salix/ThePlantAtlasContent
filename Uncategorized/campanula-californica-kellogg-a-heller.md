## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, thriving best when its roots never dry out. It prefers full sun to partial shade. Fertilization should be kept minimal to moderate, as it naturally adapts to less nutrient-rich environments typical of its wetland habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, balanced fertilizer, if any; avoid over-fertilization.
