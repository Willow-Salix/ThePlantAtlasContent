## Care Guide
Spiny Wattle thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring arid to Mediterranean conditions. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent deep watering. Fertilization should be minimal and low in phosphorus to mimic its native environment.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in nutrient-poor soils. If fertilizing, use a slow-release, low-phosphorus formula specifically designed for Australian native plants, and apply very sparingly.
