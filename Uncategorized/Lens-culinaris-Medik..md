| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate and Semi-Arid Temperate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with open field exposure in its native region. |

## Introduction
The lentil (Vicia lens or Lens culinaris) is an annual legume grown for its lens-shaped edible seeds or pulses, also called lentils. It is about 40 cm (16 in) tall, and the seeds grow in pods, usually with two seeds in each.
Lentil seeds are used around the world for culinary purposes, most commonly in stews or soups. In cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, where lentils are a staple, split lentils (often with their hulls removed) known as dal are often cooked into a thick curry that is usually eaten with rice or roti.

## Care Guide
Lentils thrive in full sun exposure and require well-draining soil characteristic of their Mediterranean and Near Eastern origins. They need moderate, consistent watering during critical growth stages but are intolerant of waterlogging. As legumes, they generally require minimal nitrogen fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low nitrogen fertilizer requirements due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities (legume). A balanced fertilizer, potentially with higher phosphorus and potassium, may be beneficial in poor soils.
