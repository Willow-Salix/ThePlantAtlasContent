## Care Guide
This Mediterranean liverwort thrives in consistently moist, well-drained conditions under partial shade or bright indirect light. Avoid strong direct sun and excessive fertilization. Allow for a slightly drier period if mimicking its natural seasonal dormancy, but maintain moisture for active growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. If absolutely necessary, use a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly.
