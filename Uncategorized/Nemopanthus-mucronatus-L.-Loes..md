## Care Guide
Mountain-holly thrives in consistently moist, acidic soils found in temperate forests and bogs of Eastern North America. It adapts well to full sun or partial shade and requires steady moisture, disliking dry conditions. Provide light, acid-forming fertilizer to promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Native to areas with often acidic and sometimes nutrient-poor soils (especially bogs). Benefits from light fertilization with an acid-forming fertilizer, particularly in spring, to support vigorous growth.
