## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico (specifically Jalisco for the variety); generally distributed across Central and North America. |
| **Climate** | Sub-humid Tropical Grassland / Tropical Dry Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily). Thrives in open, exposed locations, mimicking its natural habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low. Water regularly during the growing season, allowing the top soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerates drought once established, but dislikes waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Chamaecrista is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Members of the genus are commonly known as sensitive pea. Several species are capable of rapid plant movement. Unlike the related genera Cassia and Senna, members of Chamaecrista form root nodules.
Chamaecrista has 367 species, with a wide distribution – the Americas from Minnesota to northern Argentina, sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Iran, the Indian Subcontinent, Indochina, China, Korea, Japan, Malesia, New Guinea, and Australia.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its native open grassland and dry forest environments. Water moderately during its active growth, ensuring good drainage as it tolerates dry spells and is susceptible to root rot in waterlogged conditions. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it generally requires very little to no supplemental fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it can fix atmospheric nitrogen, reducing the need for external nitrogen fertilization. If soil is extremely poor, a balanced, low-dose fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
