## Care Guide
This climbing plant thrives in conditions similar to its native humid subtropical woodlands, preferring bright indirect to partial sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Ensure it has support for its vining habit and provide moderate fertilization during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength applied every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
