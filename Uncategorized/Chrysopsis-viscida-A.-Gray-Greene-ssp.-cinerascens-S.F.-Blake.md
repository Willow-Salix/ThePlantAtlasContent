## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida and Georgia) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Sandhills/Pine Flatwoods |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; highly drought-tolerant once established, preferring well-drained soil. Water deeply when the top few inches of soil are dry. |

## Introduction
Chrysopsis (golden asters) are plants in the family Asteraceae native to the southern and eastern United States. All the species are found in Florida, although some are found in other states as well.
These are annual and perennial herbs bearing daisy-like flower heads with yellow disc florets and usually yellow ray florets. Some species formerly classified in this genus are now included in other genera: Heterotheca, Pityopsis, Stenotus, Ionactis, Aster, Eucephalus, Erigeron, Machaeranthera, Croptilon, Xanthisma, Oclemena, Bradburia, Oxypappus, Arnica, and Helichrysopsis.
Golden asters are often used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Schinia petulans (which feeds exclusively on C. subulata).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, mimicking its native subtropical sandhills and pine flatwoods. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, using a slow-release, low-phosphorus formula.
