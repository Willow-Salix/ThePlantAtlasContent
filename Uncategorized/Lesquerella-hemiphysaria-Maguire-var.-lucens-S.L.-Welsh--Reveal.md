## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Intermountain West region of the United States, specifically parts of Nevada and Utah |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, as it grows in exposed, open environments. |
| **Watering** | Very low; highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially once established. |

## Introduction
Lesquerella is the former name of a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Recent work has shown that Lesquerella is indistinct from the genus Physaria and both genera have been united under Physaria. In addition, the former Lesquerella of the southeastern United States have been moved to the genus Paysonia since 2002. The genus Lesquerella is now no longer applied to any species and is considered defunct.
The genus is named in honor of Leo Lesquereux, 1805–1889, Swiss and American botanist.

## Care Guide
Adapted to the harsh conditions of its native arid scrubland, the Intermountain Bladderpod requires full sun and excellent drainage. It is extremely drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization once established, making it ideal for xeriscaping.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
