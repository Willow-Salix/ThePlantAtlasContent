## Care Guide
Purple Braya thrives in cool, bright conditions with well-drained soil, mimicking its arctic tundra home. Provide full to partial sun and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between applications to prevent rot. Fertilize very sparingly due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a diluted, balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season. Native soils are typically nutrient-poor.
