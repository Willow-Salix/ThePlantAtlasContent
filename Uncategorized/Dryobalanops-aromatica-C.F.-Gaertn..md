| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia, including parts of Borneo (Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei), Sumatra (Indonesia), and Peninsular Malaysia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers bright, direct light for optimal growth as an emergent canopy tree. |

## Introduction
Dryobalanops is a genus of flowering plants and the genus of family Dipterocarpaceae. The name Dryobalanops is derived from Greek (dryas = a nymph associated with oaks and balanops = acorn) and describes the acorn-like nut. The genus has seven species, confined to the tropical forests of western Malesia (Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo). It is among the most abundant species of emergent trees in these forests, growing up to 80 m tall.
The genus is of considerable importance as timber trees and sold under the trade name Kapur. The timber is an important heavy and durable construction timber. D. aromatica was an important source of camphor.
As the trees mature, they mutually avoid touching each other in a phenomenon known as crown shyness.

## Care Guide
Borneo Camphor thrives in environments that replicate its native tropical rainforest conditions. Provide abundant, bright light (full to partial sun) and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil. Regular fertilization during the growing season will support its vigorous development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to regular fertilization with a balanced, slow-release or liquid fertilizer during active growth periods, as rainforest soils can be nutrient-poor.
