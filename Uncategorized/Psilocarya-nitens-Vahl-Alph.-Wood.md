## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (from Virginia to Florida and west to Louisiana), parts of Central America, and Caribbean islands. |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Wetland / Temperate Wetland (e.g., bogs, wet pine flatwoods, savannas) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. It thrives best with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with open wetland environments. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, often thriving in saturated conditions or shallow standing water, mirroring its native bog and wetland habitats. |

## Introduction
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## Care Guide
Shiny Baldrush requires consistently wet to saturated soil conditions, ideally mimicking its native wetland habitat, and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments, minimal fertilization is necessary for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils common in its natural habitat; over-fertilization can be detrimental. A very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all, is generally sufficient.
