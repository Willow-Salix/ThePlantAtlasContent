## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in full sun for optimal flowering, especially in cooler regions of its native range. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently once established, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, particularly during hot, dry summers. Requires more regular watering during establishment. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
Foothill Penstemon is well-suited to full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, necessitating infrequent watering during dry periods and minimal fertilization. Proper care ensures abundant blooms and a robust plant.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically requires minimal to no fertilization. If soil is very poor, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial. Avoid over-fertilization.
