## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | British Isles, specifically western Scotland, Ireland, and Wales (hyper-oceanic regions) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Oceanic Climate (hyper-oceanic, characterized by high humidity, mild temperatures, frequent rainfall, and misty conditions within sheltered woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to deep shade; this lichen grows in the understory of dense, humid woodlands and is highly sensitive to direct sunlight, which can cause rapid desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires extremely high atmospheric humidity and frequent moisture from rain or mist; it should never be allowed to dry out for extended periods as it absorbs water directly from the environment. |

## Introduction
Halecania is a genus of fungi in the family Leprocaulaceae. It has 24 species. These lichens form inconspicuous, crust-like films that spread over rock or other surfaces, with colours ranging from chalky white through bluish-grey to brownish-grey and textures that can be cracked like dried mud, granular, or covered in tiny warts. They reproduce through small, disc-shaped fruiting bodies that contain eight colourless ascospores divided by a single cross-wall, with the spore envelope swelling conspicuously when treated with certain chemicals—a key identifying feature.

## Care Guide
Halecania viridescens is a specialized lichen thriving in the hyper-oceanic temperate woodlands of the British Isles. It requires very high humidity, frequent moisture, and indirect light, typically growing on tree bark. It is not suitable for cultivation as a typical potted plant.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers; this lichen obtains all necessary nutrients from airborne particles, dust, and rainfall, absorbed directly from its environment.
