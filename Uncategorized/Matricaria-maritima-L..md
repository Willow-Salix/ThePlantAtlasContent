## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal areas of Western and Northern Europe, including the British Isles and Scandinavia. |
| **Climate** | Coastal Temperate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, thriving in direct and unfiltered sunlight typical of open coastal environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Water regularly when young to establish; mature plants are drought-tolerant and prefer soil to dry out completely between waterings, reflecting its adaptation to well-draining coastal soils. |

## Introduction
Tripleurospermum maritimum is a species of flowering plant in the aster family commonly known as false mayweed or sea mayweed. It is found in many coastal areas of Northern Europe, including Scandinavia and Iceland, often growing in sand or amongst beach pebbles.

## Care Guide
Sea Mayweed is a hardy plant that thrives in conditions mimicking its native coastal habitat, requiring full sun and very well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant once established and benefits from infrequent watering and minimal fertilization. Avoid waterlogged conditions and overly rich soil to ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor coastal soils (sandy, shingly) and does not require rich soil or frequent fertilization. Excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
