## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate to subtropical coastal regions, including North America (e.g., California), the Mediterranean Basin, and parts of Europe and Africa. |
| **Climate** | Coastal Temperate to Mediterranean Climates, often found in woodlands or exposed rocky areas with good air quality and humidity. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. As an epiphyte, it grows on surfaces exposed to light but benefits from some protection from harsh midday sun in drier conditions. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity and regular moisture from mist or rainfall. It absorbs water directly from the air and surface moisture; ensure periods of drying between moistening. |

## Introduction
Ramalina is a genus of greenish fruticose lichens that grow in the form of flattened, strap-like branches. Members of the genus are commonly called strap lichens or cartilage lichens. Apothecia are lecanorine.
It is in the family Ramalinaceae and in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
Cartilage Lichen requires high ambient humidity and good air circulation, mimicking its coastal or montane native environment. Provide bright indirect to partial sun exposure and ensure it receives moisture from mist or rain, allowing it to dry out between periods of hydration. No soil or traditional fertilizer is needed.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients directly from the atmosphere (dust, rain, microscopic particles).
