## Care Guide
This plant thrives on neglect, requiring full sun exposure and minimal water, consistent with its arid and montane origins. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot and avoid over-fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. Its native rocky and sandy soils are typically nutrient-poor, so excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
