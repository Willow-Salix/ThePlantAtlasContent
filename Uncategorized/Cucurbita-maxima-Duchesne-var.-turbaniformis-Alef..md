## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate South America (e.g., Argentina, Uruguay, Southern Brazil, Bolivia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Agricultural Zone (characterized by warm, moist summers suitable for cultivation) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and fruit development, reflecting its traditional open-field cultivation. |
| **Watering** | Consistent and ample watering is crucial, particularly during flowering and fruit set, to support the plant's large leaves and developing fruits. Soil should remain consistently moist but not waterlogged. |

## Introduction
Cucurbita (Latin for 'gourd') is a genus of herbaceous fruits in the gourd family, Cucurbitaceae (also known as cucurbits or cucurbi), native to the Andes and Mesoamerica. Five edible species are grown and consumed for their flesh and seeds. They are variously known as squash, pumpkin, or gourd, depending on species, variety, and local parlance. Other kinds of gourd, also called bottle-gourds, are native to Africa and belong to the genus Lagenaria, which is in the same family and subfamily as Cucurbita, but in a different tribe; their young fruits are eaten much like those of the Cucurbita species.
There is debate about the taxonomy of the genus and the number of accepted species varies from 13 to 30. The five domesticated species are Cucurbita argyrosperma, C. ficifolia, C. maxima, C. moschata, and C. pepo, all of which can be treated as winter squash because the full-grown fruits can be stored for months. However, C. pepo includes some cultivars that are better used only as summer squash.
Most Cucurbita species are herbaceous vines that grow several meters in length and have tendrils, but non-vining "bush" cultivars of C. pepo and C. maxima have also been developed. The yellow or orange flowers on a Cucurbita plant are of two types: female and male. The female flowers produce the fruit and the male flowers produce pollen. Many North and Central American species are visited by specialist bee pollinators, but other insects with more general feeding habits, such as honey bees, also visit.
The fruits of the genus Cucurbita are good sources of nutrients, such as vitamin A and vitamin C, among other nutrients according to species. The fruits have many culinary uses including pumpkin pie, biscuits, bread, desserts, puddings, beverages, and soups; they are now cultivated worldwide. Although botanical fruits, Cucurbita gourds such as squash are typically cooked and eaten as vegetables. Pumpkins see more varied use, and are eaten both as vegetables and as desserts such as pumpkin pie.

## Care Guide
Turban Squash requires full sun exposure and consistent, generous watering to support its vigorous growth and bountiful fruit production. It is a heavy feeder, benefiting from nutrient-rich soil amended with organic matter and regular fertilization throughout its growing season.

### Fertilizer
As a heavy feeder, Turban Squash thrives in rich, fertile soil. Incorporate organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure, and provide a balanced fertilizer regimen, especially during active growth and fruit production.
