## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native dry forest habitat. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry out between sessions, and fertilize sparingly as it tolerates lean conditions. Its drought tolerance makes it relatively low-maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Prefers lean to moderately fertile soils. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the growing season, but it is not a heavy feeder.
