## Care Guide
Clasmatodon moss thrives in conditions mimicking its native deciduous forest habitat. Provide low to partial shade and ensure consistently moist, high-humidity environments, avoiding direct sun and waterlogging. Fertilizer is generally not required, as these mosses have minimal nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
