## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in environments mimicking its native riparian habitats, requiring consistently moist conditions and high humidity. It prefers low to partial light and needs minimal nutrients, so avoid over-fertilization. The key is a constantly damp, but not waterlogged, substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. Mosses obtain sufficient nutrients from water and air; excess fertilizer can be detrimental.
