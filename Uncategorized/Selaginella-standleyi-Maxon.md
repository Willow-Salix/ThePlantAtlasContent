## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central America (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Forest Understory |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to deep shade; avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch the delicate foliage. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged; requires very high ambient humidity (70-90%), benefiting from frequent misting or a terrarium environment. |

## Introduction
Selaginella, also known as spikemosses or lesser clubmosses, is a genus of lycophyte. It is usually treated as the only genus in the family Selaginellaceae, with over 750 known species.
This family is distinguished from Lycopodiaceae (the clubmosses) by having scale-leaves bearing a ligule and by having spores of two types.  They are sometimes included in an informal paraphyletic group called the "fern allies". The species S. moellendorffii is an important model organism. Its genome has been sequenced by the United States Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute. The name Selaginella was erected by Palisot de Beauvois solely for the species Selaginella selaginoides, which turns out (with the closely related Selaginella deflexa) to be a clade that is sister to all other Selaginellas, so any definitive subdivision of the species into separate genera leaves two taxa in Selaginella, with the hundreds of other species in new or resurrected genera.
Selaginella occurs mostly in the tropical regions of the world, with a handful of species to be found in the arctic-alpine zones of both hemispheres. Fossils assignable to the modern genus are known spanning over 300 million years from the Late Carboniferous to the present.

## Care Guide
Selaginella standleyi thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical montane forest understory. Provide very low light, consistently moist soil, and extremely high humidity to ensure its success. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted solution, as excessive nutrients can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder; apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength of a balanced fertilizer) every 2-4 months during the active growing season.
