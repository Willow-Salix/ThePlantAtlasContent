## Introduction
Corispermum is a genus of plants in the family Amaranthaceae. Common names given to members of the genus involve bugseed, tickseed, and tumbleweed. In general, these are erect annual plants with flat, thin leaves and topped with inflorescences of flowers with long bracts. Bugseeds are native to North America and Eurasia, but little is known about their taxonomy and distribution.

## Care Guide
Hairy Bugseed thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils, mimicking its native arid grassland habitat. It requires infrequent watering, tolerating drought, and has minimal fertilizer needs for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; native to often nutrient-poor, sandy soils, so apply a balanced, dilute fertilizer sparingly, if at all, during the growing season.
