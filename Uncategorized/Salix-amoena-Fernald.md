## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern North America (e.g., Quebec, Newfoundland, Labrador, northern New England) |
| **Climate** | Cool-temperate riparian and wetland environments |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, ideally 6+ hours of direct sunlight daily, as it typically grows in open areas along waterways. |
| **Watering** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil and does not tolerate drought. Thrives in boggy conditions or near water sources like streams and ponds. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This hybrid willow thrives in cool-temperate riparian zones, demanding full sun and consistently moist to wet soil conditions. It is crucial to prevent drought, making it ideal for landscapes with ample water availability. Provide moderate fertilization in spring to encourage its robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied in spring to support vigorous growth, especially in lean or disturbed soils often found in its native habitats.
