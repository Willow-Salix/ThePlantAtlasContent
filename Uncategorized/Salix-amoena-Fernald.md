## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid willow thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native riparian habitat. Provide full sun for best growth and apply moderate fertilization during the active growing season to support its vigorous nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced fertilizer application during the growing season, especially if soil is poor. Enrichment with organic matter is also beneficial.
