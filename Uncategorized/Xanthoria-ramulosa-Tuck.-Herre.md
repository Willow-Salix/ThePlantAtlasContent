| **Climate** | Temperate Dry-Mesic Woodlands and Open Rocky Areas |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight preferred). Tolerates high light intensity and exposure. |
| **Watering** | Requires intermittent moisture (rain, dew, mist) followed by complete drying. Does not tolerate prolonged wetness or standing water. High humidity or frequent misting can be beneficial, but ensure good air circulation. |

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions with good air circulation. Provide intermittent moisture through misting or natural rainfall, ensuring it dries out completely between periods of wetness. No fertilizer is needed, as it gathers nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain nutrients from airborne particles and rain; conventional fertilizers are harmful.
