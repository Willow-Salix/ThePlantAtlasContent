## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cusick's lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native semi-arid scrubland habitat in the Western U.S. It requires minimal watering once established due to its drought tolerance, and generally does not need fertilizer as it fixes its own nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; avoid high nitrogen as it is a nitrogen fixer.
