## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (coastal regions from North Carolina to Florida and Gulf Coast) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Coastal Dunes/Beaches |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun is preferred, mimicking its open coastal habitat with high light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is ideal, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. This reflects its adaptation to well-draining sandy coastal soils that can be periodically dry. |

## Introduction
Physalis (, , , , from Ancient Greek: φυσαλλίς phusallís 'bladder') is a genus of approximately 75 to 90 flowering plants in the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which are native to the Americas and Australasia. At least 46 species are endemic to Mexico. Cultivated and weedy species have been introduced worldwide. A defining feature of Physalis is a large, papery husk derived from the calyx, which partly or fully encloses the fruit. Many species bear edible fruit, and some species are cultivated.
The typical Physalis fruit is similar to a firm tomato in texture, and like a sweet, tangy grape in flavor. Some species, such as the Cape gooseberry and tomatillo, have been bred into many cultivars with varying flavors, from tart to sweet to savory. Nations including Colombia, India, and Mexico have a significant economic trade in Physalis fruit. The fruits of many species are generically referred to as physalis, groundcherries, husk tomatoes, husk cherries, poha berries, and golden berries.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun conditions, much like its native open coastal environment. It requires well-draining soil and moderate watering, allowing the substrate to dry out between applications. Due to its adaptation to sandy, nutrient-poor soils, it has low to moderate fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It is adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils, so excessive fertilization is not necessary and could be harmful. A light, balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient if needed.
