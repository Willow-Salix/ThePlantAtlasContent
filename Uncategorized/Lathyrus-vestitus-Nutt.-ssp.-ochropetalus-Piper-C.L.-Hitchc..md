## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (California, Oregon, Washington, Baja California) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Chaparral, Woodlands, Coastal Scrub) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full sun, tolerating more sun in coastal or cooler areas and preferring some afternoon shade in hotter inland regions. |
| **Watering** | Water regularly during its active growing season in spring. Once established, it is drought-tolerant and requires significantly less water in summer, mimicking its native dry season. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in well-draining soil under partial to full sun exposure, adapting to its native Mediterranean climate. Provide consistent watering during spring growth, then reduce significantly in summer to align with its natural drought tolerance. Due to its nitrogen-fixing nature, it requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally does not require high nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth appears weak.
