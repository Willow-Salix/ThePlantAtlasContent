## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (specifically Colorado, Wyoming, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Montane/High Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low to very low; drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Lesquerella is the former name of a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Recent work has shown that Lesquerella is indistinct from the genus Physaria and both genera have been united under Physaria. In addition, the former Lesquerella of the southeastern United States have been moved to the genus Paysonia since 2002. The genus Lesquerella is now no longer applied to any species and is considered defunct.
The genus is named in honor of Leo Lesquereux, 1805–1889, Swiss and American botanist.

## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun, the Roundleaf Bladderpod requires well-drained, lean soils typical of its arid montane habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization to maintain its natural vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to lean, rocky, or sandy soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, using a low-nitrogen formula, primarily during the growing season.
