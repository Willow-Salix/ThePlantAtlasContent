| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., California, Arizona) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure; thrives in full, direct sunlight typical of open desert environments. |
| **Watering** | Extremely low; adapted to infrequent rainfall and can absorb moisture from dew or atmospheric humidity. Tolerates long periods of desiccation. |

## Introduction
Thelocarpon is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Thelocarpaceae. The genus was established in 1853 by the Finnish lichenologist William Nylander, who distinguished it from related genera by its warted thallus structure, many-spored asci, and the distinctive violet-blue staining reaction of its fruiting body gel when treated with iodine. These tiny lichens form small, wart-like bumps on soil, wood, and plant debris, often covered with a distinctive bright yellow powdery coating. The genus includes about 30 species found worldwide, many of which produce unusually large numbers of ascospores—sometimes over 300 per spore sac.

## Care Guide
This crustose lichen thrives in conditions mirroring its native arid and desert environments, requiring high sun exposure and extremely infrequent watering. As a lichen, it obtains nutrients directly from the atmosphere and substrate, thus no fertilization is needed for its care.

### Fertilizer
None; lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air, rainwater, and the substrate they grow on, not requiring traditional soil fertilization.
