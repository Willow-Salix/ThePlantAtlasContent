| **Climate** | Temperate Dry Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring open, exposed areas. |

## Introduction
Crepis, commonly known in some parts of the world as hawksbeard or hawk's-beard (but not to be confused with the related genus Hieracium with a similar common name), is a genus of annual and perennial flowering plants of the family Asteraceae superficially resembling the dandelion, the most conspicuous difference being that Crepis usually has branching scapes with multiple heads (though solitary heads can occur). The genus name Crepis derives from the Greek krepis, meaning "slipper" or "sandal", possibly in reference to the shape of the fruit.
The genus is distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and Africa, and several plants are known as introduced species practically worldwide. The center of diversity is in the Mediterranean.

## Care Guide
Crepis rigida prefers open, sunny locations with well-draining, poor to moderately fertile soil, mimicking its native dry grassland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, making it a low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization.
