## Introduction
Lessingia is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae which are native to western North America. Several species are endemic to California.
Lessingias are generally daisy-like in appearance with white, yellow, or purple flowers, but they vary in appearance. Some lessingias are sometimes treated as members of different genera, such as Benitoa. The San Francisco lessingia, Lessingia germanorum, is an endangered species.

## Care Guide
San Francisco lessingia requires full sun exposure and extremely well-drained soil to mimic its native coastal dune and prairie habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing very little water, especially during its summer dormancy, and thrives without significant fertilization. This plant is best suited to dry, sunny, and lean growing conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils typical of its native habitat.
