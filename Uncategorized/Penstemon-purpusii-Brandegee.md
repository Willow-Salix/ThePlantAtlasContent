### *Penstemon purpusii Brandegee*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Sierra Madre Occidental mountains in Mexico (e.g., states of Durango, Sinaloa, Chihuahua) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine to Alpine Scrubland/Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, characteristic of its open, high-altitude native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is accustomed to seasonal rainfall followed by dry periods and excellent drainage in its rocky habitat, making it somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, mimicking its native high-altitude mountain environments. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry completely between applications, as it tolerates drought but not waterlogging. Minimal fertilizer is required for optimal health and flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Its native alpine soils are typically lean and low in nutrients, so rich soils or excessive fertilization can lead to weak, leggy growth and reduced flowering. If used, a very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient.
