| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |

| **Climate** | Temperate Humid Forest/Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light to deep shade; avoid any direct sunlight. It thrives in the understory or sheltered crevices. |

## Care Guide
This moss requires consistently cool, moist, and shady conditions, replicating its natural temperate forest floor environment. Maintain high humidity and constant moisture in the substrate without waterlogging, and avoid fertilizer to ensure its delicate growth.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to no fertilizer needed. Mosses are very sensitive to nutrient salts; if used, apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer very sparingly, once a year at most.
