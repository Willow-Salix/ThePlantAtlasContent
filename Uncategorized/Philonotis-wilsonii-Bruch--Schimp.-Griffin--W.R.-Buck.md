| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions, including Europe (e.g., British Isles), North America, and parts of Asia, particularly in wetlands and fens. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Wetland/Bog |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Shade to Full Shade, avoiding direct harsh sun which can dry out the moss. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist to wet, simulating boggy conditions; never allow to dry out completely as it thrives in saturated environments. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, mimicking its native bog and fen habitats. It prefers partial to full shade and requires very little, if any, fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Mosses are adapted to nutrient-poor environments, deriving most nutrients from water and decaying organic matter; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
