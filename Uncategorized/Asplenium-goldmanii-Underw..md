## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Mexico, Central America (Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama), and Colombia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest (epiphytic in wet forests/cloud forests at low to mid-elevations) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; avoid direct sun as it can scorch the fronds. Dappled shade is ideal. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging; high ambient humidity is crucial, requiring frequent misting or a humidifier. |

## Introduction
Asplenium is a genus of about 700 species of ferns, often treated as the only genus in the family Aspleniaceae, though other authors consider Hymenasplenium separate, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, a different chromosome count, and structural differences in the rhizomes. The type species for the genus is Asplenium marinum.
The most common vernacular name is spleenworts, applied to the more "typical" species. A. nidus and several similar species are called bird's-nest ferns, the Camptosorus group is known as walking ferns, and distinct names are applied to some other particularly well-known species.

## Care Guide
As an epiphytic fern from tropical rainforests, Asplenium goldmanii thrives in environments with high humidity, consistent moisture, and dappled, indirect light. Replicate its native habitat by providing regular watering, high ambient humidity, and very dilute, infrequent fertilization to ensure optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding; a diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) can be applied once a month during the active growing season, mimicking its nutrient uptake from decaying organic matter.
