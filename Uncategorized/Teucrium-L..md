## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, including Southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of Western Asia |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun is ideal, with some species tolerating light afternoon shade, especially in very hot climates, to mimic open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low. Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to replicate native dry summers and prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Teucrium is a cosmopolitan genus of flowering plants in the mint family Lamiaceae, commonly known as germanders. Plants in this genus are perennial herbs or shrubs, with branches that are more or less square in cross-section, leaves arranged in opposite pairs, and flowers arranged in thyrses, the corolla with mostly white to cream-coloured, lobed petals.

## Care Guide
Germander thrives in conditions similar to its native Mediterranean habitat, requiring full sun and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing infrequent watering and very little supplemental fertilizer. Ensure soil dries out between waterings to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in average to poor, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization is generally unnecessary and can lead to leggy growth; a light, balanced fertilizer in spring is only needed if growth appears weak.
