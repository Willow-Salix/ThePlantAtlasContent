# Hairy Hulsea

*Psilochenia bakeri (Greene) W.A. Weber ssp. cusickii (Eastw.) W.A. Weber* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (primarily California and Nevada) |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine zones |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its exposed native habitat above the tree line or on open slopes. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. This plant is adapted to well-drained, rocky soils and can tolerate periods of drought, typical of subalpine summer conditions. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soil, replicating its native alpine conditions. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between sessions, and avoid heavy fertilization to maintain its robust, hardy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Native alpine soils are typically lean and nutrient-poor; rich soil or excessive fertilization can lead to weak growth. If necessary, use a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly once a year in spring.
