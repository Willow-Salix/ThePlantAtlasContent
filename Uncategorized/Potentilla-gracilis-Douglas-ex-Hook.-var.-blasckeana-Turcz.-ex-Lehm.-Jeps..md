## Introduction
Potentilla gracilis, known as slender cinquefoil  or graceful cinquefoil, is a species of cinquefoil. It ranges from Alaska down the west coast of Canada and the United States, and Colorado.
Named varieties are:

Potentilla gracilis var. elmeri (Rydb.) Jeps. – combleaf cinquefoil
Potentilla gracilis var. flabelliformis (Lehm.) Nutt.
This perennial herb is variable in morphology, growing several erect stems up to a meter tall from a branching caudex and rhizome unit. The leaves are palmate and compound, each divided into five to seven wide lance-shaped leaflets with toothed edges. The leaflets are hairy, with many more hairs on the undersides, making them lighter in color than the top surfaces. The basal leaves are borne on very long petioles. Leaves higher on the stem are smaller and reduced. The inflorescence is a cyme of several flowers, each with usually five sepals, lower bracts, and yellow petals.
It is a larval host to the two-banded checkered skipper.

## Care Guide
Slender Cinquefoil flourishes in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native meadowland environment. Water regularly, ensuring the soil remains damp but not waterlogged. Fertilize lightly in spring, as it is not a heavy feeder.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization in spring. Native soils are typically moderately fertile, so over-fertilization is usually unnecessary and can be detrimental.
