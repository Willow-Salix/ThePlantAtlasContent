| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often within temperate forests or woodland edges) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full sun, with protection from intense afternoon sun, especially in warmer climates. Can tolerate more sun than C. japonica. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil. Does not tolerate waterlogging. Regular watering is crucial during dry periods. |

## Introduction
Camellia (pronounced  or ) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Theaceae. They are found in tropical and subtropical areas in eastern and southern Asia, from the Himalayas east to Japan and Indonesia. There are more than 220 described species; almost all are found in southern China and Indochina. Camellias are popular ornamental, tea, and woody-oil plants cultivated worldwide for centuries. Over 26,000 cultivars, with more than 51,000 cultivar names, including synonyms, have been registered or published.
The leaves of C. sinensis are processed to create tea, and so are of particular economic importance in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent, with the processed leaves widely sold and consumed globally. The ornamental C. japonica, C. sasanqua and their hybrids are the source of hundreds of garden cultivars. C. oleifera produces tea seed oil, used in cooking and cosmetics.

## Care Guide
Sasanqua Camellias thrive in partial shade to full sun, protected from harsh afternoon heat, and require consistently moist, well-drained, acidic soil. Emulating their native humid subtropical climate, regular watering and a balanced fertilizer for acid-loving plants will promote healthy growth and abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Prefers rich, organic, slightly acidic soil. Fertilize in early spring with a slow-release, acid-loving plant fertilizer.
