## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (including California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Semi-Arid to Arid Grasslands, Open Woodlands, and Sagebrush Scrub |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun to partial shade. It thrives in open, exposed locations, similar to its native grassland and scrub habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate watering. Water deeply during its active growth period in spring, then allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant, particularly during its summer dormancy. |

## Care Guide
Starlily thrives in full sun to partial shade with excellent drainage, mimicking its native semi-arid environment. Provide moderate water during its spring growth, then allow for dry conditions during its summer dormancy. Fertilization needs are minimal, suitable for low-nutrient soils.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be beneficial in early spring, but it generally thrives without heavy feeding in appropriate soil conditions.
