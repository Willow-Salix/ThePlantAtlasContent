| **Native Origin** | South-central United States (primarily Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Grassland / Dry Prairies |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; drought-tolerant. Water deeply when soil is dry, allowing it to dry out completely between waterings, reflecting its adaptation to periods of dry weather. |

## Introduction
Argemone is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae commonly known as prickly poppies. There are about 32 species native to the Americas and Hawaii. The generic name originated as ἀργεμώνη in Greek and was applied by Dioscorides to a poppy-like plant used to treat cataracts.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native prairie environment. It requires infrequent, deep watering once established, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, and minimal fertilization for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-drained soils, consistent with nutrient levels found in natural grasslands.
