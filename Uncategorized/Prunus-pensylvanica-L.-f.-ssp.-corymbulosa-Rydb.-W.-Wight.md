## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America, specifically temperate and boreal regions of Canada and the northern United States, extending into mountainous areas like the Rocky Mountains. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest and Boreal Forest biomes, often as a pioneer species in disturbed areas, clearings, and forest edges. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours direct sun daily) to partial sun (4-6 hours direct sun daily). Thrives in open, bright conditions, reflecting its pioneer nature. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, especially when young, keeping soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Established plants are moderately drought-tolerant but benefit from consistent moisture during prolonged dry periods. |

## Care Guide
This adaptable North American native thrives in full to partial sun, reflecting its preference for open, bright environments as a pioneer species. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during establishment, but is moderately drought-tolerant once mature. Fertilization is typically minimal, as it tolerates less fertile soils.

### Fertilizer
Generally not heavy feeders. A light application of a balanced granular fertilizer in early spring may benefit young trees or those in particularly poor soil, but it is often not strictly required in average fertile garden soil.
