## 🌱 Overview
Fraxinus (), commonly called ash, is a genus of plants in the olive and lilac family, Oleaceae, and comprises 45–65 species of usually medium-to-large trees, most of which are deciduous (dropping their leaves in autumn), although some subtropical species are evergreen. The genus is widespread throughout much of Europe, Asia, and North America.
The leaves are usually opposite, and mostly pinnately compound (divided into leaflets in a feather-like arrangement). The seeds, known as "keys", are botanically fruits of the type called samara. Some species are dioecious, having male and female flowers on separate plants.
Ash wood is strong and elastic, and used for the handles of tools. Musical instrument makers use it for electric guitars and for drum shells. The Morgan Motor Company makes the frames of sports cars from ash wood. In Greek mythology, the Meliae were the nymphs of ash trees.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Biltmore Ash, native to temperate deciduous forests, thrives in full sun to partial shade with moderate, consistent moisture in well-drained soil. It benefits from spring fertilization in poor soils, reflecting its adaptation to a climate with distinct seasons and fertile forest floors.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, particularly in less fertile soils or for young trees.
