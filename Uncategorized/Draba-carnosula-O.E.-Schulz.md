## Care Guide
Mt. Eddy Draba requires full sun and exceptionally well-drained, lean soil to mimic its native alpine environment. Water moderately during its active growth period, ensuring the soil dries between applications, and avoid heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Naturally adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, and often serpentine soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
