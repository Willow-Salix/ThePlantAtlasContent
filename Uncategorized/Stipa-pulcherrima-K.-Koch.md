| **Climate** | Temperate Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and flowering. |

## Introduction
Stipa is a genus of about 140 species of large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and  spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to Stipa, which have since been reclassified into new genera.
Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as Stipa brachytricha, S. arundinacea, S. splendens, S. gigantea and S. pulchra are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.
It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.

## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun and well-drained soil, Beautiful Feather-grass mimics its native steppe environment. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and little to no fertilization. This makes it an excellent, low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny garden spots.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to moderate to low fertility soils; a light, balanced fertilizer in early spring can be applied if growth seems weak, but it is often not necessary.
