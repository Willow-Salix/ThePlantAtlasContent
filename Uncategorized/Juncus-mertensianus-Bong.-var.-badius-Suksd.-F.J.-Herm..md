## Introduction
Juncus mertensianus is a species of rush known by the common name Mertens' rush or Alaska rush. It is native to much of western North America from Alaska to Saskatchewan to New Mexico, where it grows in wet mountainous areas such as riverbanks and alpine meadows. This is a clumping perennial herb growing from a vertical rhizome. Its smooth, flat stems grow to a maximum height near 40 centimeters. Its few leaves are located at the base and also along the stem. The inflorescence is made up of usually one cluster of many flowers. Each flower has shiny dark brown to black tepals 3 to 4 millimeters long, six stamens with yellowish anthers, and long reddish stigmas, as in image at left. The fruit is a dark, oblong capsule, as in image at right.

## Care Guide
This rush thrives in perpetually wet, even boggy conditions, mimicking its native subalpine wet meadow habitat. Provide full to partial sun exposure and consistently saturated soil. While not a heavy feeder, a light application of fertilizer can support growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Can tolerate nutrient-poor soils but may benefit from a light, balanced fertilizer during the growing season in cultivation.
