## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern Oregon and Northwestern California, USA (specifically Siskiyou Mountains) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Rocky Slopes (characterized by dry, warm summers and moist, cool winters, often with snow cover) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; thrives in high light exposure typical of exposed mountain slopes, but benefits from some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Requires excellent drainage; water moderately in spring, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Keep relatively dry during summer dormancy and in winter, avoiding soggy conditions. |

## Introduction
Lewisia is a plant genus, named for the American explorer Meriwether Lewis (1774-1809) who encountered the species in 1806. The native habitat of Lewisia species is rocky ground and cliffs in western North America. Native Americans ate the roots, which have also been used to treat sore throats.

## Care Guide
Howell's lewisia thrives in well-drained, rocky environments with full sun to partial shade, mimicking its native montane habitat. Ensure excellent drainage and allow the soil to dry completely between waterings, especially during its summer dormancy. It requires minimal fertilizer, adapting well to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs; prefers poor to lean soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in early spring, or no fertilizer at all, is typically sufficient.
