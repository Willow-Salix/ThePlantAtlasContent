## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture during its active growth period, typical of its tropical woodland habitat. Ensure well-draining soil and moderate feeding, while allowing for a drier rest period to mimic seasonal rainfall patterns.

### Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
