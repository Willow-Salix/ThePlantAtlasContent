## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and dry conditions, mimicking its native arid/semi-arid habitats. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings. Avoid over-fertilization as it prefers lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Thrives in lean, well-draining soils and does not require frequent fertilization.
