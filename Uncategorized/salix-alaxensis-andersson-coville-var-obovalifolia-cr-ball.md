## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Alaska, Northwestern Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic/Subarctic Tundra, Boreal Forest margins |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, thriving in open, exposed locations characteristic of its native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil, tolerating seasonal inundation as it naturally grows along riverbanks, floodplains, and wet tundra. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This willow thrives in very cold, open environments, demanding full sun and consistently wet soil. Mimic its native arctic and subarctic riverine and tundra habitats by ensuring ample moisture and good light exposure. While adaptable to poorer soils, it will benefit from moderate nutrient availability for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; capable of growing in nutrient-poor, disturbed soils but will benefit from occasional light fertilization or organic matter to support vigorous growth.
