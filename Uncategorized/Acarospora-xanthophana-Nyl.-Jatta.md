## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in arid to semi-arid regions globally, including southwestern North America (e.g., California, Arizona) and parts of Europe. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland to Semi-Arid Temperate, typically found on exposed siliceous rock surfaces. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to high light exposure, as it naturally occurs on open rock outcrops with minimal shading. |
| **Watering** | Extremely low. This lichen absorbs moisture from atmospheric humidity, dew, and infrequent rainfall. Direct or excessive watering is detrimental; dry conditions are preferred. |

## Introduction
Acarospora is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Acarosporaceae. Most species in the genus are crustose lichens that grow on rocks in open and arid places all over the world. They may look like a cobblestone road or cracked up old paint, and are commonly called cobblestone lichens or cracked lichens. They usually grow on rock (are "saxicolous"), but some grow on soil (terricolous) or on other lichens. Some species in the genus are fungi that live as parasites on other lichens (lichenicolous fungi). Acarospora is a widely distributed genus, with about 128 species according to a 2008 estimate.
Species in Acarospora may be shiny as if covered with a glossy varnish, or dull and powdery looking. They have a diverse range of colors, from the brilliant yellow bright cobblestone lichen, to the dark reddish-brown mountain cobblestone lichen, or they can appear tan, gray, or white, from a dusty-looking coating (pruina). They may grow in crustose forms like a warty surface (verrucose), like cracking-up old crust of paint (rimose), like a bunch of "islands" in a dry lake bed (areolate), like the flakes of cracking up paint are peeling up at the edges (sub-squamulous), or like the flakes are growing over others like scales (squamulous).

## Care Guide
Acarospora xanthophana is a crustose lichen that thrives in dry, sunny, and exposed rocky habitats. It requires extremely low moisture, relying on ambient humidity and infrequent natural precipitation, and needs no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens acquire all necessary nutrients from atmospheric dust, rainwater, and the mineral substrate. Traditional fertilization is unnecessary and can be harmful.
