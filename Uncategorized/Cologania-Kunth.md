## Introduction
Cologania is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It belongs to subfamily Faboideae. It includes 13 species of perennial climbing herbs which range from the southwestern United States through Mexico, Central America, and western (Andean) South America to northern Argentina. Most species are montane, and habitats include tropical to warm temperate montane forest, woodland, thicket, wooded grassland, and open bushland on mountain slopes.

## Care Guide
Cologania thrives in bright conditions from full sun to partial shade and requires moderate watering during its active growth, allowing for soil drying between sessions. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it is efficient in nutrient uptake, needing only light fertilization, especially in average to poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season, particularly in nutrient-poor soils. As a legume, it naturally fixes nitrogen and does not require heavy feeding.
