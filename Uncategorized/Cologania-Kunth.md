## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cologania thrives in bright conditions from full sun to partial shade and requires moderate watering during its active growth, allowing for soil drying between sessions. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it is efficient in nutrient uptake, needing only light fertilization, especially in average to poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season, particularly in nutrient-poor soils. As a legume, it naturally fixes nitrogen and does not require heavy feeding.
