## Care Guide
Selby's Rockcress flourishes in full sun and requires exceptionally well-drained, lean to rocky soils, mirroring its subalpine montane habitat. Provide moderate water, ensuring the soil never becomes waterlogged, and fertilize very sparingly if at all.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to lean, rocky soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental. A very light application of a balanced granular fertilizer in early spring is optional and only if soil is exceptionally poor.
