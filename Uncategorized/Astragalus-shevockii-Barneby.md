## Care Guide
Provide full sun and excellent drainage in lean, possibly sandy or rocky soil, mimicking its native granitic environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and avoid rich fertilizers to ensure its longevity.

### Fertilizer
Requires very little to no fertilizer; its native granitic soils are typically lean, and as a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen.
