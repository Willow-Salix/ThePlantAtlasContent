## Introduction
Dubautia or na'ena'e is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. The genus was named after Joseph Eugène DuBaut (1796–1832), an officer in the French Navy who participated in Freycinet's expedition.
The entire genus is endemic to Hawaii. It contains more species than the other two genera in the silversword alliance, including cushion plants, shrubs, trees, and lianas.

## Care Guide
Provide bright, indirect to partial sunlight and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-draining. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced feed during its active growth period. Protect from intense, direct afternoon sun.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding during the growing season with a balanced, slow-release or liquid fertilizer. Avoid over-fertilization, as it's adapted to naturally occurring nutrient levels.
