## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and surrounding areas) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Dry Woodland / Rocky Slopes |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers ample direct sunlight for optimal growth and flowering, mirroring its exposure on open slopes. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water sparingly and deeply only when the soil has completely dried out. Mimic natural rainfall patterns by allowing long dry periods between watering events to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Sedum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, members of which are commonly known as stonecrops. The genus has been described as containing up to 600 species, subsequently reduced to 400–500. They are leaf succulents found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, but extending into the southern hemisphere in Africa and South America. The plants vary from annual and creeping herbs to shrubs. The plants have water-storing leaves. The flowers usually have five petals, seldom four or six. There are typically twice as many stamens as petals. Various species formerly classified as Sedum are now in the segregate genera Hylotelephium and Rhodiola.
Well-known European species of Sedum are Sedum acre, Sedum album, Sedum dasyphyllum, and Sedum hispanicum.

## Care Guide
Douglas' Stonecrop thrives in conditions similar to its native dry, rocky slopes, requiring abundant sunlight and excellent drainage. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to fully dry between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization to ensure robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Its native rocky and often nutrient-poor soils suggest infrequent feeding. If desired, apply a highly diluted, balanced succulent fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer).
