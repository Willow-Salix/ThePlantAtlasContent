## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy perennial thrives in full sun with extremely well-drained soil, mimicking its native rocky montane habitats. It requires moderate water during its active growth in spring but is very drought-tolerant once established, needing minimal to no water in dry summers. Fertilization should be light, catering to its natural preference for lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it naturally grows in lean, rocky soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if the soil has reasonable organic matter.
