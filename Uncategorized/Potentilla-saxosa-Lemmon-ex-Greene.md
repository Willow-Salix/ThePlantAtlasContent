## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California (southern Sierra Nevada, Tehachapi Mountains) and northern Baja California |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane (Mediterranean-influenced, characterized by dry, hot summers and cool, wet winters, often with snow) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, thriving in open, exposed rocky habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the spring growing season, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring less water during hot, dry summers. Excellent drainage is critical. |

## Care Guide
This hardy perennial thrives in full sun with extremely well-drained soil, mimicking its native rocky montane habitats. It requires moderate water during its active growth in spring but is very drought-tolerant once established, needing minimal to no water in dry summers. Fertilization should be light, catering to its natural preference for lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it naturally grows in lean, rocky soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if the soil has reasonable organic matter.
