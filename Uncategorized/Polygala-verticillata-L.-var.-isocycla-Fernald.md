## Introduction
Polygala is a large genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygalaceae. They are commonly known as milkworts or snakeroots.

The genus name Polygala comes from the ancient Greek "much milk", as the plant was thought to increase milk yields in cattle.

## Care Guide
Whorled Milkwort thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil. Avoid waterlogging while ensuring it doesn't dry out completely for extended periods. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced feed during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light, balanced fertilizer application once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, especially in poorer soils.
