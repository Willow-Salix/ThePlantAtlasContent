| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains, including California, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine to Alpine Tundra/Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (requires intense, direct sunlight due to high-altitude native habitat) |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in environments mimicking its high-altitude native habitat, requiring full sun and excellent drainage. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid heavy fertilization to maintain its natural vigor.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to None (adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky alpine soils; excessive fertilizer can be detrimental)
