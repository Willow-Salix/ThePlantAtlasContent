## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Andes Mountains (Peru, Bolivia, Argentina) |
| **Climate** | Alpine / Montane Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), due to its high-altitude, open habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow soil to dry out between waterings. Alpine plants are accustomed to periods of moisture from snowmelt/rain and good drainage, not constantly saturated conditions. |

## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
Whiteflower Cinquefoil thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, characteristic of its Andean alpine origins. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing to mimic its natural, less nutrient-rich environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; prefers lean, well-draining soil. Over-fertilizing can lead to leggy growth at the expense of flowers, mimicking its naturally nutrient-poor, rocky alpine soils.
