## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Black Booyong thrives in conditions mirroring its native subtropical rainforest, requiring consistently moist, well-drained soil and high humidity. Provide bright indirect to full sun exposure, especially as it matures, and enrich the soil with regular fertilization during active growth to support its vigorous development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate, balanced fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) to support robust growth in typically rich rainforest soils.
