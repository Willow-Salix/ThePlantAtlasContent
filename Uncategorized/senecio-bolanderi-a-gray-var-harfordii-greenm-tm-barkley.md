## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native thrives in partial shade to dappled sun, preferring well-drained soil with moderate moisture during its active growth. It is drought-tolerant once established but appreciates occasional summer water in drier, non-coastal environments. Fertilize minimally, as it is adapted to leaner nutrient conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soil. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, slow-release formula, or not at all if soil is naturally rich.
