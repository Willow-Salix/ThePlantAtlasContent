## Care Guide
This New Zealand native thrives in temperate subalpine conditions, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is a relatively low-maintenance plant that benefits from occasional light feeding to support its growth in varied soil conditions, preferring cooler, brighter environments.

### Fertilizer
