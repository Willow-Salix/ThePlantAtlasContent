## Introduction
Tobacco is the common name of several plants in the genus Nicotiana of the family Solanaceae, and the general term for any product prepared from the cured leaves of these plants. Seventy-nine species of tobacco are known, but the chief commercial crop is N. tabacum. The more potent variant N. rustica is also used in some countries.
Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes and cigars, as well as pipes and shishas. They can also be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, and snus.
Tobacco contains the highly addictive stimulant alkaloid nicotine as well as harmala alkaloids. Due to the widespread availability and legality of tobacco, nicotine is one of the most widely used recreational drugs. Tobacco use is a cause or risk factor for many deadly diseases, especially those affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, as well as many cancers. In 2008, the World Health Organization named tobacco use as the world's single greatest preventable cause of death.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun conditions and is highly drought-tolerant, necessitating infrequent watering only when the soil is dry. It requires minimal fertilization, reflecting its natural habitat in poorer, well-draining soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; as it naturally grows in disturbed and often poor soils, it does not require heavy fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
