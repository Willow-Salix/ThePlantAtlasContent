## Care Guide
Sorensen's Catchfly thrives in full sun with extremely well-drained soil, mimicking its native serpentine outcrop habitat. It requires moderate watering but is intolerant of waterlogging and prefers lean, nutrient-poor conditions, making fertilizer largely unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Very Low to None, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor serpentine soils.
