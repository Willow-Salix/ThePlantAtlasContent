| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate, indirect light. Thrives in deeply shaded or dappled light conditions, typical of forest understories. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is crucial. Requires consistent moisture, absorbing water from ambient humidity and rainfall. Misting frequently or maintaining high environmental humidity is essential; avoid standing water. |

## Care Guide
This lichen requires a consistently humid environment with low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native tropical rainforest habitat. Avoid direct sun and ensure high ambient humidity through misting or a terrarium setup. No traditional fertilizer is needed as lichens derive nutrients from the air and rain.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens do not absorb nutrients from soil like vascular plants. They obtain minimal nutrients from airborne dust and rain, thus traditional fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
