## Care Guide
This Mediterranean plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, exhibiting strong drought tolerance. Water moderately during its cooler growing seasons and reduce frequency drastically during hot, dry summers. Its nitrogen-fixing ability means it requires minimal fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive fertilization is not needed. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in very poor soils, but often it thrives without supplemental feeding.
