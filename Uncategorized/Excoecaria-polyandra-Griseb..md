## Care Guide
Excoecaria polyandra Griseb. thrives in bright light conditions, ideally full sun to partial shade, akin to its tropical dry forest origin in Cuba. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and requires less water during cooler, drier periods. Feed sparingly with a balanced fertilizer during its active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate, using a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer).
