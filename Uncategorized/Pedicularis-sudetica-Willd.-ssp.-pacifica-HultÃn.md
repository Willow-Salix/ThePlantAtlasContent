## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic North America (Alaska, Yukon, Northwest Territories, British Columbia) and Northeast Asia (Kamchatka) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra or Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in open, treeless environments with strong light exposure during the short growing season. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial; native habitat is often wet meadows, bogs, and moist tundra. Soil should remain damp but not waterlogged. |

## Care Guide
To care for Pacific Lousewort, provide full to partial sun exposure and ensure the soil remains consistently moist, mimicking its native wet tundra habitat. Fertilization should be minimal to none, as it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions and is a hemiparasite. Protect from excessive heat and ensure good drainage while maintaining moisture.

### Fertilizer
Very low; native tundra soils are nutrient-poor. As a hemiparasite, it obtains nutrients from host plants. Over-fertilization is likely harmful.
