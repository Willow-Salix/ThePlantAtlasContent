## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Kauai, Hawaii, USA |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest / Montane Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Avoid harsh, direct afternoon sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged. Water frequently, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out slightly before re-watering, mimicking its high-rainfall native environment. |

## Introduction
Cheirodendron platyphyllum, also known as lapalapa, is a species of flowering plant in the ginseng family, Araliaceae, that is endemic to the islands of Oʻahu and Kauaʻi in Hawaii.  It is a small tree, reaching a height of 8 m (26 ft) and a trunk diameter of 20 cm (7.9 in).  Lapalapa inhabits wet forests and bogs at elevations of 670–1,520 m (2,200–4,990 ft).

## Care Guide
Lapalapa thrives in conditions mirroring its native Hawaiian montane wet forest habitat, requiring consistently moist soil and high humidity. Provide bright, indirect light and ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Fertilize moderately during the growing season to support its lush growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength, every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
