## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
This California native is adapted to a Mediterranean climate, requiring full to partial sun and well-draining soil. Water moderately during its spring growing season, then reduce significantly as it becomes drought-tolerant in summer. It has low to moderate fertilizer needs, thriving with minimal supplemental nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Typically thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in early spring is generally sufficient.
