## Care Guide
This hawthorn thrives in temperate climates, preferring full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. It requires moderate watering, particularly when young or during extended dry spells, becoming more drought-tolerant with age. Fertilization is generally minimal, focused on boosting growth if the soil lacks nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced fertilizer in spring is beneficial if soil is naturally poor, but often not strictly necessary in good soil.
