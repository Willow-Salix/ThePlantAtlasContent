## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This montane native thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean to moderately fertile soil. It is drought-tolerant once established but benefits from moderate water during its spring and early summer growth and bloom period. Fertilization is generally not necessary.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soil. Avoid rich fertilizers, as this can lead to leggy growth.
