## Care Guide
As a desert native, this plant demands full sun exposure and excellent drainage. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing to replicate its natural, nutrient-poor habitat.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; thrives in lean, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
