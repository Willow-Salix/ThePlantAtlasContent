## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Boreal and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe (e.g., Scotland, Norway), North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada), and Greenland. |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest, Subarctic Tundra, Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to high ambient light, mimicking the exposure of its host lichen in open tundra or forest clearings. Avoid intense, prolonged direct sunlight, especially in warmer conditions. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist conditions with high ambient humidity, reflecting its native cool, damp environments with regular precipitation, fog, or snowmelt. Avoid waterlogging, but do not allow it to dry out. |

## Introduction
Tremella is a genus of fungi in the family Tremellaceae. All Tremella species are parasites of other fungi and most produce anamorphic yeast states. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies), when produced, are gelatinous and are colloquially classed among the "jelly fungi". Over 100 species of Tremella (in its wide sense) are currently recognized worldwide. One species, Tremella fuciformis, is commercially cultivated for food.

## Care Guide
This lichenicolous fungus thrives in cool, consistently moist environments with high humidity, typical of boreal and subarctic regions. It requires moderate to high ambient light, similar to its host lichen's habitat. No fertilization is needed, as it obtains all its nutrients parasitically from its host.

### Fertilizer
None. As a lichenicolous fungus, it obtains nutrients directly from its host lichen and the surrounding environment. External fertilizers are unnecessary and potentially harmful.
