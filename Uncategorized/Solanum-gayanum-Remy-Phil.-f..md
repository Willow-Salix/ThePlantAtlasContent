| **Sunlight** | Full sun. Requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open scrubland habitat. |

## Introduction
Solanum crispum is a species of flowering plant in the  family Solanaceae. It is native to Chile and Peru. Common names include Chilean potato vine, Chilean nightshade, Chilean potato tree and potato vine. Growing to 6 m (20 ft) tall, it is a semi-evergreen, woody-stemmed climbing plant. The small blue fragrant flowers, 2.5 cm in diameter, with prominent yellow ovaries, appear in clusters in summer. They resemble those of the closely related potato. Very small poisonous berries are produced in autumn. The berries start out green, then yellow-orange, and finally purple.  The leaves are oval.
The specific epithet crispum means "closely curled".

## Care Guide
This Chilean native thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established. It prefers well-drained soil and does not need heavy fertilization, reflecting its adaptation to Mediterranean scrubland environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring, but generally thrives in poorer soils and does not require heavy feeding.
