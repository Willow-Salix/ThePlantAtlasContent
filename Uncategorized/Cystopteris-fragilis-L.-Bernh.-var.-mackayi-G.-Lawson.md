## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (eastern Canada, northeastern USA, south to Virginia and Kentucky) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (Cool, moist, often calcareous rocky habitats) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade. Prefers indirect, dappled light or deeply shaded locations. Avoid direct harsh sunlight which can scorch fronds. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water regularly, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly before rewatering. High humidity is beneficial. |

## Introduction
Cystopteris is a genus of ferns in the family Cystopteridaceae. These are known generally as bladderferns or fragile ferns. They grow in temperate areas worldwide. This is a very diverse genus and within a species individuals can look quite different, especially in harsh environments where stress stunts their growth. They hybridize easily with each other and identifying an individual can be challenging. In general these are rhizomatous perennials which grow in rocks or soil. Their leaves are multiply pinnate, in that each leaflet is divided into smaller parts. The sori are usually rounded and covered in an inflated bladder-like indusium.

## Care Guide
This fern thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded environments, replicating its native temperate forest floor or rocky crevice habitat. Ensure the soil remains damp but well-drained, provide high humidity, and protect it from any direct sun exposure to maintain healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. Use a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., at half strength) once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer). Avoid over-fertilizing.
