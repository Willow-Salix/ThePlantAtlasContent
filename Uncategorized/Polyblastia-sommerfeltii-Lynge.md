## Care Guide
Polyblastia sommerfeltii is an arctic-alpine lichen adapted to harsh, exposed environments. It thrives in high sun and extremely low nutrient conditions, relying on atmospheric moisture for hydration. Cultivation would require recreating a very specific, cold, sterile, and rocky environment that mimics its native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Requires extremely low nutrient levels; no external fertilization needed as it thrives in oligotrophic environments.
