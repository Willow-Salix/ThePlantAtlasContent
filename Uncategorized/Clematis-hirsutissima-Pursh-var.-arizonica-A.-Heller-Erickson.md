## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado), specifically mountainous and high-plateau regions. |
| **Climate** | High Elevation Semi-Arid Woodlands, Montane Meadows, and Pinyon-Juniper Scrub. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, with roots ideally kept cool. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow soil to thoroughly dry out between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established but benefits from occasional deep watering during extended dry periods. |

## Introduction
Clematis is a genus of about 380 species within the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae. Their garden hybrids and cultivars have been popular among gardeners, beginning with Clematis 'Jackmanii', a garden staple since 1862. More cultivars are being produced constantly,  mainly of Chinese and Japanese origin.

## Care Guide
The Arizona Clematis thrives in conditions mimicking its native high-elevation semi-arid habitat, requiring full to partial sun and well-draining soil. It prefers moderate, infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization in spring to support its growth and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer sparingly in early spring, or only if soil is demonstrably poor.
