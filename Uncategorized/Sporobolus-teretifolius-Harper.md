## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Wet Pinelands, Flatwoods, Bogs) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil; does not tolerate drying out, reflecting its native boggy and wet flatwood habitats. High humidity is also beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sporobolus is a nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. The name Sporobolus means "seed-thrower", and is derived from Ancient Greek word σπόρος (spóros), meaning "seed", and the root of βάλλειν (bállein) "to throw", referring to the dispersion of seeds. Members of the genus are usually called dropseeds or sacaton grasses. They are typical prairie and savanna plants, occurring in other types of open habitat in warmer climates. At least one species (S. caespitosus from Saint Helena) is threatened with extinction, and another (S. durus from Ascension Island) is extinct.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wireleaf Dropseed thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, mimicking its native humid subtropical wet pineland and bog habitats. Provide light fertilization during the active growth period to support healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the active growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced, slow-release granular or liquid fertilizer, as native soils can be moderately nutrient-poor.
