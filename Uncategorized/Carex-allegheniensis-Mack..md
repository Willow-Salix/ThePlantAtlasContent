## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This sedge requires consistently moist to wet soil and prefers partial to full shade, mirroring its native habitat in temperate forest understories or streambanks. Ensure high humidity and good organic matter in the soil for optimal growth, with minimal fertilization needed.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in organically rich soils and may benefit from light fertilization annually.
