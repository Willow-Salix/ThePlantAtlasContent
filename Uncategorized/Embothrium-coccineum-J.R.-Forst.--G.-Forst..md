## Care Guide
The Chilean Firebush thrives in cool, moist conditions, mirroring its native temperate rainforest habitat. It requires full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining, acidic soil. Fertilization should be minimal, focusing on low-phosphorus formulations to prevent nutrient sensitivity.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. As a member of the Proteaceae family, it is sensitive to phosphorus; use a low-phosphorus, slow-release fertilizer or enrich soil with organic matter instead.
