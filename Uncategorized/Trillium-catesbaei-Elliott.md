## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily the Appalachian Mountains and surrounding regions) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade, especially protected from intense afternoon sun. Thrives in the dappled light of a woodland understory, receiving more light in early spring before the tree canopy fully develops. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is essential, particularly during the active growing season in spring. The soil should be kept moist but well-drained, avoiding waterlogging. Can tolerate slightly drier conditions during summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Trillium (trillium, wakerobin, toadshade, tri flower, birthroot, birthwort, and sometimes "wood lily") is a genus of about fifty flowering plant species in the family Melanthiaceae. Trillium species are native to temperate regions of North America and Asia, with the greatest diversity of species found in the southern Appalachian Mountains in the southeastern United States.

## Care Guide
Bashful Wakerobin thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate deciduous forest understory. Provide partial to full shade and ensure consistent moisture, especially in spring. Plant in naturally rich, well-draining soil high in organic matter for best results.

### Fertilizer
Prefers naturally rich, well-draining soil high in organic matter. A light annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, but heavy feeding is generally not needed.
