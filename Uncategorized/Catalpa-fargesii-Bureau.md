## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Western China (provinces including Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests (Humid Subtropical) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during the growing season (spring and summer), mimicking its native habitat's rainfall. Once established, it is relatively drought-tolerant but performs best with consistent moisture; allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Catalpa ovata, the yellow catalpa or Chinese catalpa (Chinese: 梓; pinyin: zǐ), is a pod-bearing tree native to China. Compared to C. speciosa, it is much smaller, typically reaching heights between 20 and 30 feet (6 and 9 m). The inflorescences form 4–10-inch-long (100–250 mm) bunches of creamy white flowers with distinctly yellow tinging; individual flowers are about 1 inch (25 mm) wide. They bloom in July and August. The leaves are very similar in shape to those of Paulownia tomentosa, having three lobes (two are abruptly truncated on either edge, with a third, central, slightly acute, pointed lobe forming the leaf apex), and are darkly green. Fruits are very narrow, foot-long pods.
Although native to the more temperate provinces within China (Anhui, Gansu, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jilin, Liaoning, Nei Monggol, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Sichuan, Xinjiang), C. ovata is also cultivated in North America and Europe, and has become a parent of Catalpa × erubescens with the American species Catalpa bignonioides. It is commonly used to make the undersides of qin.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Chinese Catalpa thrives in temperate broadleaf and mixed forest conditions, preferring full sun and well-drained, moderately fertile soil. It requires regular watering during its growing season to support its vigorous growth, reflecting the summer rainfall of its native habitat. Once established, it is quite adaptable and can tolerate some dry periods.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially in less fertile soils, to support its vigorous growth.
