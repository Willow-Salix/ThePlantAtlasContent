## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in very low, indirect light and extremely high humidity, replicating its native tropical rainforest understory environment. Ensure a constantly moist microclimate and avoid all artificial fertilizers, as it obtains nutrients naturally from its surroundings.

### Fertilizer
No artificial fertilizer required. Lichens absorb necessary nutrients from the air and rain; conventional fertilizers can be detrimental.
