## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions similar to its native tropical moist woodland margins. Provide bright indirect to partial sun, ensuring protection from intense afternoon rays. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil and offer moderate fertilization during periods of active growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Fertilize monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
