## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland (Chihuahuan Desert) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive and flower. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent watering; allow the soil to completely dry out between waterings. Water deeply during the growing season (spring/summer) but reduce significantly or cease watering in winter. |

## Introduction
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in conditions mimicking its arid native environment, requiring full sun and minimal, infrequent watering. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings. Fertilize sparingly only during the active growing period.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization; use a balanced, diluted cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer), or none at all if repotted regularly.
