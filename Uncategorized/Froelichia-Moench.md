## 🧤 Care Instructions
Snakecotton is a drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils. It requires minimal watering once established and generally does not need heavy fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny locations.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; thrives in poor to average soils. Over-fertilization can reduce flowering. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year is sufficient, or none at all in typical garden soil.
