## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically mountainous regions of California and Oregon, USA) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, typically thriving in open meadows or forest openings. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture, especially during the growing season, preferring moist but well-drained soils. It's adapted to spring snowmelt and seasonal rainfall, tolerating some summer dryness once established. |

## Introduction
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## Care Guide
Plant Mountain Carpet Clover in an area receiving full sun to partial shade with moist, well-drained soil. Maintain consistent moisture, particularly during active growth, but avoid waterlogging. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it requires little to no supplemental fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required, as it is a nitrogen-fixing legume. It thrives in moderately fertile, unamended soils.
