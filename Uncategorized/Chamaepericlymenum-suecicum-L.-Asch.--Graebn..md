## Care Guide
Dwarf Cornel requires cool, consistently moist, and acidic soil conditions, characteristic of its boreal and subarctic native habitat. Provide partial to full sun, ensuring the soil never dries out completely, and fertilize sparingly as it thrives in lean environments.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. An annual light application of an acid-loving plant fertilizer can be beneficial if growth is slow.
