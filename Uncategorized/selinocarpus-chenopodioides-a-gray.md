| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico (Chihuahuan Desert region) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Chihuahuan Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. Requires direct sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily to thrive, mimicking its native open desert environment. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent and deep watering. As a desert plant, it is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to root rot if overwatered. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Acleisanthes is a genus of flowering plants in the Bougainvillea family, Nyctaginaceae. There are currently 16 species. The generic name is derived from the Greek words ακλειοτος (akleistos), meaning "not closed", and ανθος (anthos), meaning "flower". Plants of this genus are known commonly as trumpets due to the elongated, open-ended shape of their flowers. These are arid-adapted perennials with thick taproots which are usually compact and low to the ground or slightly ascending. An individual plant may have cleistogamous (unopening and self-pollinating) flowers as well as opening flowers which are usually nocturnal as a water-saving adaptation and are pollinated by night-flying or crepuscular insects such as hawkmoths. Flowers are usually white, sometimes yellow. These plants are native to the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts of Mexico and the United States.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native requires full sun and excellent drainage to mimic its arid home. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to completely dry between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing. It is a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very minimal to no fertilizer. Native to nutrient-poor desert soils, it is adapted to lean conditions. If fertilized, use a very dilute, balanced formula sparingly during the active growing season.
