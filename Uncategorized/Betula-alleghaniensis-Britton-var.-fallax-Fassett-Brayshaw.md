## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (including Newfoundland, southeastern Manitoba, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Appalachian Mountains south to northern Georgia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest / Boreal Forest transition |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating more sun in cooler climates or with consistent moisture. As a canopy tree, it needs significant light to thrive. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture; requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, as it is not drought-tolerant and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. |

## Introduction
Betula alleghaniensis, the yellow birch, golden birch, or swamp birch, is a large tree and an important lumber species of birch native to northeastern North America. Its vernacular names refer to the golden color of the tree's bark. In the past its scientific name was Betula lutea, the yellow birch.
Betula alleghaniensis is the provincial tree of Quebec, where it is commonly called merisier, a name which in France is used for the wild cherry.

## Care Guide
The Yellow Birch thrives in cool, moist temperate environments, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, and provide moderate fertilization to support robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or rich organic compost applied annually in spring, mimicking the nutrient cycling of its native woodland habitat.
