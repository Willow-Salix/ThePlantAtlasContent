## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States and Eastern Canada (referring to parent species' native range) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate to Subtropical Bogs and Wet Savannas |
| **☀️ Light** | Full direct sun for at least 6-8 hours daily to ensure robust growth and good pitcher coloration. Can tolerate partial sun but may grow leggy. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently wet soil; typically kept in a tray of distilled, rainwater, or reverse osmosis water, never allowed to dry out. Avoid tap water due to mineral content. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sarracenia ( or ) is a genus comprising 8 to 11 species of North American pitcher plants, commonly called trumpet pitchers. The genus belongs to the family Sarraceniaceae, which also contain the closely allied genera Darlingtonia and Heliamphora.
Sarracenia is a genus of carnivorous plants indigenous to the eastern seaboard of the United States, Texas, the Great Lakes area and southeastern Canada, with most species occurring only in the south-east United States (only S. purpurea occurs in cold-temperate regions). The plant's leaves have evolved into a funnel or pitcher shape in order to trap insects.
The plant attracts its insect prey with secretions from extrafloral nectaries on the lip of the pitcher leaves, as well as a combination of the leaves' color and scent. Slippery footing at the pitcher's rim causes insects to fall inside, where they die and are digested by the plant with proteases and other enzymes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sarracenia ×mandaiana thrives in full direct sunlight and requires continuously wet, nutrient-poor soil, preferably using the tray method with distilled or rainwater. Avoid any traditional fertilizers, as the plant obtains nutrients from insects, and ensure it receives a winter dormancy period for long-term health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required or recommended. Plants obtain all necessary nutrients from captured insects. Fertilizing the roots can be detrimental or fatal.
