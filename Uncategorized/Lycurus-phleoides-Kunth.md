## Care Guide
Common Wolfstail is a resilient grass native to arid regions, requiring full sun and infrequent, deep watering. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs minimal fertilization, making it ideal for xeriscaping or dry, sunny garden spots.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typically does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring may be beneficial but is often not necessary.
