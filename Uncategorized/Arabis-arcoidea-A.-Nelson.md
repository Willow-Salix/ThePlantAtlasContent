## Care Guide
This alpine rockcress needs full sun and excellent drainage to mimic its native high-altitude environment. Water moderately during its active growth period, letting the soil dry out, and use fertilizer sparingly. It requires a cold dormancy for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low, as it naturally grows in lean, rocky soils. A light, balanced fertilizer once in spring, if necessary.
