## Introduction
Clinopodium nepeta (synonym: Calamintha nepeta), known as lesser calamint, is a perennial herb of the mint family known for having fragrant, grey-green, oregano-like leaves with a pennyroyal  smell. It is also called niepita, and mentuccia romana. This plant commonly grows across the Mediterranean, North Africa and parts of Central Asia and has traditionally been used as a folk medicine and culinary herb. A recent study also found cultivars of lesser catmint that had the same compounds in catnip that cause the euphoric effect in cats, known as nepetalactone.

## Care Guide
This plant is a hardy, drought-tolerant herb that thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires well-draining soil and minimal watering once established, tolerating dry conditions well. Fertilization is generally not critical, as it prefers leaner soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soil and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if growth is poor.
