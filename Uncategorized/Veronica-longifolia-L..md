## Care Guide
This speedwell prefers temperate conditions with consistently moist, well-drained soil and a location receiving full sun to partial shade. Ensure regular watering to prevent the soil from drying out, and provide moderate fertilization during active growth for robust flowering.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the growing season, particularly if the soil is poor.
