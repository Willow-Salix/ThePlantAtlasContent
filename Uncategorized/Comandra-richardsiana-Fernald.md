## Care Guide
This hemi-parasitic plant requires a suitable host to thrive, along with full sun to partial shade. Provide moderate, consistent watering in well-draining soil, and avoid over-fertilization as it obtains nutrients from its host. Its adaptability to various temperate environments makes it relatively resilient when its host is healthy.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a hemi-parasite, it primarily derives nutrients from host plants. Direct heavy fertilization is generally not required and focus should be on host plant health.
