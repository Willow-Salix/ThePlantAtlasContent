| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Brazil, South America |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Filtered light to partial shade, typical of a sub-canopy or understory arboreal habitat. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and regular moisture, mimicking frequent rainfall. As an epiphyte, it needs excellent air circulation and does not tolerate prolonged wetness or standing water. |

## Care Guide
This tropical lichen thrives in very high humidity and indirect, filtered light, mimicking its arboreal rainforest environment. It needs frequent moisture from the air or misting, coupled with excellent air circulation to prevent fungal issues. Fertilization is generally not necessary and can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Not typically required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust) and the substrate. Traditional fertilizers can be harmful.
