## Introduction
Machaerina (twigrush) is a genus of flowering plants in the sedge family. Its species occur in tropical America, the West Indies, Malesia, Australia and the Pacific region. The name comes from the Greek machaira (a large knife), alluding to the shape of the leaves in the type species – Machaerina restioides.

## Care Guide
Twigrushes thrive in bright conditions with consistently wet soil, mimicking their native wetland habitats. They require minimal fertilization and can tolerate a range from full sun to partial shade.

### Fertilizer
Low; a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season if growth is poor.
