## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Coastal Ranges of Oregon and California) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Dry-summer subtropical) within Mixed Evergreen Forests, Redwood Forests, and Oak Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Sun to Full Sun. Tolerates full sun in cooler climates or when established, but benefits from some afternoon shade in hotter, drier regions. |
| **Watering** | Moderate, especially when young, requiring consistent moisture during the cooler, wetter growing season (winter/spring). Established plants are drought-tolerant but appreciate occasional deep watering during prolonged dry summers. |

## Introduction
Notholithocarpus densiflorus, commonly known as the tanoak or tanbark-oak, is a broadleaf tree in the family Fagaceae, and the type species of the genus Notholithocarpus. It is a hardwood tree that is native to the far western United States, particularly Oregon and California. It ranges from 15–40 meters (49–131 feet) in height, with a trunk diameter of 60–190 centimeters (24–75 inches). There are a number of radical and incompatible perceptions of tanoak, it has been seen as a cash crop to treasured food plant to trash tree.

## Care Guide
Mutant Tanoaks thrive in a Mediterranean-like climate with distinct wet winters and dry summers, preferring well-drained, rich soil. They require partial to full sun exposure and moderate watering, particularly when young, becoming more drought-tolerant with maturity. Fertilization is generally low, focusing on soil health rather than heavy nutrient supplementation.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. Established plants rarely require heavy fertilization. Young plants may benefit from a balanced, slow-release or organic fertilizer to support initial growth in poor soils.
