## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Utah) and northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant. |

## Introduction
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## Care Guide
Wright's Gilia thrives in conditions mimicking its arid native habitat, requiring abundant full sun and minimal water. Ensure excellent drainage and allow the soil to dry completely between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization needs are low, favoring lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilization; prefers lean soil. A balanced, diluted fertilizer can be applied once early in its growing season, or none if planted in nutrient-rich potting mix.
