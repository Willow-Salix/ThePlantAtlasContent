## Care Guide
This moss requires a consistently moist, humid environment and low to indirect light to mimic its native temperate forest understory. Avoid direct sun and ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues while maintaining high moisture levels.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none; typically obtains sufficient nutrients from decaying organic matter in its substrate.
