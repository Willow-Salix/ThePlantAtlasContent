## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northwestern South America, including Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Bolivia, often in the Amazon basin and Andean foothills. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest / Humid Subtropical |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade; young plants particularly benefit from protection from direct, harsh sun, mimicking understory conditions. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, reflecting high rainfall. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil begins to dry out, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Phytelephas is a genus containing six known species of dioecious palms (family Arecaceae), occurring from southern Panama along the Andes to Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, northwestern Brazil, and Peru. They are commonly known as ivory palms, ivory-nut palms or tagua palms (); the scientific name Phytelephas means "plant ivory" or more literally, "plant elephant". This and the first two of the common names refer to the very hard white endosperm of their seeds (tagua nuts or jarina seeds), which resembles elephant ivory.

## Care Guide
To thrive, the Ivory Nut Palm needs conditions similar to its native tropical rainforests: consistently moist, well-draining soil, high humidity, and bright, indirect light. Provide regular feeding with a palm-specific fertilizer during its active growth phases to support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding during the growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced, slow-release palm fertilizer, reflecting the rich, rapidly cycling nutrients of its native habitat.
