## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Asia (Japan, Korea, China) and Southeast Asia (e.g., Philippines, Taiwan), often in coastal regions. |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical to Tropical Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun but can tolerate partial shade, reflecting its growth in open, exposed areas of its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering, especially during establishment; once mature, it is quite drought-tolerant, adapting to periods of less rainfall characteristic of its native climate. |

## Introduction
Zoysia (UK: ; US: , -, -, -) is a genus of creeping grasses widespread across much of Asia and Australia, as well as various islands in the Pacific. These species, commonly called zoysia or zoysiagrass, are found in coastal areas or grasslands. It is a popular choice for fairways and teeing areas at golf courses. The genus is named after the Slovenian botanist Karl von Zois (1756–1799).

## Care Guide
Mascarene Grass prefers full sun and moderate watering, becoming drought-tolerant once established. It thrives with minimal fertilization, adapting well to a range of soil types if well-drained. This low-maintenance grass is excellent for warm climates and areas where a fine-textured, no-mow groundcover is desired.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs, as it is adapted to generally less fertile coastal or grassland soils; a light, balanced fertilizer application can promote healthier growth.
