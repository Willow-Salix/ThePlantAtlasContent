## Introduction
Prosartes, the fairybells,  is a North American genus of flowering plants in the lily family.
For several decades plants of this genus were considered part of the otherwise Asian genus Disporum. Studies of morphology and cytology, as well as genetic analysis, show these North American plants to be different from the Asian species, and in 1995 the two groups began to be recognized as distinct genera. Prosartes included five species until 2010, when a sixth, Prosartes parvifolia, long considered a variant of Prosartes hookeri, or perhaps a hybrid, was acknowledged as a distinct species.
These plants are rhizomatous herbs with bell-like pendent (hanging) flowers.

Species
Prosartes hookeri - drops of gold - California and Pacific Northwest, plus isolated populations in Black Hills and in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan
Prosartes lanuginosa - yellow mandarin or fairybells - Appalachians, Ozarks, Ontario
Prosartes maculata - spotted mandarin - southern Appalachians
Prosartes parvifolia - Siskiyou bells - southwestern Oregon, northwestern California
Prosartes smithii - largeflower fairybells -  West Coast from Vancouver Island to San Francisco Bay

## Care Guide
This woodland plant thrives in partial to deep shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Avoid direct sun exposure and ensure adequate moisture, particularly during its active growth period in spring and early summer, with minimal need for additional fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from rich, organic-rich, well-draining soil. Supplemental fertilizer is generally not required if grown in suitable substrate.
