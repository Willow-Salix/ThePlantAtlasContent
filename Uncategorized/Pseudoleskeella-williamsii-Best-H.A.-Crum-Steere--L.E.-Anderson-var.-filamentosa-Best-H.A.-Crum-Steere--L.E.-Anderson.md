## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including the Pacific Northwest (e.g., British Columbia, Washington, Oregon) and Rocky Mountain regions (e.g., Idaho, Montana, California). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers low to indirect light; partial to full shade. Thrives in the understory where direct sunlight is filtered or absent. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist substrate and high ambient humidity. Frequent misting is beneficial to maintain surface moisture. Avoid allowing the moss to dry out completely or sit in standing water. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, humid environments with low to indirect light, mimicking its native coniferous forest understory. Maintain consistent moisture in its substrate and provide high ambient humidity, avoiding direct sun and waterlogging. Fertilizer needs are minimal, as overfeeding can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is needed. Mosses have very low nutrient demands, and excessive fertilization can be detrimental to their health.
