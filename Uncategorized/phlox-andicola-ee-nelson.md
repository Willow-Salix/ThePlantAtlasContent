## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy prairie native flourishes in full sun and requires well-drained soil. While tolerant of some drought once mature, it performs best with consistent moisture during its growing season. Avoid excessive fertilization to promote robust flowering and compact growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in average to lean soil. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost once a year is usually sufficient if needed.
