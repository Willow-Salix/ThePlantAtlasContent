## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine lichen thrives in cold, high-light environments with consistent humidity and excellent air circulation. It requires no traditional fertilizer, obtaining nutrients from the air and substrate. Ensure good drainage and avoid stagnant water.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required. Lichens absorb nutrients from the atmosphere and are sensitive to pollutants.
