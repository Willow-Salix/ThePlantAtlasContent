## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in environments with high humidity and bright, indirect light, mirroring its native tropical and subtropical forest habitats. Ensure consistent moisture through regular misting and avoid any traditional watering or fertilization, as it relies on ambient nutrient absorption.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain nutrients from airborne particles and rainwater; conventional fertilizers can be detrimental.
