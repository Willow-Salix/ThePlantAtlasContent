## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central Valley and surrounding foothills of California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Grassland / Vernal Pool Environment |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. It thrives in open, unshaded environments characteristic of grasslands and seasonal wetlands. |
| **Watering** | High watering during its active growing period (late winter to spring) when vernal pools fill, followed by a dry dormancy through summer. Avoid watering during summer dormancy to prevent rot. |

## Introduction
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.

## Care Guide
Alkali Desertparsley needs full sun exposure and ample water during its active growing season in late winter and spring, mimicking its native vernal pool habitat. It requires a dry dormancy period through summer and thrives in lean, alkaline soils without the need for heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to naturally occurring, often lean to moderately fertile, alkaline soils and does not require rich fertilization.
