## Introduction
Heteranthera is a genus of aquatic plants in the water hyacinth family, Pontederiaceae, known generally as mud plantains. Species of this genus are native to tropical and subtropical America and Africa. They live in the water or in wet soils. They produce leaves on long petioles and some are cultivated for their attractive flowers. Leaves are of two types - linear and submerged or orbicular and floating. Some species have cleistogamic flowers.

## Care Guide
This aquatic plant thrives in full to partial sun with constant submersion in water or saturated soil, reflecting its wetland origin. Ensure rich nutrient levels to support its vigorous growth as a water-loving species.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate to rich nutrient levels in the substrate or water column, similar to the fertile muds of its native wetland environment.
