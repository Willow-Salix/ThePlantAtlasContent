## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, consistently moist, acidic soil conditions, mimicking its native bog and tundra environments. Provide partial to full sun and ensure the soil never dries out, while keeping fertilization to an absolute minimum.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. If necessary, use a very dilute acidic fertilizer sparingly.
