## Care Guide
The American Black Elderberry thrives in full sun to partial shade within temperate climates, requiring consistently moist, well-drained soil to mimic its native habitat. It benefits from average to rich soil fertility, making it a relatively easy-care plant when provided with adequate moisture and light.

### Fertilizer
Adaptable to average soil fertility but performs best in rich, organic soil. An annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial.
