## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Paraguay and parts of Brazil |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Grassland/Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers bright direct to indirect light, tolerating full sun in cooler climates but benefiting from partial shade during the hottest afternoon hours in warm regions. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage, mimicking its native habitat near water sources. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, but avoid prolonged dryness or waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Stevia rebaudiana is a plant species in the genus Stevia of the family Asteraceae. It is commonly known as candyleaf, sweetleaf or sugarleaf.
It is a small seasonal plant which grows to a height of 30–60 centimetres (1–2 feet). It has elongated leaves that grow along the stems and are lined up against each other. The flowers are typically trimmed to improve the taste of the leaves. Stevia is a tender perennial native to parts of Brazil and Paraguay having humid, wet environments.

Stevia is widely grown for its leaves, from which extracts can be manufactured as sweetener products known generically as stevia and sold under various trade names. The chemical compounds that produce its sweetness are various steviol glycosides (mainly stevioside and rebaudioside), which have 200–300 times the sweetness of sugar. Stevia leaves contain 9.1% stevioside and 3.8% rebaudioside A.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stevia thrives in conditions similar to its native subtropical grasslands, requiring bright, well-filtered sunlight and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It benefits from light fertilization during its growth period to support its vigorous production of sweet leaves.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeder. Apply a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 3-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer); reduce frequency or cease during dormancy.
