## Care Guide
Pepper Lupine thrives in its native California Mediterranean climate, requiring full sun and well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant once established, needing minimal watering during the dry summer months. As a legume, it has low fertilizer requirements, particularly avoiding excess nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid nitrogen-rich fertilizers which can inhibit flowering. A phosphorus-potassium dominant fertilizer could be used sparingly if needed.
