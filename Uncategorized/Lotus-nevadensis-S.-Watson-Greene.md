## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native arid and semi-arid scrubland habitats. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and requires minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally does not require much supplemental nitrogen.
