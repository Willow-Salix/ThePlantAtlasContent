## Introduction
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).

## Care Guide
This resilient aster prefers full sun and well-drained, average to poor soils, tolerating various conditions. Once established, it is quite drought-tolerant and requires moderate watering, with minimal need for fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean to average soils; over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering. Generally, little to no fertilizer is needed.
