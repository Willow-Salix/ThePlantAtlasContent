## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America, specifically most of Canada and the northern and western United States, from Newfoundland to British Columbia and south to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Georgia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (including deciduous and coniferous woodlands, forest edges, and clearings) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. It thrives and produces more nuts in full sun, but tolerates dappled shade as an understory shrub. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil, especially during establishment. Established plants have good drought tolerance but benefit from supplemental water during prolonged dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hazels are plants of the genus Corylus of deciduous trees and large shrubs native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere. The genus is usually placed in the birch family, Betulaceae, though some botanists split the hazels (with the hornbeams and allied genera) into a separate family Corylaceae. The fruit of the hazel is the hazelnut.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Beaked Hazelnut is a hardy native North American shrub, adaptable to full sun or partial shade. It thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil, though established plants tolerate some drought. This low-maintenance plant generally requires minimal fertilization, making it ideal for native landscaping.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in early spring is sufficient, particularly in nutrient-poor soils.
