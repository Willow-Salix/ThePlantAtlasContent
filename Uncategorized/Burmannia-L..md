# Bluethead

*Burmannia L.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions across Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas (e.g., Southeast Asia, Brazil, Southern United States) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Rainforests, Bogs, and Wet Pine Flatwoods |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light to partial shade. As understory or bog plants, they are adapted to filtered or indirect light and cannot tolerate direct sun. |
| **Watering** | High and consistent moisture. The soil must remain constantly wet or boggy, mimicking their native swampy or damp forest floor habitats. High humidity is also crucial. |

## Care Guide
Bluethead requires a consistently wet and highly humid environment, replicating its native bog or rainforest understory habitat. Provide very low light conditions and use nutrient-poor, acidic soil. Avoid any form of direct fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to none. Many species are mycoheterotrophic (relying on fungi for nutrients) and thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Standard fertilizers are likely to be detrimental.
