## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, from Mexico through Central America to Brazil and Bolivia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Montane Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Avoid intense, direct afternoon sun, which can scorch leaves. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil begins to dry, ensuring good drainage. High humidity is crucial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Miconia is a genus of flowering plants in the glory bush family, Melastomataceae, native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Americas. The species are mostly shrubs and small to medium-sized trees up to 15 m tall. The generic name honours Catalan physician and botanist Francesc Micó. Some species are known by the common name johnnyberry.
Many species are threatened by habitat destruction in their native range, and some are feared to be on the brink of extinction. On the other hand, M. calvescens is a contributing factor in the decline and maybe even extinction of other plants: it has become a highly invasive weed on a number of Pacific Islands where it was introduced, including Hawaii and Tahiti. It is often referred to as the "purple plague" or the "green cancer" in reference to its habit of overgrowing native ecosystems, and its leaves which are bright green above and bright purple below.
Miconia fruit are a favorite food of many birds (invasive M. calvescens spreads by this route). The leaves of some species are eaten by caterpillars of the moth-butterflies (Hedylidae).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical montane plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native habitat: high humidity, consistently moist soil, and bright, indirect light. Protect it from direct, harsh sun and ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
