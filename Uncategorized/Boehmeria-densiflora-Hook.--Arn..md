## Introduction
Boehmeria is a genus of 47 species of flowering plants in the nettle family Urticaceae. Of the species, 33 are indigenous to the Old World and 14 to the New World; no species is indigenous to both the Old and New Worlds. The species include herbaceous perennials, shrubs and small trees. Although related to the similar-looking species of the stinging nettles of genus Urtica, species of Boehmeria do not have stinging hairs. Because of the similarity in appearance, some species are commonly called "false nettles".
This genus is named in honour of the German botanist, Georg Rudolf Boehmer.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native moist forest habitat, preferring bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular fertilization during the growing season supports its lush foliage, while protection from harsh direct sun prevents leaf scorch.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer), reduced in fall and winter.
