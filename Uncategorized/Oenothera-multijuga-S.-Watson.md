## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central United States, specifically the Great Plains region including states like Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie. Characterized by sandy, well-drained soils, hot summers, cold winters, and often semi-arid to sub-humid conditions with periodic drought. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. As a prairie plant, it is adapted to open, brightly lit environments with little to no canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Highly drought-tolerant once established. Requires well-drained soil and prefers to dry out completely between waterings, mirroring the natural rainfall patterns and sandy soils of its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Oenothera is a genus of about 145 species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas. It is the type genus of the family Onagraceae.  Common names include evening primrose, suncups, and sundrops. They are not closely related to the true primroses (genus Primula).

## Care Guide
This Oenothera thrives in full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its native prairie environment. It is remarkably drought-tolerant once established, necessitating infrequent watering and very minimal fertilization to encourage abundant blooms rather than overly lush foliage.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor sandy soils. Excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering. A light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring is sufficient, or none at all in good soil.
