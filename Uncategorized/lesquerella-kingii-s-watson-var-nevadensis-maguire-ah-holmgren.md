## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (Nevada, Utah, Arizona, parts of California), particularly the Great Basin mountain ranges. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Montane/Subalpine, Great Basin Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its high-elevation, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low water needs; it is highly drought-tolerant. Allow the soil to dry out completely between infrequent, deep waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lesquerella is the former name of a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Recent work has shown that Lesquerella is indistinct from the genus Physaria and both genera have been united under Physaria. In addition, the former Lesquerella of the southeastern United States have been moved to the genus Paysonia since 2002. The genus Lesquerella is now no longer applied to any species and is considered defunct.
The genus is named in honor of Leo Lesquereux, 1805–1889, Swiss and American botanist.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Adapted to the dry, rocky slopes of the Great Basin mountains, this plant thrives in full sun and requires very little water, being highly drought-tolerant. It prefers lean, well-draining soil and does not need frequent or heavy fertilization to prosper.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant thrives in poor, rocky soils typical of its native habitat and does not require regular fertilization. Over-fertilization can be harmful.
