## Introduction
Bothriochloa is a common and widespread genus of plants in the grass family native to many countries on all inhabited continents and many islands. They are often called beardgrass, bluegrass or bluestem. Some species are invasive in areas where they have been introduced.
The etymology of the genus name Bothriochloa derives from the two ancient Greek words βοθρίον (bothríon), meaning "small pit or trench", and χλόη or χλόα (khlóa), meaning "new green shoot or blade of grass".
An specimens of Bothriochloa from Gooty Fort Hill, Andhra Pradesh, India was collected in December 2019 and identified as Bothriochloa ewartiana (Domin) C. E. Hubb. based on literature study and international correspondence with experts from Australia, Indonesia and Americas. This study adds an extended and disjunct distribution of a Far Eastern species in Asia from India.

## Care Guide
Silver Beardgrass, originating from South American grasslands, thrives in full sun. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and is drought-tolerant once established. This adaptable grass requires low to moderate fertilization, flourishing in open, sunny environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a native grassland species, it is adapted to less fertile soils and generally does not require heavy feeding.
