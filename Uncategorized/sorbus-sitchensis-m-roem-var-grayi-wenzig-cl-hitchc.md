The genus used to include species commonly known as whitebeam, chequer tree and service tree that are now classified in other genera (see below).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native montane habitat. It requires regular watering, particularly during dry spells, and benefits from light fertilization. Overall, it's a relatively low-maintenance plant once established, adapted to cool, temperate conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization, especially for young plants or in poor soils, using a balanced slow-release formula.
