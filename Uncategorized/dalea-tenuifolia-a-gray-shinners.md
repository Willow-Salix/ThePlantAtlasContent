## 🌱 Overview
Dalea  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as prairie clover or indigo bush. Its name honors English apothecary Samuel Dale (1659–1739). They are native to the Western hemisphere, where they are distributed from Canada to Argentina. Nearly half of the known species are endemic to Mexico. Two species of Dalea (Dalea ornata and Dalea searlsiae) have been considered for rangeland restoration.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient prairie plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring infrequent watering due to its drought tolerance. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it naturally enriches the soil with nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; as a legume (Fabaceae family), it fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere, reducing the need for external nitrogen fertilization.
