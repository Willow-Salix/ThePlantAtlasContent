## Care Guide
Buttonwood thrives in warm, humid conditions with abundant sunlight and consistently moist or wet soil, tolerating brackish water. Ensure it has full sun exposure and frequent watering to mimic its native coastal wetland environment. While adaptable, a moderate feeding schedule can support robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilizer needs; it can thrive in nutrient-poor coastal soils but benefits from a balanced slow-release fertilizer, especially when cultivated outside its natural range.
