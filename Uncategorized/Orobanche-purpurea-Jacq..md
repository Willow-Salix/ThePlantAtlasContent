## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Mediterranean |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. As a parasitic plant, its success is tied to its host, which typically thrives in open, sunny locations. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry between waterings, consistent with its host plants' needs in temperate/Mediterranean climates. It relies entirely on its host for water. |

## Introduction
Orobanche, commonly known as broomrape, is a genus of almost 200 species of small parasitic herbaceous plants, mostly native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere. It is the type genus of the broomrape family Orobanchaceae. It is a weed on broadleaf crop plants in Australia, where some states enforce mandatory destruction and reporting, as well as prohibition of sale.

## Care Guide
Purple Broomrape is an obligate parasitic plant that requires specific host plants (e.g., species of Achillea) to survive. Care involves ensuring the host plant thrives in a full sun, well-drained environment with moderate, seasonal watering, as the broomrape draws all its resources from the host.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; this plant is parasitic and derives all nutrients from its host. Direct fertilization is not effective for the broomrape itself.
