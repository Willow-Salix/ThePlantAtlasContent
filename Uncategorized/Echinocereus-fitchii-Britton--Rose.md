## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South Texas, USA and northeastern Mexico (Tamaulipas) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Chihuahuan Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright direct light for at least 6 hours daily, mimicking its open desert habitat. |
| **Watering** | Water deeply but infrequently during the growing season (spring/summer), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly or stop entirely during its dormant period in winter. |

## Introduction
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## Care Guide
Fitch's Hedgehog Cactus thrives in conditions mimicking its desert home, requiring abundant full sun and minimal, infrequent watering. Ensure well-draining soil and provide very light fertilization during its growth period to promote healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Very light fertilization with a low-nitrogen, high-potassium cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season.
