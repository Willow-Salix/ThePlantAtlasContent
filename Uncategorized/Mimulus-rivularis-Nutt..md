## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
Mimulus rivularis thrives in consistently wet to boggy soil, mimicking its native streambank habitat. Provide full sun to partial shade and moderate nutrients for optimal growth, ensuring it never dries out.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, as riparian soils are often enriched by deposited organic matter; a balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
