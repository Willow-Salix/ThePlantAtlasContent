## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, including southeastern Canada and the eastern United States (from Newfoundland west to Michigan, and south to Florida and Louisiana) |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate to Subtropical Forest, commonly found in wet woodlands, swamps, bogs, and moist thickets. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to Full Sun. While adaptable, it often benefits from some afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates or when soil moisture is less consistent than its native wet habitats. |
| **Watering** | High. Prefers consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native boggy and swampy environments. It has low drought tolerance and should not be allowed to dry out. |

## Introduction
Viburnum is a genus of about 150–175 species of flowering plants in the moschatel family, Adoxaceae or its alternative name Viburnaceae. Its current classification is based on molecular phylogeny. It was previously included in the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae.
The member species are evergreen or deciduous shrubs or (in a few cases) small trees native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species extending into tropical montane regions in South America and southeast Asia. In Africa, the genus is confined to the Atlas Mountains.

## Care Guide
This Viburnum is native to moist, temperate to subtropical wetlands of eastern North America, requiring consistently wet or moist, organically rich soil. It thrives in conditions ranging from partial to full sun, benefiting from afternoon shade in warmer areas. Ensure ample water and enrich the soil with organic matter for optimal health and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Thrives in organically rich soils. Incorporating compost or using a balanced slow-release fertilizer in the spring can support healthy growth, especially in poorer soils.
