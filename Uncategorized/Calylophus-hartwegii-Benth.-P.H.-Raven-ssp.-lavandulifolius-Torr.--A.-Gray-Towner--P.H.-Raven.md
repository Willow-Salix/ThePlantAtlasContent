## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established. It is adapted to lean desert soils, so fertilizer is generally not needed. Mimic its arid native climate for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. It thrives in lean, well-draining soils characteristic of its native habitat and generally does not require supplemental fertilization.
