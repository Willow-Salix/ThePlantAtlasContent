## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright conditions and demands consistently wet, acidic soil, typical of its native bogs and moist pinelands in the southeastern U.S. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils common in bogs and pinelands. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, with a formula suitable for acid-loving plants.
