## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin (Southern Europe, North Africa, Western Asia) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6-8+ hours direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water infrequently, only when the top several inches of soil are dry. |

## Care Guide
Dittrichia thrives in full sun exposure and well-draining, even poor, soil. Mimic its Mediterranean origins by providing ample sunlight and allowing the soil to dry out between infrequent waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Minimal fertilization is needed for this resilient plant.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Dittrichia thrives in nutrient-poor soils; avoid over-fertilizing. A single, light application of a balanced fertilizer in spring is optional if growth appears stunted.
