## 🧤 Care Instructions
Goat's Rue flourishes in full sun and consistently moist soil conditions. As a nitrogen-fixer, it has minimal fertilizer requirements, preferring low-nitrogen options if needed. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry periods, to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has low fertilizer needs and can improve soil nitrogen. If soil is poor, apply a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer sparingly.
