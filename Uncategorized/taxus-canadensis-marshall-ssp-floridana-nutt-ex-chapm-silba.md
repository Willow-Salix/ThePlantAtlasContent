## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Florida Panhandle, USA (critically restricted to specific ravines and bluffs) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (thrives in shaded, moist microclimates within this biome) |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade. Protect from direct, intense afternoon sun, which can scorch its foliage. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil. Does not tolerate drought and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Taxus floridana, the Florida yew, is a species of yew, endemic to a small area of the Apalachicola River. This species has a restricted extent of occurrence of 24km along the Apalachicola River and resides in the mesophytic forests of northern Florida at altitudes of 15–40 m. It is internationally listed as critically endangered, with a declining population. Although this species was previously listed in the Florida endangered species program, it no longer has legal protection under the U.S. or state endangered species programs. However, the bulk of its very limited historically native range is in protective status at Torreya State Park and the adjacent Nature Conservancy's Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Florida Yew requires a cool, shaded environment with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native ravine habitats. Protect it from direct sun and ensure regular watering to maintain its health and support its critically endangered status.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a slow-release, balanced granular fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, particularly in lean soils.
