## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in dry, sunny, exposed environments on rock surfaces. It tolerates long periods without direct moisture, relying instead on atmospheric humidity and infrequent rainfall. No specific fertilization is needed, as it acquires nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer required; obtains nutrients from airborne dust, precipitation, and minerals in its rock substrate.
