## Care Guide
This aquatic moss thrives in consistently wet to submerged conditions, mirroring its natural temperate riparian habitat. Provide moderate to low indirect light and ensure extremely high humidity or constant water saturation to prevent drying. Fertilization is rarely necessary.

### Fertilizer
Very low to minimal. Mosses are not heavy feeders and typically obtain sufficient nutrients from their water source.
