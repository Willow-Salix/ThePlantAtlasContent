## Care Guide
This resilient moss thrives in conditions that mimic its arid native scrubland habitat. It requires abundant light and very infrequent, deep watering, being highly tolerant of desiccation. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, making it a low-maintenance option for dry environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Fertilization is generally not necessary. If desired, a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied once a year.
