## Care Guide
To cultivate Streambank Springbeauty, provide a consistently moist environment with good drainage, akin to its native streambank habitat. It prefers partial to full sun, though in hotter regions, afternoon shade is beneficial. Ensure the soil is rich in organic matter for optimal growth, with minimal need for heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in fertile, well-draining soil rich in organic matter. Light feeding with a balanced, slow-release or organic fertilizer during the active growing season is generally sufficient.
