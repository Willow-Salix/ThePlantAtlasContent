## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South Central United States (primarily Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in open, exposed areas with direct sunlight for a significant portion of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; prefers consistently moist, but well-draining soil, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular moisture during active growth. |

## 🌱 Overview
Minuartia is a genus of flowering plants commonly known as sandworts in the family Caryophyllaceae.
Minuartias are small annual or perennial plants which grow in otherwise inhospitable conditions such as on rocky ledges and in stony soil. Species are distributed in Eurasia and parts of Africa, including Europe, the Mediterranean region, northern and eastern Africa, the Caucasus, western and central Asia, Japan, and Far Eastern Russia.
Many Minuartia species were formerly classed in the genus Arenaria, and the obsolete genus Alsine. In 2014, the polyphyletic Minuartia sensu lato was recircumscribed, with many of the species transferred to other genera, including Cherleria, Eremogone, Facchinia, Mcneillia, Minuartiella, Mononeuria, Pseudocherleria, Rhodalsine, Sabulina, and Triplateia. Minuartia sensu stricto is characterized by the following features: leaves linear-setaceous; 5 acute sepals with 3, 5, or 9-veins; 5 white petals; 3 styles, forming 3-parted capsules.
The genus was named for Juan Minuart (1693–1768), a Spanish botanist and pharmacist.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Texas Stitchwort prefers full to partial sun and well-draining, often sandy soils. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, as it tolerates some drought once established. Fertilization needs are low, typically only requiring a light feed in spring if soil fertility is poor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally adapted to less fertile, sandy soils. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer or compost in spring is sufficient if the soil is particularly poor.
