## Introduction
Boykinia is a small genus of plants related to the saxifrages. It contains at least nine species, known as brookfoams. Brookfoams are glandular rhizomatous creeping perennials with highly lobed or toothed leaves and inflorescences of petite flowers. They are native to North America (the west coast from Alaska to Baja California and the southeastern United States) and Asia (Japan).

## Care Guide
Tall Boykinia thrives in a cool, moist environment with partial shade. Ensure the soil remains consistently damp, never dry, and enrich it with organic matter for optimal growth. Protect it from harsh, direct sunlight to mimic its native understory habitat.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from fertile, humus-rich soil. Amend with organic matter annually and provide a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring.
