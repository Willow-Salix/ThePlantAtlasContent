## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawai'i, USA (endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, specifically wet montane forests on islands like Maui, Kaua'i, and Hawai'i) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. While it can tolerate some morning sun, protect from intense, direct afternoon sunlight which can scorch its broad leaves. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, but well-draining soil. Water frequently to mimic its native habitat's high rainfall, ensuring the soil does not dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Dubautia or na'ena'e is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. The genus was named after Joseph Eugène DuBaut (1796–1832), an officer in the French Navy who participated in Freycinet's expedition.
The entire genus is endemic to Hawaii. It contains more species than the other two genera in the silversword alliance, including cushion plants, shrubs, trees, and lianas.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in conditions that emulate its native tropical montane wet forests, demanding consistently moist, well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. High humidity is crucial for its health, and it benefits from regular, diluted fertilization during its active growth phases.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding. Apply a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler, dormant periods.
