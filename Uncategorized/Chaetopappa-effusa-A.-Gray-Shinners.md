## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native arid and semi-arid habitats. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between applications, and avoid overwatering. Fertilization needs are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to less nutrient-rich environments.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is sufficient if soil is poor.
