## Introduction
Sumac or sumach ( S(H)OO-mak, UK also )—not to be confused with poison sumac—is any of the roughly 35 species of flowering plants in the genus Rhus (and related genera) of the cashew and mango tree family, Anacardiaceae. However, it is Rhus coriaria that is most commonly used for culinary purposes. Sumac is prized as a spice—especially in Iranian cuisine, and other Eastern cuisines—and used as a dye and holistic remedy. The plants grow in subtropical and temperate regions, on nearly every continent except Antarctica and South America.
Native to Persia, it holds cultural significance as a symbolic item on the Haft-sin table during Nowruz, the Persian New Year.

## Care Guide
Fragrant Sumac is a resilient, drought-tolerant shrub thriving in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soils. Water deeply but sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. Due to its adaptation to lean soils, fertilization is generally unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and generally does not require fertilization.
