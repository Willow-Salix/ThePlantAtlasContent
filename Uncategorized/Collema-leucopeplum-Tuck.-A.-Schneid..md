## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions, including western North America (Pacific Northwest, California), parts of Europe, Japan, and New Zealand. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforests and Moist Temperate Forests. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers indirect light to partial shade. Protect from direct, intense sunlight, which can scorch its thallus and inhibit growth. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and frequent moisture, absorbing water directly from the air and rain. Mimic rainfall by misting regularly or maintaining a consistently moist (but not waterlogged) environment. |

## Introduction
Collema (jelly lichen) is a genus of lichens in the family Collemataceae. The photobiont is the cyanobacterium genus Nostoc. Species in this genus typically grow on nutrient-rich bark or somewhat siliceous or calcareous rocks in humid environments.

## Care Guide
Collema leucopeplum thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light, mimicking its native temperate rainforest habitat. Ensure high ambient moisture through regular misting and avoid direct sun exposure. Fertilization is unnecessary and should be avoided.

### Fertilizer
Does not require fertilization. As a lichen, it obtains necessary nutrients from air, rain, and its substrate; external fertilizers can be detrimental.
