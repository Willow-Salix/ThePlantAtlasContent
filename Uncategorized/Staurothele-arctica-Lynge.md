## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arctic lichen thrives in extremely cold, exposed conditions typical of tundra environments, requiring high but low-angle sun exposure. It needs minimal water, relying on atmospheric moisture or snowmelt, and no external fertilization as it derives nutrients directly from its substrate and the air. Mimicking a harsh, barren, and well-ventilated environment is key to its survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain nutrients from the atmosphere and substrate; traditional fertilizers are detrimental.
