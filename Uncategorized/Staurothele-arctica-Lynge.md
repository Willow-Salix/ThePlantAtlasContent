| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic regions, including Greenland, Svalbard, Arctic North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska), and Arctic Russia. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High, direct exposure during daylight periods, tolerating low light intensity during extended dark periods. Adaptable to diffuse light as well. |
| **Watering** | Extremely infrequent, reliant on snowmelt, dew, or atmospheric moisture. Highly tolerant of desiccation; requires prolonged periods of dryness. |

## Introduction
Staurothele is a genus of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), crustose lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. It has about 40 species. When the fungus is part of a lichen, the genus of lichen is commonly called rock pimples.

## Care Guide
This arctic lichen thrives in extremely cold, exposed conditions typical of tundra environments, requiring high but low-angle sun exposure. It needs minimal water, relying on atmospheric moisture or snowmelt, and no external fertilization as it derives nutrients directly from its substrate and the air. Mimicking a harsh, barren, and well-ventilated environment is key to its survival.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain nutrients from the atmosphere and substrate; traditional fertilizers are detrimental.
