## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native Mediterranean scrubland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing infrequent watering with completely dry periods in between. Fertilization should be minimal, as it prefers lean soils and fixes its own nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. Thrives in lean to poor soils. Avoid high nitrogen fertilizers as it is a legume and fixes its own nitrogen.
