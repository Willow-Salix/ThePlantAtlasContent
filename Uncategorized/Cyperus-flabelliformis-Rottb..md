## Care Guide
To mimic its native wetland habitat, keep the Umbrella Plant's soil constantly moist to wet, even allowing it to sit in shallow water. Provide full sun to partial shade and fertilize regularly during its growing season to support robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high fertilization during active growth, as native wetland soils are often rich in organic matter.
