## Introduction
The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, typically orange in colour, though heirloom variants including purple, black, red, white, and yellow cultivars exist, all of which are domesticated forms of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and Southwestern Asia. The plant probably originated in Iran and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. 
The carrot is a biennial plant in the umbellifer family, Apiaceae. World production of carrots (combined with turnips) for 2022 was 42 million tonnes, led by China producing 44% of the total. 
The characteristic orange colour is from beta-carotene, making carrots a rich source of  vitamin A. A myth that carrots help people to see in the dark was spread as propaganda in the Second World War, to account for the reason of British pilots' ability to fight in the dark; the real explanation was the introduction of radar.

## Care Guide
Carrots thrive in full sun and loose, well-draining soil. Provide consistent moisture to prevent cracking and ensure proper root development. Moderate fertilization, especially with phosphorus and potassium, will support a healthy and productive harvest.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Prefers well-draining, loose soil enriched with organic matter. Benefits from balanced fertilizer, particularly those higher in phosphorus and potassium for root growth.
