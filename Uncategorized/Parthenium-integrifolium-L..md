## Introduction
Parthenium is a genus of North American annuals, biennials, perennials, subshrubs, and shrubs in the tribe Heliantheae within the family Asteraceae and subfamily Asteroideae.
The name Parthenium is an evolution of the Ancient Greek name παρθένιον (parthenion), which referred to Tanacetum parthenium. The name is possibly derived from the Greek word παρθένος (parthenos) which means "virgin".
Members of the genus are commonly known as feverfew. Notable species include guayule (P. argentatum) which has been used as a rubber substitute, especially during the Second World War; and also P. hysterophorus, a serious invasive species in the Old World.

## Care Guide
Wild quinine is a low-maintenance native plant that thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering during its active growth but is highly drought-tolerant once established. It prefers average to lean soils and does not necessitate frequent or heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. This plant is adapted to average to lean soils and does not require heavy feeding. An annual top-dressing of compost in spring is usually sufficient if soil is poor.
