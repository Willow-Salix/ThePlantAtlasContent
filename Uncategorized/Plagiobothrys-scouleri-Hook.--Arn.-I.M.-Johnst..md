## Care Guide
This annual thrives in full sun with consistently moist soil, particularly during its rapid spring growth. Mimic its native vernal pool habitat by ensuring ample water early on, allowing it to complete its life cycle and dry back as temperatures rise. Generally low maintenance regarding nutrients once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during early growth if soil is poor, otherwise generally not needed in average to rich soils.
