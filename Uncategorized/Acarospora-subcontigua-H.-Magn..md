## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (USA, Mexico), with occurrences in other arid to semi-arid regions globally. |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid environments, such as high deserts, steppes, or Mediterranean-like climates, typically found on exposed siliceous rocks. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, as it naturally grows on open, exposed rock surfaces in its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent. This lichen relies on atmospheric moisture like rain, dew, or occasional fog, tolerating long periods of drought. Avoid constant dampness; allow for complete drying between infrequent hydration cycles. |

## Introduction
Acarospora is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Acarosporaceae. Most species in the genus are crustose lichens that grow on rocks in open and arid places all over the world. They may look like a cobblestone road or cracked up old paint, and are commonly called cobblestone lichens or cracked lichens. They usually grow on rock (are "saxicolous"), but some grow on soil (terricolous) or on other lichens. Some species in the genus are fungi that live as parasites on other lichens (lichenicolous fungi). Acarospora is a widely distributed genus, with about 128 species according to a 2008 estimate.
Species in Acarospora may be shiny as if covered with a glossy varnish, or dull and powdery looking. They have a diverse range of colors, from the brilliant yellow bright cobblestone lichen, to the dark reddish-brown mountain cobblestone lichen, or they can appear tan, gray, or white, from a dusty-looking coating (pruina). They may grow in crustose forms like a warty surface (verrucose), like cracking-up old crust of paint (rimose), like a bunch of "islands" in a dry lake bed (areolate), like the flakes of cracking up paint are peeling up at the edges (sub-squamulous), or like the flakes are growing over others like scales (squamulous).

## Care Guide
Acarospora subcontigua thrives in conditions mimicking its arid, rocky native habitat, requiring full sun exposure. Provide very infrequent moisture from misting or occasional wetting followed by long dry periods to prevent rot. No fertilizers are necessary as it obtains nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
None required. Lichens absorb nutrients directly from the air and their substrate (rock) and do not benefit from traditional fertilizers.
