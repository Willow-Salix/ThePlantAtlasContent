## Introduction
Stapelia is a genus of low-growing, spineless, stem succulent plants, predominantly from South Africa with a few from other parts of Africa. Several Asian and Latin American species were formerly included but they have all now been transferred to other genera. The flowers of certain species, most notably Stapelia gigantea, can reach 41 cm (16 inches) in diameter when fully open. Most Stapelia flowers are visibly hairy and generate the odor of rotten flesh when they bloom.

## Care Guide
This succulent thrives in bright light and well-drained soil, requiring infrequent watering where the soil fully dries between sessions. Protect it from harsh midday sun and cold temperatures, and fertilize sparingly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Lightly fertilize with a balanced succulent formula during the active growing season (spring and summer).
