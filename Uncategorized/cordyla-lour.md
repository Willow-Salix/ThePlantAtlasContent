## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cordyla plants thrive in full sun conditions, replicating their native tropical savanna environment. They require a distinct wet season with regular watering, followed by a dry period where water is significantly reduced. These hardy plants are drought-tolerant and benefit from moderate fertilization during their active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, so less nitrogen may be required.
