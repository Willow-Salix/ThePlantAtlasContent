## Care Guide
This plant thrives in partial shade, mimicking its native rocky coastal habitat. It requires moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and benefits from light fertilization in spring. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization in spring; use a balanced, slow-release formula. Avoid over-fertilizing.
