## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (endemic) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry to Mesic Shrubland/Coastal Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sun daily) to replicate its exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water moderately but infrequently, as it's adapted to periods of drought in its native dry to mesic environments. |

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its natural dry to mesic coastal and shrubland habitats. Water moderately, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization. Once established, it exhibits good drought tolerance.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice a year during the active growing season is sufficient, as native soils are not typically overly rich.
