## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and very dry conditions, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Provide minimal water and avoid rich soils or excessive fertilization to mimic its natural, harsh environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Native to lean, often rocky soils, this plant does not require rich nutrients and may be harmed by excessive fertilization.
