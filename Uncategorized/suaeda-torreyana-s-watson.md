## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert Salt Flats |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring intense direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent deep watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant and adapted to saline conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Suaeda is a genus of plants also known as seepweeds and sea-blites. Most species are confined to saline or alkaline soil habitats, such as coastal salt-flats and tidal wetlands. Many species have thick, succulent leaves, a characteristic seen in various plant genera that thrive in salty habitats (halophile plants).
There are about 110 species in the genus Suaeda.
The most common species in northwestern Europe is S. maritima. It grows along the coasts, especially in saltmarsh areas, and is known in Britain as "common sea-blite", but as "herbaceous seepweed" in the US. It is also common along the east coast of North America from Virginia northward. One of its varieties is common in tropical Asia on the land-side edge of mangrove tidal swamps. Another variety of this polymorphic species is common in tidal zones all around Australia (Suaeda maritima var. australis is also classed as S. australis). On the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea a common Suaeda species is S. vera. This is known as "shrubby sea-blite" in English. It grows taller and forms a bush.
The name Suaeda comes from an oral (non-literary) Arabic name  for the Suaeda vera species transliterated as suaed, sawād or suēd, and it was assigned as the genus name by the 18th century taxonomist Peter Forsskål during his visit to the Red Sea area in the early 1760s. Forsskål's book, Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica, published 1775, in Latin, declares Suæda as a newly created genus name, with the name taken from an Arabic name Suæd and presents the species members of the new genus.
The genus includes plants using either C3 or C4 carbon fixation. The latter pathway evolved independently three times in the genus and is now used by around 40 species. S. aralocaspica, classified in its own section Borszczowia, uses a particular type of C4 photosynthesis without the typical "Kranz" leaf anatomy.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Torrey's Seepweed thrives in full, direct sun and requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. Due to its adaptation to harsh, saline desert environments, it has very low fertilizer requirements. Providing well-draining, potentially slightly saline soil will best mimic its native habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, saline soils, it rarely requires fertilization. If necessary, use a very diluted, balanced fertilizer sparingly.
