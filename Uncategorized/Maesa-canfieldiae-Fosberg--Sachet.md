## Introduction

## Care Guide
This tropical rainforest plant thrives in warm, humid conditions with indirect light. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil and provide moderate fertilization during active growth to emulate its native Micronesian habitat.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer, reflecting the nutrient cycling from decomposing organic matter in rainforest soils.
