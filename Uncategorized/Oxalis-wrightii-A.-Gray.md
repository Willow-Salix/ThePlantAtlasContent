## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona) and Mexico |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Grasslands and Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers ample light exposure characteristic of open grasslands or under sparse tree cover. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent deep watering. Being native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is drought-tolerant and requires soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Oxalis ( (British English) or  (American English)) is a large genus of flowering plants in the wood-sorrel family, Oxalidaceae, comprising over 550 species. The genus occurs throughout most of the world, except for the polar areas; species diversity is particularly rich in tropical Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.
Many of the species are known as wood-sorrels (also as wood sorrels or woodsorrels) as they have an acidic taste reminiscent of the sorrel proper (Rumex acetosa), which is not closely related. Some species are called yellow sorrels or pink sorrels after the colour of their flowers instead. Other species are colloquially known as false shamrocks, and some called sourgrasses. For the genus as a whole, the term oxalises is also used.

## Care Guide
Oxalis wrightii thrives in conditions mimicking its native semi-arid environment, requiring plenty of sun and infrequent, deep watering once the soil is dry. It is drought-tolerant and benefits from well-draining soil, with minimal fertilization needed to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during its active growing season.
