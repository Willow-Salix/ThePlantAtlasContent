| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically British Columbia, Washington, Oregon) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine Wet Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers bright light but can benefit from afternoon shade in hotter climates to conserve moisture. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, moist conditions with good light, mimicking its native subalpine wet meadow habitat. Ensure consistently moist soil and provide full to partial sun, protecting from intense afternoon heat if necessary. Fertilize lightly in spring for optimal growth, avoiding over-fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring or a diluted liquid fertilizer monthly during the growing season is sufficient. Avoid over-fertilization.
