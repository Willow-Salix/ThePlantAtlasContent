## 🌱 Overview
Syringa is a genus of 12 currently recognized species of flowering woody plants in the olive family or Oleaceae called lilacs. These lilacs are native to woodland and scrub from southeastern Europe to eastern Asia, and widely and commonly cultivated in temperate areas elsewhere.
The genus is most closely related to Ligustrum (privet), classified with it in Oleaceae tribus Oleeae subtribus Ligustrinae.
Lilacs are used as food plants by the larvae of some moth species, including lilac leaf mining moth, privet hawk moth, copper underwing, scalloped oak and Svensson's copper underwing.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Meyer Lilac thrives in temperate zones with full sun to partial shade, appreciating well-drained soil. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and fertilize lightly in spring if needed. This resilient shrub is relatively low-maintenance, requiring minimal pruning.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient; apply a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in early spring if soil is poor, but typically not a heavy feeder.
