## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native arid scrubland environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to completely dry out between irrigations, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Fertilization is generally not needed, as it prefers lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
