## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (including Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolinas), Cuba, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical to Tropical Bogs and Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. While it can tolerate full sun in constantly wet conditions, protection from intense midday direct sun is often beneficial, especially in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist to wet conditions, mimicking its native bog habitat; the substrate must never be allowed to dry out. |

## Introduction
Habenaria, commonly called rein orchids or bog orchids, is a widely distributed genus of orchids in the tribe Orchideae. About 880 species of Habenaria have been formally described. They are native to every continent except Antarctica, growing in both tropical and subtropical zones.

## Care Guide
The Longhorn Bog Orchid thrives in consistently wet, acidic conditions, mimicking its native bog and wetland habitats. It requires bright indirect to partial sun and very high humidity, with the substrate never drying out. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is preferred. If absolutely necessary, use a very dilute (1/4 strength) balanced orchid-specific fertilizer once a month during the active growing season.
