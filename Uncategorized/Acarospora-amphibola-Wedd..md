## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions of Western Europe (e.g., UK, France) and parts of North America (e.g., California) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coastal Biome (specifically exposed rock outcrops in littoral and supralittoral zones) |
| **Sunlight** | High direct sun exposure, tolerant of intense UV radiation and reflected light from rock surfaces. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, natural wetting from rain, mist, or sea spray, followed by complete desiccation; does not tolerate standing water and requires excellent air circulation. |

## Introduction
Acarospora is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Acarosporaceae. Most species in the genus are crustose lichens that grow on rocks in open and arid places all over the world. They may look like a cobblestone road or cracked up old paint, and are commonly called cobblestone lichens or cracked lichens. They usually grow on rock (are "saxicolous"), but some grow on soil (terricolous) or on other lichens. Some species in the genus are fungi that live as parasites on other lichens (lichenicolous fungi). Acarospora is a widely distributed genus, with about 128 species according to a 2008 estimate.
Species in Acarospora may be shiny as if covered with a glossy varnish, or dull and powdery looking. They have a diverse range of colors, from the brilliant yellow bright cobblestone lichen, to the dark reddish-brown mountain cobblestone lichen, or they can appear tan, gray, or white, from a dusty-looking coating (pruina). They may grow in crustose forms like a warty surface (verrucose), like cracking-up old crust of paint (rimose), like a bunch of "islands" in a dry lake bed (areolate), like the flakes of cracking up paint are peeling up at the edges (sub-squamulous), or like the flakes are growing over others like scales (squamulous).

## Care Guide
This resilient rock lichen thrives in exposed coastal environments, requiring full sun, excellent air circulation, and infrequent wetting followed by thorough drying. It obtains all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere and its rock substrate, making traditional fertilization unnecessary. Mimic its natural cycles for successful care.

### Fertilizer
None; lichens derive necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, aerosols) and minerals leached from the rock substrate.
