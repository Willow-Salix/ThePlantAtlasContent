## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Utah, USA (Wasatch Range) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra/Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat above the treeline or in open, exposed barrens. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires excellent drainage, typical of rocky alpine soils, and is drought tolerant once established. |

## Care Guide
Kass' Draba, an alpine plant, thrives in full sun and very well-draining, rocky, nutrient-poor soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization to mimic its harsh native environment.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky soil. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
