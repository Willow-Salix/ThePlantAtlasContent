## Care Guide
Drummond's Campion thrives best in full to partial sun with well-drained soil, mimicking its native temperate montane and grassland habitats. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typically thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient if desired, but often not necessary.
