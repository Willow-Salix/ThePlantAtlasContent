## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Molokaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, USA |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet to Mesic Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial shade to bright indirect light, mimicking its natural understory or mid-story habitat in tropical forests. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil begins to feel dry, ensuring good drainage to prevent root rot, as it naturally receives consistent rainfall. |

## Introduction
Psychotria is a large genus of flowering plants in the coffee family Rubiaceae, with over 1,600 species. The genus has a pantropical distribution and members of the genus are small understorey trees in tropical forests. Some species are endangered or facing extinction due to deforestation, especially species of central Africa and the Pacific.
Many species, including Psychotria viridis, produce the psychedelic chemical dimethyltryptamine (DMT).
