| **Climate** | Temperate Woodlands and Moist Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Sun to Full Sun, preferring partial shade in warmer climates to prevent drying out, but can tolerate full sun where soil remains consistently moist. |

## Introduction
Myosotis ( MY-ə-SOH-tiss) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae.  In the Northern Hemisphere, they are colloquially known as forget-me-nots or scorpion grasses. Myosotis alpestris is the official flower of Alaska and Dalsland, Sweden.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek μυοσωτίς "mouse's ear", which the foliage is thought to resemble. Plants of the genus are not to be confused with the related genus Myosotidium and its sole species Myosotidium hortensia found in the  Chatham Islands.

## Care Guide
Forget-me-nots thrive in cool, moist conditions typical of temperate woodlands and meadows. Provide them with partial shade to full sun (with afternoon shade in hot areas) and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Ensure moderate soil fertility for robust growth and prolific flowering.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. Benefits from rich, organic soil; an annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer is generally sufficient.
