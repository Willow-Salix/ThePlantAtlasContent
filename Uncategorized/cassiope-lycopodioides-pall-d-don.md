## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine heather thrives in cold, exposed conditions with abundant sunlight and excellent drainage. Mimic its native high-altitude environment with consistent moisture (but no waterlogging) and very lean, acidic soil, avoiding rich fertilizers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. If needed, a very dilute, acid-loving plant formulation can be applied sparingly, as native soils are nutrient-poor.
