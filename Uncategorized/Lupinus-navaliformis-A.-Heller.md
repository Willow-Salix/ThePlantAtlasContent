## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral / Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its native habitat in open, exposed scrublands. |
| **Watering** | Low. This plant is drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly during its active growing season (fall to spring) and reduce or cease watering entirely during hot, dry summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
This California native thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soil, characteristic of Mediterranean chaparral environments. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering primarily during its cooler growing seasons. Avoid over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen, to promote healthy growth and blooming.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally does not require supplemental nitrogen. Well-draining, somewhat poor soil is preferred; rich soil can sometimes hinder flowering.
