## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
Lecanora mastrucata thrives in cold, exposed environments with high light and atmospheric moisture. It does not require soil or traditional fertilization, obtaining nutrients from air and rock surfaces, making it highly adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; obtains all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and its substrate. Traditional fertilizers are detrimental.
