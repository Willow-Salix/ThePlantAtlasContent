## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia (e.g., Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea) and parts of Northern Australia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet and Dry Grassland/Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6-8+ hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth, mirroring its open grassland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering is needed during the growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry out slightly between waterings. It can tolerate brief dry periods characteristic of its native climate's dry season. |

## Introduction
Cynodon, from Ancient Greek κύων (kúōn), meaning "dog", and ὀδούς (odoús), meaning "tooth", is a genus of plants in the grass family. It is native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Old World, as well as being cultivated and naturalized in the New World and on many oceanic islands.

## Care Guide
This tropical grass thrives in full sun and requires consistent moisture during its growing season, tolerating brief dry spells. Provide good drainage and moderate fertilization to support healthy growth, mimicking its native grassland environment.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during its active growing season to support robust growth, consistent with nutrient cycling in tropical grasslands.
