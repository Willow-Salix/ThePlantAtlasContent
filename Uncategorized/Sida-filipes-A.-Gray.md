## Care Guide
Sida filipes thrives in full, intense sun, reflecting its native arid desert environment. It is extremely drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering and well-drained soil. Fertilization is rarely necessary for this robust desert plant.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; adapted to lean desert soils. A very light application of a balanced fertilizer in spring is optional.
