## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina, North Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (found in pine flatwoods, sandy open woodlands, prairies) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open, exposed areas typical of its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Prefers well-drained soil and can tolerate periods of drought once established, reflecting its adaptation to sandy soils in a region with regular but not constant heavy rainfall. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Willowleaf Stillingia thrives in full sun to partial shade with moderate, well-drained watering, being quite drought-tolerant once established. It is adapted to lean, sandy soils, meaning heavy fertilization is usually unnecessary. Overall, it requires a relatively low-maintenance approach mimicking its natural, open, and somewhat dry native environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to relatively poor, sandy soils; excessive fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
