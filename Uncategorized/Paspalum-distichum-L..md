## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Americas (North, Central, and South America), particularly in warm temperate to tropical regions. |
| **Climate** | Warm Temperate to Tropical Wetland/Riparian |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily but can tolerate some afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to inundated. Requires abundant water, mimicking its native habitat of moist soils, pond edges, or shallow water. Avoid drying out. |

## Introduction
Paspalum is a genus of plants in the grass family.
The group is widespread across much of Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. Commonly known as paspalum, bahiagrasses, crowngrasses or dallis grasses, many of the species are tall perennial New World grasses. They are warm-season C4 grasses and are most diverse in subtropical and tropical regions.
Paspalum scrobiculatum (koda, varuka, varuku, etc.) is a millet locally grown as food grain. Some species, such as bahiagrass (P. notatum) and P. nicorae, are grown for pasturage, especially with the perennial forage peanut (Arachis glabrata) as a companion crop. Bahiagrass has also some significance as a honey plant.
Water finger-grass (P. vaginatum) resembles bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), but has a higher salinity tolerance and can consume greywater. It is not infrequently used for arena and golf course turf in warmer coastal regions, such as Baja California, Florida, Peru, Texas and Venezuela. Dedicated paspalum cultivars such as 'Aloha Seashore' or 'Platinum TE' have been produced for such uses.
Paspalums are also food for caterpillars of lepidopterans such as the pasture day moth (Apina callisto), and those of the dark palm dart (Telicota ancilla) which feed on P. urvillei. Granivorous birds often eat paspalum seeds; the chestnut-breasted munia (Lonchura castaneothorax) readily feeds on the seeds of  P. longifolium, for example.
The ergot Claviceps paspali is a sac fungus that grows on Paspalum, producing ergot alkaloids and the tremorgen paspalitrem; it causes "paspalum staggers" poisoning in cattle.
Tussock paspalum (P. quadrifarium) is considered a noxious weed in Australia. The term “paspalum” without qualification in Australia refers to the common lawn weed P. dilatatum.  Australia has five native  and approximately sixteen naturalised species.
Daikin Park, the home ballpark of the Houston Astros, has Platinum TE Paspalum as its field surface.

## Care Guide
Knotgrass Paspalum thrives in warm, wet conditions under full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently moist to inundated soil and benefits from moderate to high fertilization to support its rapid growth. Avoid letting the soil dry out.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Benefits from regular fertilization, especially nitrogen, during active growth, given its vigorous growth habit in rich, wet soils.
