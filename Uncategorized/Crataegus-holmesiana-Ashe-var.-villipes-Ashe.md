## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
Holmes' Hawthorn thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring consistent moisture during its active growth period but showing good drought tolerance once mature. It prefers well-draining soil and generally benefits from minimal fertilization, only needing a balanced feed if growth is poor.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically not a heavy feeder. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be applied if soil is poor or growth appears lacking.
