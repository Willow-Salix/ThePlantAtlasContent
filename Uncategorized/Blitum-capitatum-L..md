| **Climate** | Temperate Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and fruit production, but can tolerate some afternoon shade. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist soil but is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Avoid waterlogging, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Strawberry blite (Blitum capitatum, syn. Chenopodium capitatum) is an edible annual plant, also known as blite goosefoot, strawberry goosefoot, strawberry spinach, Indian paint, and Indian ink.
It is native to most of North America throughout the United States and Canada, including northern areas.  It is considered to be endangered in Ohio.  It is also found in parts of Europe and New Zealand.
Fruit are small, pulpy, bright red and edible, resembling strawberries, though their taste is more bland. The juice from the fruit was also used as a red dye by native North Americans. The fruits contain small, black, lens-shaped seeds that are 0.7–1.2 mm long. The greens contain vitamins A and C; they are edible raw when young or as a potherb. If raw they should be eaten in moderation as they contain oxalates. The seeds may be toxic in large amounts.
Strawberry blite is found in moist mountain valleys.

## Care Guide
Strawberry Blite is an adaptable annual plant best grown in full sun with moderate, consistent watering, and relatively low fertilizer needs. Mimicking its temperate forest edge origins, it thrives in well-drained soil and benefits from regular moisture to produce its edible leaves and unique red fruits.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. Grows well in average soil without heavy feeding. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during planting or early growth is sufficient, especially in nutrient-poor soils.
