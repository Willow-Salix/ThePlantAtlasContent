## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically high-altitude mountainous regions of the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada (USA: CA, OR, WA, ID, MT, WY, CO, UT, NV, AZ, NM). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily); tolerates some partial shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. Prefers consistently moist but well-drained conditions, mimicking spring snowmelt followed by periods of drier soil. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Onestem Fleabane, an alpine native, requires full sun and thrives in cool, well-drained, lean soils. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly. Mimicking its mountainous habitat ensures optimal growth, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine beds.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils typical of alpine environments. Excessive fertilization can harm it. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, if desired, is more than sufficient.
