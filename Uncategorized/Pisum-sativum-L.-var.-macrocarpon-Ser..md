## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Near East, Central Asia, and Mediterranean regions (ancestral species) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Steppe, Mediterranean (ancestral species and early cultivation areas) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) as they are open-field crops not typically found under dense canopy. |
| **Watering** | Consistent and regular watering, especially critical during flowering and pod development. Soil should remain evenly moist but not waterlogged, mimicking temperate rainfall patterns during the growing season. |

## Introduction
Lathyrus  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae, and contains approximately 160 species. Commonly known as peavines or vetchlings, they are native to temperate areas, with a breakdown of 52 species in Europe, 30 species in North America, 78 in Asia, 24 in tropical East Africa, and 24 in temperate South America. There are annual and perennial species which may be climbing or bushy.  This genus has numerous sections, including Orobus, which was once a separate genus. The genus has numerous synonyms, including Pisum, the ancient Latin name for the pea.

## Care Guide
Snow peas thrive in full sun with consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Due to nitrogen fixation, they require minimal nitrogen fertilizer, focusing instead on phosphorus and potassium. Regular watering, particularly during flowering, is crucial for good pod development.

### Fertilizer
Low nitrogen requirements due to their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Benefits from moderate phosphorus and potassium. Excessive nitrogen can promote leafy growth at the expense of pod production.
