## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Cascade Range, Oregon, USA (specifically around Crater Lake) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine/Montane Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full sun (prefers partial shade in warmer areas, can tolerate full sun in its naturally cool, high-elevation environment) |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture during the growing season (spring through early summer), allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings; requires well-drained soil and reduced watering in cooler seasons. |

## Care Guide
Thriving in cool, high-elevation conditions, Crater Lake Currant requires well-drained soil and consistent moisture, especially during its spring and early summer growing period. Provide partial shade to full sun, ensuring adequate watering to avoid dryness while preventing waterlogging, and fertilize sparingly.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from a light annual application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring.
