## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal and alpine regions across North America, Europe, Asia, and South America (e.g., Arctic, Alps, Andes, Himalayas) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra to Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. This plant is adapted to the exposed, high-light conditions found at high altitudes and latitudes. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but very well-drained soil. It thrives with constant moisture from snowmelt and rainfall but cannot tolerate waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Phleum (common name timothy) is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the grass family. The genus is native to Europe, Asia and north Africa, with one species (P. alpinum) also in North and South America.
They are tufted grasses growing to 20–150 cm tall, with cylindrical, spike-like panicles containing many densely packed spikelets.

## Care Guide
Alpine Timothy requires full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil to mimic its native alpine habitat, which features melting snow and open exposure. Given its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments, a low fertilization regimen is ideal. Ensure cool temperatures and good air circulation for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilization. Native alpine soils are typically lean, so rich soil or excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
