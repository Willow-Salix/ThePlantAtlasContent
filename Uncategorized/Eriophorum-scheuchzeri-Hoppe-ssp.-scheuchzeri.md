## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions of Northern North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Greenland), Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Russia), and Northern Asia, extending into high-altitude alpine regions globally. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright indirect light, tolerating long periods of daylight exposure typical of high latitudes during the growing season. |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to waterlogged conditions, mimicking its native boggy habitats. The soil should never be allowed to dry out, preferably kept in standing water. |

## Introduction
Eriophorum (cottongrass, cotton-grass or cottonsedge) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae, the sedge family. They are found in the cool temperate, alpine, and Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, primarily in the middle latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia.

## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine plant thrives in perpetually wet, acidic conditions under full sun. Mimic its native boggy environment by ensuring constant moisture, even standing water, and avoid high temperatures and rich fertilizers for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Native soils are typically nutrient-poor and acidic; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
