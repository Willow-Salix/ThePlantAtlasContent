## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical Africa, especially West and Central Africa (e.g., Nigeria, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers bright, direct light for most of the day, as it grows in open areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during the growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry out between waterings. Significantly reduce watering during cooler, dormant periods to mimic natural dry seasons. |

## 🌱 Overview
Crotalaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae (subfamily Faboideae) commonly known as rattlepods. The genus includes over 700 species of herbaceous plants and shrubs. Africa is the continent with the majority of Crotalaria species (approximately 400 species), which are mainly found in damp grassland, especially in floodplains, depressions and along edges of swamps and rivers, but also in deciduous bush land, roadsides and fields. Some species of Crotalaria are grown as ornamentals. The common name rattlepod or rattlebox is derived from the fact that the seeds become loose in the pod as they mature, and rattle when the pod is shaken. The name derives from the Ancient Greek κρόταλον, meaning "castanet", and is the same root as the name for the rattlesnakes (Crotalus).
Crotalaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Endoclita sericeus, Etiella zinckenella and Utetheisa ornatrix. The toxic alkaloids produced by some members of this genus are known to be incorporated by Utetheisia larvae and used to secure their defense from predators.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical African plant thrives in full to partial sun, mimicking its native open grassland environment. It requires regular watering during its active growing season, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and significantly reduced water during drier periods. A balanced fertilizer can be applied occasionally during growth to support its vigor, keeping in mind its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season (every 4-6 weeks). As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen fertilization should be avoided.
