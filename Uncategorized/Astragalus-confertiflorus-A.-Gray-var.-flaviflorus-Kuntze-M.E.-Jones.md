## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and dry conditions, characteristic of its native arid scrubland and desert habitats. It requires minimal water once established and is highly drought-tolerant, making overwatering a significant risk. Fertilizer needs are very low, reflecting its adaptation to poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; this plant is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary, or a very light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring if growth is poor.
