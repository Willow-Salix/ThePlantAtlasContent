## Introduction
Carduus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, and the tribe Cardueae, one of two genera considered to be true thistles, the other being Cirsium. Plants of the genus are known commonly as plumeless thistles. They are native to temperate Eurasia and North Africa, and several are known elsewhere as introduced species. This genus is noted for its disproportionately high number of noxious weeds compared to other flowering plant genera.

## Care Guide
The Nevada Thistle thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native montane habitat. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization. Mimicking its natural conditions, it tolerates dry periods and prefers open, sunny locations.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Thrives in average, well-drained soils; an annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may suffice.
