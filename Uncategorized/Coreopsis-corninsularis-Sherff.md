## 🧤 Care Instructions
This perennial thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native humid subtropical coastal plains. It requires moderate, consistent moisture, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and tolerates some drought once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, as rich soil can lead to leggy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor, well-draining soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if soil is naturally fertile.
