| **🌍 Origin** | Sonora, Mexico and Arizona, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland (Sonoran Desert) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring direct, intense light for most of the day to mimic its desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring deep watering only during prolonged dry spells or intense heat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Vauquelinia, commonly known as the rosewoods, is a genus of the rose family, Rosaceae. It consists of four species of shrubs found in the southwestern United States and northern and central Mexico. The genus was named for French chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (1763-1829). The nectar provided by these plants is commonly fed on by wasps such as Polistes instabilis.
V. californica is of some interest as an ornamental.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun and requires very little water, adapting to long dry periods. Ensure well-draining soil and provide minimal fertilization to mimic its natural arid environment, focusing on drought tolerance and high light intensity for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer needs; native desert soils are often nutrient-poor. Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly (once a year) during the active growing season, or none at all if planted in rich soil.
