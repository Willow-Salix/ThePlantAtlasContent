# Rockcress

*Arabidopsis arenosa (L.) LawalrÃ©e* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern Europe, extending to Scandinavia, the Balkans, and parts of Western Asia, particularly in mountainous regions. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is ideal, mimicking its exposed rocky habitat. It tolerates partial sun but may result in less robust growth. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil is dry, allowing it to dry out completely between waterings. Excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot, as it naturally grows in well-drained, often rocky soils. |

## Introduction
Rockcress is a common name used for several similar genera of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae:

Arabis, with primarily Old World species
Arabidopsis, with primarily European species
Boechera, with primarily North American species
Braya longii, Long's northern rockcress
Sibara, winged rockcresses

## Care Guide
This resilient rockcress thrives in conditions that mimic its native mountainous habitats. Provide full sun, ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging, and allow the soil to dry out between moderate waterings. Minimal fertilization is required, aligning with its preference for lean, rocky substrates.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if grown in reasonably fertile soil. Avoid over-fertilizing.
