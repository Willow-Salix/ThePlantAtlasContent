## Care Guide
This moss requires a consistently moist, high-humidity environment with very low indirect light, mimicking its native forest floor habitat. Ensure constant moisture without stagnation and provide minimal to no fertilization for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. If used, apply an extremely dilute solution sparingly, as mosses are not heavy feeders and can be harmed by excess nutrients.
