## Introduction
Hulsea is a small genus of North American flowering plants in the family Asteraceae known commonly as alpinegold.
Alpinegolds are annual or perennial herbs native to western North America. They produce stout erect stems which may be fuzzy, hairy, or quite woolly. They are leafy, especially toward the base of the stem. At the top of the stem, they bear small daisylike flower heads, with ray florets in shades of yellow to reddish-orange around a center packed with disc florets. The fruits are generally hard and black with a pappus.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant perennial thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils. Mimicking its native Mediterranean montane habitat, provide minimal water once established and avoid rich fertilizers to ensure its vibrant bloom.

### Fertilizer
No significant fertilization is needed; this plant thrives in lean, rocky soils and excess nutrients can be detrimental.
