## 🌱 Overview
Lessingia is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae which are native to western North America. Several species are endemic to California.
Lessingias are generally daisy-like in appearance with white, yellow, or purple flowers, but they vary in appearance. Some lessingias are sometimes treated as members of different genera, such as Benitoa. The San Francisco lessingia, Lessingia germanorum, is an endangered species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lessingia prefers bright, full sun conditions and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid and semi-arid environments. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and generally thrives without supplemental fertilizer, making it a low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. These plants are adapted to lean soils and excessive nutrients can be detrimental. A very dilute, balanced fertilizer might be applied once annually if growth is poor.
