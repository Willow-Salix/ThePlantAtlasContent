## Introduction
Epilobium brachycarpum is a species of willowherb known by the common names tall willowherb, tall annual willowherb, panicled willowherb and tall fireweed. It is native to North America, including Canada from Quebec to British Columbia, the western United States and the Dakotas, and southwestern and Central Mexico. It is a resident of varied open and woodland habitats. It has also been introduced to some areas in South America. This is a tall glandular, hairy annual herb occasionally reaching 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) in height. It is somewhat gangly and thin like an erect weed, with narrow, curving, pointed leaves up to a few centimetres in length. The flower has four petals which may be so deeply notched that they look like four pairs. They are generally light purple or pink, with darker veining. The fruit is a capsule 1 to 3 centimetres (0.39 to 1.18 in) long.

## Care Guide
An adaptable annual plant thriving in temperate, open environments across western North America. It requires full sun to partial shade and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, though it can tolerate some drought once established. Minimal fertilization is typically needed for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder; an annual application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if soil is particularly poor, but often thrives without significant input.
