## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama), Caribbean (West Indies) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Grassland/Pine Flatwoods |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring direct sunlight for most of the day for optimal growth. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the topsoil to dry out between waterings. It tolerates some drought once established but thrives with consistent moisture during active growth, especially in well-draining sandy soils. |

## Introduction
In Greek mythology, the name Chloris (; Greek Χλωρίς Chlōrís, from χλωρός chlōrós, meaning "greenish-yellow", "pale green", "pale", "pallid", or "fresh") appears in a variety of contexts. Some clearly refer to different characters; other stories may refer to the same Chloris, but disagree on details.

Chloris, a nymph loved by Zephyrus (West Wind).
Chloris, wife of Neleus, king of Pylos. It is, however, not always clear whether she or the below Chloris is mentioned in this role.
Chloris, one of the Niobids.
Chloris, daughter of Orchomenus, married the seer Ampyx (son of Elatus or Titairon), with whom she had a child Mopsus who also became a renowned seer and would later join the Argonauts. The Argonautica Orphica calls her by a different name, Aregonis. In some accounts, she mothered Mopsus by Zeus.

## Care Guide
This grass thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils, typical of its native pinewoods habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and apply a low to moderate amount of balanced fertilizer during its growing period. It is generally a low-maintenance, warm-season grass.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer requirements. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, particularly in nutrient-poor sandy soils.
