*Thermutis Fr.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate coastal and montane regions across parts of North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains) and Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, British Isles), often near water sources. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Shade to Bright Indirect Light. Avoid harsh, direct sunlight which can dry it out rapidly. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and frequent direct wetting (e.g., misting, rainfall) are essential. Should not be allowed to fully dry out for extended periods. |

## Introduction
Thermutis is a small genus of cyanolichens in the family Porocyphaceae. It was formerly treated in Lichinaceae, but a 2024 multilocus re-classification of the class Lichinomycetes emended Porocyphaceae and included Thermutis there. Species are minute, dark lichens with ecorticate, often gelatinous to squamulose thalli that occur on rock or soil in open, periodically wet microhabitats. Their sexual structures commonly develop as pycnoascocarps; the asci are prototunicate and the ascospores simple and colourless.
The genus comprises two species: Thermutis compacta and Thermutis velutina.

## Care Guide
Thermutis lichen thrives in consistently high humidity and cool temperatures, preferring partial shade to bright indirect light. It requires frequent moisture through misting or natural rainfall, as it absorbs water and trace elements directly from the environment. Traditional fertilizers are not needed and can be detrimental to its delicate structure.

### Fertilizer
Not required; lichens absorb trace elements directly from air and rain. Traditional fertilizers can be harmful.
