## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains and Intermountain Region, including parts of Canada and USA) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (requires direct sun exposure typical of high-altitude open areas) |
| **Watering** | Moderate (needs consistent moisture during the growing season, but absolutely requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot, as found in rocky alpine soils) |

## Introduction
Cerastium is a genus of annual, winter annual, or perennial flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. They are commonly called mouse-ears or mouse-ear chickweeds. There are 214 accepted species, found nearly worldwide but with the greatest concentration in the northern temperate regions. A number of the species are common weeds in fields and on disturbed ground.

Cerastium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora chalcogrammella (which feeds exclusively on Cerastium arvense) and Coleophora striatipennella (which has been recorded on Cerastium fontanum).

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soil. Provide moderate watering during its active growth period, ensuring no waterlogging. Mimic its rocky, high-altitude origins to ensure success.

### Fertilizer
Minimal (thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its native alpine habitat)
