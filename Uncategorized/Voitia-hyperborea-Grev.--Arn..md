# Voitia Moss

*Voitia hyperborea Grev. & Arn.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including Arctic and Subarctic North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska), Greenland, Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia), and Northern Asia. |
| **Climate** | Arctic and Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect to filtered light. Avoid direct, intense sunlight, especially during midday, as it thrives in the cooler, often lower-light conditions of its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged, mimicking the perpetually damp conditions of its tundra habitat. High humidity is essential; consider misting or a terrarium environment. |

## Care Guide
Voitia moss requires consistently cool and humid conditions with a consistently moist substrate, reminiscent of its native Arctic and Alpine Tundra environment. Provide bright indirect light and avoid direct sun and high temperatures, as it is not tolerant of drought or nutrient-rich soils.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Tundra soils are nutrient-poor; use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly (e.g., once or twice a year) or rely on the substrate's natural nutrients.
