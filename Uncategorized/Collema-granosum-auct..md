## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate to warm-temperate regions, including Europe (especially the Mediterranean Basin) and North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate and Mediterranean Rocky Landscapes |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to high indirect light, tolerating periods of direct sunlight, especially in cooler parts of the day or year. |
| **Watering** | Frequent misting or rehydration is essential to keep the thallus moist; allow for brief dry periods between rehydrations to mimic natural cycles, but avoid prolonged drought. |

## Introduction
Collema (jelly lichen) is a genus of lichens in the family Collemataceae. The photobiont is the cyanobacterium genus Nostoc. Species in this genus typically grow on nutrient-rich bark or somewhat siliceous or calcareous rocks in humid environments.

## Care Guide
This Collema lichen thrives in temperate to Mediterranean conditions, typically found on calcareous rocks and requiring consistent moisture and good light. Provide frequent rehydration through misting or rain, ensuring the thallus remains moist while allowing for brief dry spells. Moderate to high indirect light is preferred, and no supplemental fertilizer is needed as it naturally absorbs nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
No supplemental fertilizer is required; this lichen obtains all necessary nutrients from the air, rainwater, and its substrate.
