## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin regions (e.g., Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California, Oregon, Washington). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Dry Forest and Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun, especially in cooler climates or higher altitudes, but can tolerate some partial shade. Requires bright light for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently but deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. |

## Care Guide
Holboell's Rockcress is a resilient plant adapted to the dry, rocky conditions of Western North American montane environments. It requires ample sunlight and excellent drainage, thriving with minimal water and lean soil. This makes it an ideal, low-maintenance choice for xeriscaping or rock gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all, is generally sufficient.
