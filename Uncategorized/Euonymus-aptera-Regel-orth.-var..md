## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil, reflecting its native semi-arid steppe and mountainous habitats of Central Asia. It requires moderate to low watering, becoming highly drought-tolerant once established. Fertilizer needs are minimal, ensuring robust growth without excessive intervention.

### Fertilizer
Low; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil is poor, otherwise minimal feeding is needed.
