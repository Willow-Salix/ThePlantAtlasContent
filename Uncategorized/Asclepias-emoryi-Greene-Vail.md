## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Semi-arid Grasslands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly during cooler, dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Asclepias is a genus of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants known as milkweeds, named for their latex, a milky substance containing cardiac glycosides termed cardenolides, exuded where cells are damaged. Most species are toxic to humans and many other species, primarily due to the presence of cardenolides. However, as with many such plants, some species feed upon milkweed leaves or the nectar from their flowers. A noteworthy feeder on milkweeds is the monarch butterfly, which uses and requires certain milkweeds as host plants for its larvae.
The Asclepias genus contains over 200 species distributed broadly across Africa, North America, and South America. It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.

## Care Guide
Emory's Milkweed thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, mirroring its native arid scrubland conditions. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and has low nutrient needs, making it a low-maintenance plant once established.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to average soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial but is often not necessary.
