## Introduction
Didymoglossum is a tropical genus of ferns in the family Hymenophyllaceae. It comprises more than 30 epilithic or low-epiphytic species under two subgenera. The genus is accepted in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), but not by some other sources which sink it into a broadly defined Trichomanes.

## Care Guide
This delicate filmy fern thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest understory habitat, demanding extremely high humidity and deep shade. It requires a consistently moist environment and must never be allowed to dry out, making terrarium cultivation essential for success.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is needed. If fertilizing, use a very highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/8 to 1/10 strength) infrequently, only during active growth.
