## Care Guide
Italian Buckthorn is a resilient plant perfectly suited for full sun and well-draining conditions, mirroring its Mediterranean origins. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and generally low fertilization, making it a low-maintenance landscape choice.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to nutrient-poor, well-draining soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary in good soil, but a light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer can be given in spring if growth is stagnant.
