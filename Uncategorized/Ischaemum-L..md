Ischaemum is a genus in the tribe Andropogoneae, belonging to the grass family, widespread in tropical and semitropical regions in many countries. Many species are known commonly as murainagrass.
In 2022, Shahid Nawaz (an agrostologist, The Blatter Herbarium (BLAT)) described an unusual species in the genus characterised by its dioecious breeding system, it was named as Ischaemum dioecum Landge & R.D. Shinde. This species is endemic to a couple of locations in Western Ghats of Raigad district, Maharashtra, India. The male and female plants are sexually separate individuals and occupy similar ecological niches. This is the only dioecious species in the tribe Andropogoneae.
