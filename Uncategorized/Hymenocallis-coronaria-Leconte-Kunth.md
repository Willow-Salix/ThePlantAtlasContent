## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical, specifically freshwater riverine and wetland environments (shoals, stream banks) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers full sun for optimal growth and flowering, mimicking its exposed habitat in river shoals. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently wet to saturated soil, or even shallow submersion. Cannot tolerate drying out, as it naturally grows in moving water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hymenocallis  (US) or  (UK) is a genus of flowering plants in the amaryllis family native to the Americas.
Hymenocallis contains more than 60 species of herbaceous bulbous perennials native to the southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. Some species are cultivated as ornamentals in warm nations around the globe, and a few have become naturalized in parts of Africa and on various tropical islands. Many of the species from the Caribbean and from the southeastern United States inhabit wet areas such as marshes, streambanks, and seashores. Some species even have floating seeds. Some of the Mexican species, in contrast, grow on grassy slopes in hills and mountains.
The flower stalks arise from basal rosettes of strap-shaped leaves. The terminal clusters of fragrant flowers are green, white or yellow, and can be large and spectacular. The genus name is derived from the Greek words ὑμήν (hymen), meaning "membrane", and καλός (kalos), meaning "beautiful".  It refers to the curious shape of the flowers, which consist of six narrow, curved petals attached to a shallow cup that is formed from the fused stamens. The effect is of a spidery daffodil or lily, thus explaining the common name "spider lily".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To mimic its native river shoal habitat, the Shoals Spiderlily demands full sun and constantly wet or saturated soil, never allowing it to dry out. Provide abundant water consistently, even allowing for shallow submersion. Light fertilization during its active growth period will support robust flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season is beneficial, especially when not in its natural nutrient-rich aquatic environment.
