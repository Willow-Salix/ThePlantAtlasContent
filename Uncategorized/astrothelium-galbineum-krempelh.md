## 🌱 Overview
Astrothelium is a large genus of corticolous (bark-dwelling) lichens in the family Trypetheliaceae. The genus is characterized by a corticate thallus and diverse ascomata structures, which can be simple, aggregated, or forming pseudostromata. Astrothelium is also notable for the carbonized walls of its ascomata, the so-called textura intricata (i.e., tightly interwoven) arrangement of cells in these walls, and various forms of distoseptate, transparent spores.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Astrothelium lichen requires a high humidity environment, mimicking its tropical rainforest origin. Provide indirect or low light exposure and ensure consistent atmospheric moisture through frequent misting or placement in a humid terrarium. Conventional fertilizers should be avoided as they are not beneficial and can be detrimental.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens obtain necessary nutrients directly from the air and rainwater, making conventional fertilizers unnecessary and potentially harmful.
