## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including the Southwestern United States (e.g., California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah) and northern Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert Biome |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, reflecting its growth in open, unshaded environments. |
| **Watering** | Extremely low; this plant is highly drought-tolerant and prefers infrequent, deep waterings, allowing the soil to dry completely between applications. Overwatering should be avoided. |

## Introduction
Ericameria is a genus of North American shrubs in the family Asteraceae.
Ericameria is known by the common names goldenbush, rabbitbrush, turpentine bush, and rabbitbush. Most are shrubs, but one species (E. parishii) can reach tree stature. They are distributed in western Canada (Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia) western United States (from the western Great Plains to the Pacific) and northern Mexico. Bright yellow flower heads adorn the plants in late summer. All the species have disc florets, while some have ray florets but others do not. Ericameria nauseosa, (synonym Chrysothamnus nauseosus), is known for its production of latex.

## Care Guide
Goldenbush is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant perfectly suited for xeriscaping, requiring full sun and minimal water. It adapts well to poor, well-draining soils and generally does not need fertilization. Ensure good drainage and avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Very low; goldenbush thrives in lean, well-draining soils typical of its native habitat and generally does not require fertilization. If growth is poor, a very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer could be applied sparingly in spring.
