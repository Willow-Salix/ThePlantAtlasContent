## Care Guide
Canada Goldenrod is a highly adaptable plant that flourishes in full sun and temperate conditions typical of its native North American prairies and open fields. It requires moderate watering to establish but becomes quite drought-tolerant. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it naturally thrives in a variety of soil types.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally thrives in average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization. An annual light application of balanced fertilizer may be beneficial in very poor soils.
