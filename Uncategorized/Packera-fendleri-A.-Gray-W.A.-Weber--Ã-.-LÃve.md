## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (primarily Rocky Mountains and surrounding areas, including Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming) |
| **Climate** | Montane/Subalpine Grassland and Open Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, reflecting its growth in open meadows, rocky slopes, and under open tree canopies. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow soil to dry out between waterings. Its native habitat experiences periods of moisture (snowmelt, summer rains) followed by drier conditions, requiring good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Packera is a genus of about 75 species of plants in the daisy family, Asteraceae. Most species are commonly called ragworts or grounsels. Its members were previously included in the genus Senecio (where they were called aureoid senecios by Asa Gray), but were moved to genus Packera based on chromosome numbers, a variety of morphological characters, and molecular phylogenetic evidence.

## Care Guide
Fendler's ragwort thrives in full to partial sun, typical of its native montane meadows and open forests. It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and has low to moderate fertilizer requirements. Mimic its native conditions for best growth, ensuring good drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It is adapted to less fertile, often rocky soils found in its native montane environment, so excessive fertilization is not necessary and can lead to leggy growth.
