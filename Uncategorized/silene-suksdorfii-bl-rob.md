## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Pacific Northwest, Northern Rocky Mountains - USA and Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. As an alpine plant, it thrives in open, exposed locations with high light intensity. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Native habitat experiences significant snowmelt and summer moisture but also well-drained, rocky soils. Water consistently, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot, ensuring excellent drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Silene is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. Containing nearly 900 species, it is the largest genus in the family. Common names include campion and catchfly. Many Silene species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Suksdorf's silene requires full to partial sun and excellent drainage, mimicking its native alpine environment. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between sessions, and fertilize sparingly as it prefers lean soils. Provide a cool, open location to ensure optimal growth and flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Alpine soils are typically lean and rocky. Use a balanced, diluted fertilizer sparingly, perhaps once or twice during the growing season, if the soil is particularly poor.
