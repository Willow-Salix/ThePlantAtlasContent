## Care Guide
This woodland native thrives in partial to full shade, requiring consistently moist yet well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Mimicking its temperate forest habitat, ensure regular watering and light fertilization for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. It naturally grows in soils rich in decaying organic matter, so amending with compost or a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer in spring is beneficial.
