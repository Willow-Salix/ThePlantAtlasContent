## Care Guide
This plant, native to tropical and subtropical South American grasslands and savannas, thrives in full sun exposure. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and benefits from light fertilization during its active growth period. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot, as it is adapted to dry spells.

### Fertilizer
Light; a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer). As a plant often found in less fertile soils, it does not require heavy fertilization.
