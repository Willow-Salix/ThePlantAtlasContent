## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South-eastern Australia (Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia) |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Mallee Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed woodlands. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering once established; highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. More frequent watering may be needed during initial establishment. |

## Introduction
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## Care Guide
This resilient Australian native thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established. It is adapted to lean, low-nutrient soils, so fertilize sparingly, ensuring any product used is low in phosphorus.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Native soils are often poor, and many eucalypts are sensitive to high phosphorus levels. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer very sparingly, if at all.
