## 🧤 Care Instructions
This corticolous lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its native humid subtropical forest habitat. Provide high, consistent humidity and dappled to indirect light. It obtains moisture from the air and benefits from frequent misting, but absolutely no traditional fertilizer should be used.
