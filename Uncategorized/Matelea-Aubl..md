# Milkvine

*Matelea Aubl.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | The Americas, ranging from the Southern United States, through Mexico, Central America, and into South America (e.g., Caribbean, Venezuela, Brazil). |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Forests and Woodlands. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to bright, indirect light. Avoid intense, direct afternoon sun, especially in hot climates, as it can scorch leaves, mimicking the dappled light of a forest understory. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged during the growing season, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Reduce frequency in cooler, dormant periods, reflecting regular rainfall patterns in their native habitats. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Milkvine thrives in warm, humid environments with partial shade to bright, indirect light, mimicking its native forest habitat. Maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, and provide regular, diluted fertilization during its active growth period to support its vining habit.

### Fertilizer
Benefit from a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Less frequent or no fertilization during fall and winter dormancy, as native soils are typically moderately fertile.
