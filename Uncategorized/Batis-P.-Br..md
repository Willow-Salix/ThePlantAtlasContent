# Turtleweed

*Batis P. Br.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions of the Americas (from Florida to Texas, Mexico, Central America, Caribbean, and South America down to Peru and Brazil), and some Pacific Islands. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Coastal Salt Marsh/Mangrove/Beach environments. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. Thrives in direct, intense sunlight, consistent with its exposure in open coastal areas. |
| **Watering** | High water needs, requiring consistently moist to wet soil and tolerating frequent inundation. For long-term health, it prefers brackish or saline water conditions, replicating its native salt-tolerant habitat. |

## Care Guide
Turtleweed thrives in full, direct sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil, ideally with brackish or saline water to mimic its native coastal habitat. It is a resilient plant adapted to warm, humid environments, needing only moderate, infrequent fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Moderate and infrequent. Native coastal sandy soils are not typically rich, so a balanced, dilute liquid fertilizer applied every few months during the growing season is generally sufficient.
