| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | High-altitude and northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe (e.g., British Isles, Scandinavia), Asia, and North America. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Subarctic, Montane Boreal, Cool Temperate Heathland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring brighter conditions in cooler climates; protect from intense midday sun, especially in warmer regions. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil; does not tolerate drought or waterlogging. Regular watering is crucial, especially during dry spells. |

## Introduction
Diphasiastrum alpinum, the alpine clubmoss, is a species of clubmoss. This plant is a glaucous scale-leaved perennial pteridophyte. In Finland, the spores are produced June to September. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his Flora Lapponica, 1737, from specimens obtained in Finland.

## Care Guide
This alpine clubmoss thrives in cool, consistently moist environments with excellent drainage. Provide bright, indirect light or morning sun, protecting it from intense heat and drought to mimic its high-altitude native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low; a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season (spring/early summer) is sufficient.
