# Snow Lichen
### *Rhizocarpon chionophilum Th. Fr.*

![Snow Lichen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Rhizocarpon_geographicum01.jpg)

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Alpine regions globally, including Scandinavia, the Alps, Rocky Mountains, and Himalayas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra, specifically thriving in snowbed communities where snow persists for a long duration. |
| **☀️ Light** | High light exposure (full sun) when not snow-covered, but crucially requires very cold temperatures and protection from intense heat. It is adapted to high UV radiation found in alpine environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies on consistent moisture from snowmelt, precipitation, or fog, particularly when metabolically active. Tolerant of periods of desiccation but requires hydration for growth. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rhizocarpon is a genus of crustose, saxicolous (or sometimes lichenicolous), lecideoid lichens in the family Rhizocarpaceae. The genus is common in arctic-alpine environments, but also occurs throughout temperate, subtropical, and even tropical regions. They are commonly known as map lichens because of the prothallus forming border-like bands between colonies in some species, like the common map lichen (Rhizocarpon geographicum).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cold-adapted lichen thrives in specific alpine and arctic environments with consistent exposure to snowmelt and very cold temperatures. It requires a rocky substrate and does not need soil, fertilizer, or traditional watering, instead relying on atmospheric moisture and its environment for sustenance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers. It obtains all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition, precipitation, and the mineral substrate it grows upon.
