## Care Guide
This Astragalus species thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions, mimicking its native temperate steppe and subalpine habitats. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and use fertilizer very lightly or not at all due to its adaptation to lean soils. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soils. Avoid over-fertilizing, especially nitrogen.
