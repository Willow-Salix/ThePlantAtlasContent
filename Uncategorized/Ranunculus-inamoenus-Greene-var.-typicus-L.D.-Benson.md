## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically the Rocky Mountains and Intermountain West of the USA and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Montane to Subalpine Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers open areas with bright light. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil, especially during the growing season. Native to wet meadows and stream banks, so it does not tolerate drying out. |

## Introduction
Ranunculus  is a large genus of about 1750 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Members of the genus are known as buttercups, spearworts and water crowfoots.
The genus is distributed worldwide, primarily in temperate and montane regions. The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, which has extremely tough and tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much taller meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris. In ornamental  gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.
Buttercups usually flower in the spring, but flowers may be found throughout the summer, especially where the plants are growing as opportunistic colonizers, as in the case of garden weeds.
The water crowfoots (Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium), which grow in still or running water, are sometimes treated in a separate genus Batrachium (from Greek βάτραχος bátrakhos, "frog"). They have two different leaf types, thread-like leaves underwater and broader floating leaves. In some species, such as R. aquatilis, a third, intermediate leaf type occurs.
Ranunculus species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Hebrew character and small angle shades. Some species are popular ornamental flowers in horticulture, with many cultivars selected for large and brightly coloured flowers.

## Care Guide
To mimic its montane meadow habitat, provide this plant with full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular watering is crucial, especially during its growing period, and light fertilization can support vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the active growing season. Benefits from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer, particularly in less fertile soils.
