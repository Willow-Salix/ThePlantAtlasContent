## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect light to partial sun, typical of an understory or climbing vine in a rainforest. Can tolerate more sun if acclimated and provided with ample water and humidity, but should be protected from intense midday direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking the frequent rainfall of its native tropical rainforest. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging, and high ambient humidity is highly beneficial. |

## Introduction
Uvaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Annonaceae. The generic name Uvaria is derived from the Latin uva, 'grape', because the fruit of some species in the genus resemble grapes. Species are distributed throughout the Old World tropics.

## Care Guide
To care for the Ylang-ylang Vine, provide bright, indirect light and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, simulating its tropical rainforest origin. High humidity is crucial, and regular fertilization during the growing season will promote healthy growth and abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, organic-rich fertilizer to support vigorous growth and flowering in its nutrient-rich but constantly leached native soil.
