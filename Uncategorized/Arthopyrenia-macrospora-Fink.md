## 🌱 Overview
Arthopyrenia is a genus of fungi in the family Trypetheliaceae. It was formerly classified in the eponymic family Arthopyreniaceae, but molecular phylogenetics studies showed that the type species, Arthopyrenia cerasi, was a member of the Trypetheliaceae. Arthopyrenia fungi typically form inconspicuous films embedded within tree bark and produce tiny, flask-shaped fruiting bodies covered by dark, shield-like caps. The genus includes both lichen-forming species (those that partner with algae) and non-lichenized species, with about 100 currently recognized species found primarily on bark and wood substrates.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in humid environments with indirect light, typical of temperate deciduous forests. It requires consistent humidity and occasional wetting for moisture absorption, with good air circulation being vital to prevent moisture-related issues. Traditional fertilizers are not necessary as it obtains nutrients from its surroundings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization needed, as it obtains nutrients primarily from the air and its substrate.
