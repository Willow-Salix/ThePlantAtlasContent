## Care Guide
Campylium moss thrives in consistently moist, humid environments with bright indirect light or partial shade. Ensure the substrate never dries out, providing frequent watering or maintaining high humidity. Fertilizer is rarely needed due to their low nutrient requirements.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs; excessive fertilization can be harmful. If necessary, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly.
