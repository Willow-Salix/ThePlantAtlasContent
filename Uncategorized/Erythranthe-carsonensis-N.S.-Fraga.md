## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Carson Valley, spanning western Nevada and eastern California, USA |
| **Climate** | Wetland/Riparian |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers some afternoon shade in regions with intense summer heat to reduce water stress. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to very moist soil, simulating its native habitat along stream banks and seeps. Never allow the soil to dry out. |

## Introduction
Erythranthe, the monkey-flowers and musk-flowers, is a diverse plant genus with more than 120 members (as of 2022) in the family Phrymaceae. Erythranthe was originally described as a separate genus, then generally regarded as a section within the genus Mimulus, and recently returned to generic rank. Mimulus sect. Diplacus was segregated from Mimulus as a separate genus at the same time. Mimulus remains as a small genus of eastern North America and the Southern Hemisphere. Molecular data show Erythranthe and Diplacus to be distinct evolutionary lines that are distinct from Mimulus as strictly defined, although this nomenclature is controversial.
Member species are usually annuals or herbaceous perennials. Flowers are red, pink, or yellow, often in various combinations. A large number of the Erythranthe species grow in moist to wet soils with some growing even in shallow water. They are not very drought resistant, but many of the species now classified as Diplacus are. Species are found at elevations from oceanside to high mountains as well as a wide variety of climates, though most prefer wet areas such as riverbanks.
The largest concentration of species is in western North America, but species are found elsewhere in the United States and Canada, as well as from Mexico to Chile and eastern Asia.  Pollination is mostly by either bees or hummingbirds. Member species are widely cultivated and are subject to several pests and diseases.  Several species are listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in perpetually wet conditions, mimicking its native stream bank habitat within a semi-arid region. It prefers full sun to partial shade, with afternoon shade beneficial in hot climates. Provide moderate, balanced fertilization during its active growth to support its robust moisture needs.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season is sufficient. Native soils are often mineral-rich but not excessively fertile.
