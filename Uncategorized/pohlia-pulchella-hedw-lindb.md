## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in cool, consistently moist environments with low to moderate indirect light. Ensure high humidity and a perpetually damp (but not soggy) substrate. Fertilizer requirements are minimal, reflecting its natural habitat on nutrient-poor surfaces.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs; use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly, if at all.
