## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun, Wyoming Rockcress needs well-drained soil and moderate watering during its active growth, mimicking its native rocky, high-altitude habitat. It requires minimal to no fertilization, as it is adapted to lean soil conditions. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.
