## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar and mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America (Greenland, Canada, USA), Europe (Scandinavia, Alps), and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, and exposed rocky areas within Boreal Forests. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, direct light to partial shade, mimicking its natural exposure on rocks in high-altitude and high-latitude environments. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity and consistent atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, fog, snowmelt). Tolerates periods of desiccation, but thrives with regular wetting cycles. |

## Introduction
Rhizocarpon is a genus of crustose, saxicolous (or sometimes lichenicolous), lecideoid lichens in the family Rhizocarpaceae. The genus is common in arctic-alpine environments, but also occurs throughout temperate, subtropical, and even tropical regions. They are commonly known as map lichens because of the prothallus forming border-like bands between colonies in some species, like the common map lichen (Rhizocarpon geographicum).

## Care Guide
Rhizocarpon ambiguum is an alpine and arctic lichen that thrives in cool temperatures, high humidity, and bright, exposed conditions on a rock substrate. It requires no traditional watering or fertilization, relying solely on atmospheric moisture and airborne nutrients for survival and growth.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required, as lichens absorb nutrients directly from the air, precipitation, and the mineral substrate (rocks) they grow on.
