## Care Guide
This resilient vine thrives in bright light and prefers its soil to dry out between waterings, reflecting its native semi-arid savanna habitat. Provide moderate humidity and feed sparingly during the active growing season. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Feed sparingly with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength, once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer). No fertilizer needed in fall and winter.
