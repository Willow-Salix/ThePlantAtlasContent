## Introduction
Lesquerella is the former name of a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Recent work has shown that Lesquerella is indistinct from the genus Physaria and both genera have been united under Physaria. In addition, the former Lesquerella of the southeastern United States have been moved to the genus Paysonia since 2002. The genus Lesquerella is now no longer applied to any species and is considered defunct.
The genus is named in honor of Leo Lesquereux, 1805–1889, Swiss and American botanist.

## Care Guide
This arid scrubland native thrives in full sun and very well-draining, poor soils. It is extremely drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. Emulate its high desert environment for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Native to lean, rocky, and clay soils, it does not require rich nutrients. If desired, use a very diluted, balanced fertilizer sparingly.
