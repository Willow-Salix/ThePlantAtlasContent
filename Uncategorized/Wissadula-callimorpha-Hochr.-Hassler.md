## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Paraguay, Argentina |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Dry Forest and Savanna/Grassland (often found in disturbed, open areas) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in environments with good light exposure, typical of forest edges, clearings, or disturbed sites where it can receive direct sunlight for several hours a day. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. Water more frequently during active growth periods (mimicking wet seasons) and reduce during cooler or drier periods. Avoid consistently soggy soil. |

## Introduction
Wissadula is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It contains 
38 species of herbs and subshrubs that are mostly native to the Neotropics, with several in tropical Asia and Africa.  The name is derived from the Sinhala language.

## Care Guide
This plant prefers bright light conditions, mirroring its native habitat in open, disturbed subtropical regions. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and benefits from occasional feeding during its main growing season.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer can be applied monthly or bi-monthly during the active growing season. Plants in pioneer or disturbed areas often tolerate average to somewhat poor soils, so heavy fertilization is not necessary.
