## 🌱 Overview
Tripterocalyx is a small genus of flowering plants in the four o'clock family, Nyctaginaceae. It contains four species formerly included in the closely related genus Abronia, the sand-verbenas. These plants are native to North America, especially the dry desert southwest of the United States. They bloom in heads of several colorful trumpet-shaped flowers. Sandpuffs or sand-verbenas are common names for plants in this genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sandpuffs thrive in conditions mimicking their native arid scrublands, requiring abundant direct sunlight and very infrequent watering. Allow the soil to dry out completely between applications. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, as they are adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. If used, apply a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly during the growing season.
