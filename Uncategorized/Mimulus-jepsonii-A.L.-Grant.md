| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (primarily Sacramento Valley and adjacent foothills) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean with seasonal wetlands (vernal pools) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, thriving in open and exposed areas. |
| **Watering** | High water needs during its active growing season (winter and spring), requiring consistently moist to wet conditions. Must experience a dry period during summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
Mimulus jepsonii requires conditions that mimic its native vernal pool habitat, including full sun and consistently wet soil during its active growth in winter and spring. It is crucial to allow the plant to experience a dry period during its summer dormancy, and fertilization should be minimal due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. It is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of vernal pools; excessive fertilizer can be detrimental.
