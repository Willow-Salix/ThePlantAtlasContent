# Oval Ladies' Tresses
### *Ibidium ovale (Lindl.) House*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America, spanning from the Great Lakes region south to Florida and west to Texas and Oklahoma. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Woodland, characterized by distinct seasons, moist summers, and often humid conditions. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to dappled sunlight, replicating its native understory environment in woodlands. Protect from intense, direct afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil during the active growing season, but not waterlogged. Reduce watering significantly during its winter dormancy period. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate orchid requires partial shade and consistently moist soil, especially during its growing season, to emulate its woodland origins. Provide light fertilization and ensure a period of winter dormancy. Avoid both drying out and waterlogging the roots.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light, balanced fertilization during the growing season, mimicking the nutrient-rich, decaying organic matter found in woodland soils. Avoid heavy feeding.
