## Introduction
Cerastium is a genus of annual, winter annual, or perennial flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. They are commonly called mouse-ears or mouse-ear chickweeds. There are 214 accepted species, found nearly worldwide but with the greatest concentration in the northern temperate regions. A number of the species are common weeds in fields and on disturbed ground.

Cerastium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora chalcogrammella (which feeds exclusively on Cerastium arvense) and Coleophora striatipennella (which has been recorded on Cerastium fontanum).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in temperate conditions, requiring consistently moist soil and adapting well to both full sun and partial shade. It is not a heavy feeder, flourishing in average to moderately fertile soil with basic care.

### Fertilizer
Tolerates average to moderately rich soils, typical of pioneer species in disturbed habitats. Benefits from general-purpose fertilizer sparingly if growth is poor.
