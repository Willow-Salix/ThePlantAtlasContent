## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions of North America, specifically Alaska, Yukon, and Northwest Territories. |
| **Climate** | Alpine/Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, ideally 6+ hours of direct sunlight per day, mimicking the open, exposed conditions of its native tundra habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires excellent drainage and is highly susceptible to root rot from overwatering. |

## Introduction
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## Care Guide
This tundra plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean to rocky soil, requiring cold-hardy conditions. Water moderately during its short growing season, letting the soil dry out, and avoid over-fertilization to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Native to lean, nutrient-poor soils. If necessary, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year in spring.
