## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright, cool conditions with well-draining, rocky soil, mirroring its high-altitude native habitat. Provide full sun to partial shade and allow soil to dry between moderate waterings. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer; it thrives in lean, rocky soils and generally does not require heavy feeding. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if desired.
