## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and subarctic regions; high mountains of the Northern Hemisphere including North America (Alaska, Canada, Greenland), Europe (Scandinavia, Iceland, Alps, Pyrenees), and Asia (Russia). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright, direct light for several hours a day, typical of exposed alpine environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot; reduce watering significantly in winter or during dormancy. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga cespitosa, the tufted alpine saxifrage or tufted saxifrage, is a species of flowering plant common to many arctic heights. It appears further south in mountainous areas of the Alps, Norway, Scotland, Wales, Iceland, Siberia, western North America and Greenland.
Densely tufted from a stout taproot, the plant has very short stems with withered, dead leaves at the base. The leaves have three to five lobes; both leaves and calyx exhibit trichomes in the form of glandular hair. Flowering stems range from 5–10 cm, with one or two flowers per stem. Its petals are white, twice the length of the calyx lobes. Smaller specimens, with shorter stems and smaller, yellowish-greenish petals (with uniflorous variants), are rather frequent.
The tufted saxifrage grows on ledges and gravelly places.
It became a protected species in the UK in 1975 under the Conservation of Wild Creatures and Wild Plants Act.

## Care Guide
Tufted Saxifrage is an arctic-alpine plant adapted to cold, exposed, well-drained conditions. Provide full to partial sun and moderate, consistent moisture during its growing period, ensuring superb drainage to prevent waterlogging. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it prefers lean, rocky substrates.

### Fertilizer
Low. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very diluted balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season. It thrives in lean, rocky soils.
