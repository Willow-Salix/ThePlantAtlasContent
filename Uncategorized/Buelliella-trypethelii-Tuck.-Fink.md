## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, particularly the southeastern United States. |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade, mimicking the filtered light conditions found on tree bark within a forest understory. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and frequent atmospheric moisture (e.g., rain, fog, dew), as lichens absorb water directly from their environment rather than through roots. |

## Introduction
Buelliella is a genus of lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) fungi in the family Stictographaceae. It comprises 13 thirteen species. The genus was established in 1935 by the American lichenologist Bruce Fink, who originally included seven species. These fungi are parasites that live on other lichens, producing small disc-shaped fruiting bodies that start buried in their host and later emerge at the surface.

## Care Guide
This lichenicolous fungus thrives in a consistently humid environment with bright, indirect light, mirroring its natural habitat on host lichens within humid subtropical forests. It requires no traditional watering or fertilization, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and nutrients from its host.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is needed; lichens and lichenicolous fungi obtain necessary nutrients from the atmosphere, rainfall, and their host, lacking mechanisms for soil nutrient uptake.
