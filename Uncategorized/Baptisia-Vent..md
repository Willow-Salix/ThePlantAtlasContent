## Introduction
Baptisia (wild indigo, false indigo) is a genus in the legume family, Fabaceae. They are flowering herbaceous perennial plants with pea-like flowers, followed by pods, which are sometimes inflated. They are native to woodland and grassland in eastern and southern North America. The species most commonly found in cultivation is B. australis.
Baptisia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the jaguar flower moth, Schinia jaguarina.

## Care Guide
Wild Indigo thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil typical of temperate grasslands. Establish with regular watering, then enjoy its drought tolerance and minimal need for fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. It is a low-maintenance plant once mature.

### Fertilizer
As a member of the Fabaceae family, Baptisia fixes nitrogen into the soil and generally requires little to no supplemental fertilization. It can tolerate average to poor soils.
