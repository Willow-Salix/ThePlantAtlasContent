## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light; prefers shaded or partially shaded locations, mimicking its growth on tree bark or rocks under canopy cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high humidity and occasional moisture from misting or natural rainfall; sensitive to desiccation but also to prolonged saturation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ochrolechia is the sole genus in the fungal family Ochrolechiaceae. It comprises about 40 species of crustose lichens. These lichens typically form uneven, often thick, crust-like growths on various surfaces and are characterised by their white to pale grey thalli, which may have a greenish tint. The genus has a long evolutionary history, with fossils dating back to the Paleogene period, about 34 million years ago. Ochrolechia species have disc-like apothecia (fruiting bodies), which are usually yellowish or brownish-pink and often covered with a fine white powdery coating. The genus is widely distributed and includes both common and rare species, with some found in extreme environments such as arctic and alpine regions. Ochrolechia lichens produce diverse secondary metabolites, including orcinol depsides, depsidones, and xanthones.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ochrolechia gonatodes thrives in conditions of low to indirect light and consistently high humidity, mirroring its natural forest habitat. Ensure good air circulation and provide occasional moisture through misting, but never fertilize, as lichens are highly susceptible to nutrient enrichment and pollutants.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; lichens obtain nutrients from the air and rainwater, and are highly sensitive to pollutants and excess nutrients.
