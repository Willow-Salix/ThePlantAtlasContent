## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cantelow's Lewisia requires a position in full sun to partial shade with exceptionally well-drained, lean soil, mimicking its native rocky alpine habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid overwatering, particularly in winter, to prevent rot. Fertilization is generally unnecessary due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky soils.
