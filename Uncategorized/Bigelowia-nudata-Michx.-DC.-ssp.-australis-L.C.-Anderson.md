## Care Guide
This plant thrives in sunny locations with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native pine flatwoods and savanna habitats. It prefers low to moderate fertilizer input, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-limited conditions in the Southeastern U.S. Provide regular watering, especially during dry periods, to support its moisture-loving nature.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy or acidic soils. Excessive fertilization is not typically needed.
