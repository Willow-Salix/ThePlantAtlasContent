# Western Parmelia Lichen

*Parmelia occidentalis Essl.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountain regions. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Forest or Subalpine Forest. Characterized by moderate temperatures, distinct seasons, regular precipitation (rain and snow), and often high atmospheric humidity. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to moderate sun exposure. As an epiphytic or saxicolous lichen, it typically grows on tree bark or rocks, often under the forest canopy or in open but not scorching conditions. Requires clean air and is sensitive to prolonged direct, harsh sun which can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Relies entirely on atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, fog) and high humidity. It has no roots for water uptake. Requires frequent wetting and drying cycles, but consistent access to humidity is crucial for long-term health. Not suitable for traditional watering regimes. |

## Introduction

Parmelia (barque), the vessel that in 1829 transported the first settlers of the British colony of Western Australia

## Care Guide
This lichen is extremely difficult to cultivate outside its natural environment. It thrives in temperate montane forests with clean air, high humidity, and regular atmospheric moisture, typically growing on bark or rock. Traditional plant care, including watering and fertilizing, is detrimental; its survival depends entirely on specific environmental conditions rather than cultivation practices.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers. Obtains trace nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rainfall) and leachates from its substrate. Highly sensitive to nutrient pollution, especially nitrogen and phosphorus compounds found in agricultural or urban runoff/air pollution.
