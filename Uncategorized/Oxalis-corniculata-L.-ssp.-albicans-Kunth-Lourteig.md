| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States, Mexico, Central America, and Andean regions of South America (e.g., Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Montane Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers bright indirect light or morning sun in very hot climates, tolerating direct sun in cooler conditions. |

## Introduction
Oxalis corniculata, the creeping woodsorrel, procumbent yellow sorrel or sleeping beauty, is a somewhat delicate-appearing, low-growing herbaceous plant in the family Oxalidaceae.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright, open conditions and prefers well-draining soil that is allowed to dry out between waterings. It is not a heavy feeder and adapts well to varying conditions, making it relatively low maintenance. Protect from prolonged periods of extreme heat and drought.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder; a diluted balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the active growing season is sufficient, or less if growing vigorously.
