## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico and Southwest United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) |
| **Climate** | Montane Temperate (riparian zones, wet meadows) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, especially appreciating some afternoon shade in hotter climates or regions with intense sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking its native wet meadow and stream bank habitats. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely, but also ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Ranunculus  is a large genus of about 1750 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Members of the genus are known as buttercups, spearworts and water crowfoots.
The genus is distributed worldwide, primarily in temperate and montane regions. The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, which has extremely tough and tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much taller meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris. In ornamental  gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.
Buttercups usually flower in the spring, but flowers may be found throughout the summer, especially where the plants are growing as opportunistic colonizers, as in the case of garden weeds.
The water crowfoots (Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium), which grow in still or running water, are sometimes treated in a separate genus Batrachium (from Greek βάτραχος bátrakhos, "frog"). They have two different leaf types, thread-like leaves underwater and broader floating leaves. In some species, such as R. aquatilis, a third, intermediate leaf type occurs.
Ranunculus species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Hebrew character and small angle shades. Some species are popular ornamental flowers in horticulture, with many cultivars selected for large and brightly coloured flowers.

## Care Guide
This buttercup thrives in conditions mimicking its native montane, moist meadow habitats. Provide it with full to partial sun, consistently moist (but not waterlogged) soil, and moderate fertility. It is well-suited for riparian plantings or boggy garden areas where consistent moisture is available.

### Fertilizer
Prefers moderately rich soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or organic compost in early spring should suffice, as it's not a heavy feeder.
