## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Neotropics (Mexico, Central America, Caribbean, and northern South America, extending south to Brazil and Peru) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest (epiphytic or lithophytic in humid, shaded forests) |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light; avoid direct sunlight which can scorch its delicate fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the potting medium consistently moist but never waterlogged. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. High humidity is crucial, so regular misting or placement near a humidifier is beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Asplenium is a genus of about 700 species of ferns, often treated as the only genus in the family Aspleniaceae, though other authors consider Hymenasplenium separate, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, a different chromosome count, and structural differences in the rhizomes. The type species for the genus is Asplenium marinum.
The most common vernacular name is spleenworts, applied to the more "typical" species. A. nidus and several similar species are called bird's-nest ferns, the Camptosorus group is known as walking ferns, and distinct names are applied to some other particularly well-known species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical fern thrives in conditions mimicking its native rainforest understory: high humidity, consistent moisture, and low to medium indirect light. Protect it from direct sun and provide regular, light feeding during active growth to encourage lush foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient, using a diluted liquid fern fertilizer or balanced houseplant fertilizer once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer).
