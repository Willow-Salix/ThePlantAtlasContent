## 🌱 Overview
Physostegia, the lionshearts or false dragonheads  (in reference to their similarity to Dracocephalum), is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae, native to North America (United States, Canada, northern Mexico). They are erect rhizomatous herbaceous perennials inhabiting damp, sunny places. 
They grow up to 2 m (7 ft) tall with purple or pink tubular flowers in racemes in summer.
The generic name comes from two Greek words, physa (a bladder) and stege (a covering), referring to the calyx, which becomes full of fruit when mature.
Physostegia virginiana is the most common species, and is known as "obedient plant".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in its native humid subtropical climate, preferring consistently moist to wet soil found in floodplains and wet woodlands. It performs best in full sun to partial shade, especially when adequate moisture is provided, and benefits from a soil rich in organic matter without needing heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate, thrives in soils rich in organic matter. Avoid excessive fertilization, which can promote leggy growth.
