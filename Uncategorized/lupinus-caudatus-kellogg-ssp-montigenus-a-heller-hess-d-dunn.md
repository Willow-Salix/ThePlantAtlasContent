## 🧤 Care Instructions
Kellogg's spurred lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native habitat on dry, open mountain slopes of Western North America. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it a low-maintenance plant suited for arid or semi-arid garden conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; generally no fertilizer needed due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. If growth is exceptionally poor, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
