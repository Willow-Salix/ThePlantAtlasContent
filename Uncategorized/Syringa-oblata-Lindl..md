## Introduction
Syringa is a genus of 12 currently recognized species of flowering woody plants in the olive family or Oleaceae called lilacs. These lilacs are native to woodland and scrub from southeastern Europe to eastern Asia, and widely and commonly cultivated in temperate areas elsewhere.
The genus is most closely related to Ligustrum (privet), classified with it in Oleaceae tribus Oleeae subtribus Ligustrinae.
Lilacs are used as food plants by the larvae of some moth species, including lilac leaf mining moth, privet hawk moth, copper underwing, scalloped oak and Svensson's copper underwing.

## Care Guide
The Early Lilac thrives in temperate conditions with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. It needs consistent moisture but is not a heavy feeder, requiring minimal fertilization to produce its characteristic early blooms.

### Fertilizer
Generally a light feeder. Fertilize sparingly in early spring with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer if soil is poor or flowering is suboptimal; avoid over-fertilizing.
