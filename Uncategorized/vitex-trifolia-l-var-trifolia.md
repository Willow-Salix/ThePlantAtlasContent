## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide this resilient plant with ample sunlight and consistent, but not waterlogged, moisture, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings to emulate its native coastal monsoon conditions. It thrives in warm temperatures and tolerates various soil types, requiring only light fertilization during its growth phase.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate balanced fertilizer during the active growing season; it is adaptable to the often nutrient-poor sandy or disturbed soils of its native habitat and is not a heavy feeder.
