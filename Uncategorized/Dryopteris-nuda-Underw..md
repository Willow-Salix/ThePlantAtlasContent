## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Appalachian region, Gulf Coastal Plain, and lower Mississippi Valley) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade. Dappled sunlight or morning sun is ideal, protecting it from harsh afternoon direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged. While more tolerant of dry conditions than many ferns, ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
The moth genus Dryopteris is now considered a junior synonym of Oreta.

Dryopteris , commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to Dryopteris filix-mas), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales.
Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American Dryopteris hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization.
The fossil record of this genus shows that it was widespread even as far back as the Cretaceous with fossils being found in Late Cretaceous rock layers from North America down to Antarctica.

## Care Guide
The Dry Land Woodfern thrives in the dappled light of a temperate deciduous forest, requiring partial to full shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Though resilient to some dryness, regular watering is key, complemented by a light, infrequent feeding during its growing period for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding. Apply a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer). Excessive fertilization can harm the plant.
