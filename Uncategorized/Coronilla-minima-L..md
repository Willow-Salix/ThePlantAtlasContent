## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern and Central Europe, North Africa, Western Asia |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean climate, characterized by warm to hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, often in dry grasslands, garrigue, and stony areas. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily). Tolerates some partial shade but performs best with ample light exposure, reflecting its open habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid constant moisture or waterlogging, especially during warmer months. |

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, even poor, soils, reflecting its Mediterranean origins. Provide infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid over-fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and generally requires little to no supplemental fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
