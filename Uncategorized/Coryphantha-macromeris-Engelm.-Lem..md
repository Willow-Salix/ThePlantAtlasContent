## Introduction
Coryphantha (from Greek, "flowering on the top"), or beehive cactus, is a genus of small to middle-sized, globose or columnar cacti. The genus is native to arid parts of Central America, Mexico, through Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas and north into southwestern, central, and southeastern Montana. With its two subgenera, 57 species and 20 subspecies, it is one of the largest genera of cactus.

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in abundant sunlight and extremely well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Allow the soil to dry completely between waterings and fertilize sparingly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Apply a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus/succulent fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
