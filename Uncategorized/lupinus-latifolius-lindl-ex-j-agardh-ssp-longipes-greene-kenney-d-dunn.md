## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest (e.g., Oregon, Washington) extending into California, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and British Columbia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight) for optimal growth and flowering, but can tolerate light partial shade, especially in hotter climates or during the afternoon. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, particularly during its active growth period and bloom, mimicking conditions from spring snowmelt and summer rains. Tolerates some drought once established, but avoid prolonged dry periods and waterlogging. Water deeply when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Broadleaf Lupine thrives in temperate montane conditions, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil to emulate its native habitat. As a nitrogen-fixer, it has low fertilizer needs, making a low-nitrogen feeding optional. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and generally does not require high nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer or compost can be applied sparingly in early spring if soil appears very poor, but it often thrives without supplemental feeding.
