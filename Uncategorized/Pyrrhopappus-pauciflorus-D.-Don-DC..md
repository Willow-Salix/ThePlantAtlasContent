## Care Guide
Smallflower Desert-Chicory thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its arid native habitat. It requires minimal watering once established and tolerates poor soil, making it an excellent, low-maintenance choice for xeriscaping or dry garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; native soils are often nutrient-poor. A light, balanced fertilizer application once a year in spring, or none at all if grown in suitable soil conditions, is sufficient.
