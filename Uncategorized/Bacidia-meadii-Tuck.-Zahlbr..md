## Introduction
Bacidia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. These lichens are characterised by their crustose growth form, distinctive club-shaped reproductive structures called apothecia that contain long, needle-like spores, and their symbiotic partnership with green algae. Bacidia species typically grow on various substrates including tree bark, rock surfaces, and occasionally soil, and are distinguished from related genera by their specific spore characteristics and internal structures.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in humid environments with filtered light, mimicking its native temperate forest habitat. It obtains nutrients from the air and its substrate, not requiring traditional fertilization. Ensure consistent ambient moisture for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required; derives nutrients from air and its tree bark substrate
