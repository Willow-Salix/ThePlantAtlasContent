## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | British Virgin Islands (endemic to Anegada) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest / Coastal Scrubland (on porous limestone) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; requires high light intensity. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings; tolerant of dry periods mimicking its native habitat's rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Cynanchum is a genus of about 300 species including some swallowworts, belonging to the family Apocynaceae. The taxon name comes from Greek kynos (meaning "dog") and anchein ("to choke"), hence the common name for several species is dog-strangling vine. Most species are non-succulent climbers or twiners. There is some evidence of toxicity.

## Care Guide
This Caribbean native thrives in conditions mimicking its sunny, well-drained, and somewhat arid island home. Provide abundant sunlight and allow the soil to fully dry between moderate waterings to prevent root issues. Fertilize sparingly during active growth to support its development without over-enriching.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula during the active growing season (spring/summer); adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils.
