## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in pine flatwoods, savannas, and open woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimic its native environment with regular rainfall, but avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Helianthus () is a genus comprising around 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the daisy family Asteraceae commonly known as sunflowers. Except for three South American species, the species of Helianthus are native to North America and Central America. The best-known species is the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus). This and other species, notably Jerusalem artichoke (H. tuberosus), are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions, as food crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants. The species H. annuus typically grows during the summer and into early fall, with the peak growth season being mid-summer.
Several perennial Helianthus species are grown in gardens, but have a tendency to spread rapidly and can become aggressive.  On the other hand, the whorled sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus, was listed as an endangered species in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule protecting it under the Endangered Species Act. The primary threats to this species are industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. They grow to 1.8 metres (6 feet) and are primarily found in woodlands, adjacent to creeks and moist, prairie-like areas.
The common sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine, cultivated there for several centuries.

## Care Guide
The Narrowleaf Sunflower thrives in full sun and well-drained, consistently moist soil, mirroring its native open woodlands and savannas in the humid subtropical southeastern U.S. It requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to less fertile soils typical of pine flatwoods. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient.
