## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico, Central America, and northern South America (including Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest / Tropical Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers bright light and can tolerate direct sunlight for several hours daily. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the active growing season (wet season), allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Significantly reduce watering during cooler or dormant periods (dry season) to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Jatropha is a genus of flowering plants in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. The name is derived from the Greek words ἰατρός (iatros), meaning "physician", and τροφή (trophe), meaning "nutrition", hence the common name physic nut. Another common name is nettlespurge. It contains approximately 180 species of succulent plants, shrubs and trees (some are deciduous, like Jatropha curcas). Most of these are native to the Americas, with 66 species found in the Old World. Plants produce separate male and female flowers. As with many members of the family Euphorbiaceae, Jatropha contains compounds that are highly toxic. Jatropha species have traditionally been used in basketmaking, tanning and dye production. In the 2000s, one species, Jatropha curcas, generated interest as an oil crop for biodiesel production and also medicinal importance when used as lamp oil; native Mexicans in the Veracruz area developed by selective breeding a Jatropha curcas variant lacking the toxic compounds, yielding a better income when used as source for biodiesel, because of its edible byproduct. Toxicity may return if edible Jatropha is pollinated by toxic types.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in warm, brightly lit conditions, consistent with its native tropical dry forest and savanna habitats. Provide full to partial sun exposure and ensure a distinct wet-dry cycle for watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. Fertilize moderately during periods of active growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer, applied every 2-4 weeks.
