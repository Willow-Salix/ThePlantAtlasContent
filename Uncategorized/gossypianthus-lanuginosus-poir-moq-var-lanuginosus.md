# Woolly Cottonflower
### *Gossypianthus lanuginosus (Poir.) Moq. var. lanuginosus*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida), Caribbean (Bahamas, Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Lesser Antilles) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Dry Shrubland/Coastal Scrub |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in bright, direct light for most of the day, reflecting its open habitat in pinelands and disturbed sites. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, preferring well-draining conditions similar to its native sandy soils. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, well-draining conditions typical of its native tropical dry shrubland and coastal scrub habitats. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between sessions, and fertilize sparingly. Ensure ample light for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal. Light fertilization during the growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer is sufficient, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils.
