## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including parts of California, Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, and Washington |
| **Climate** | Temperate Arid/Semi-Arid Rocky Slopes and Crevices |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Protect from intense direct afternoon sun, especially in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water infrequently, as overwatering can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Cheilanthes, commonly known as lip ferns, is a genus of about 180 species of rock-dwelling ferns with a cosmopolitan distribution in warm, dry, rocky regions, often growing in small crevices high up on cliffs.  Most are small, sturdy and evergreen.   The leaves, often densely covered in trichomes, spring directly from the rootstocks.  Many of them are desert ferns, curling up during dry times and reviving with the coming of moisture.  At the ends of veins sporangia, or spore-bearing structures, are protected by leaf margins, which curl over them.

## Care Guide
This resilient fern thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid rocky environments. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and ensure excellent drainage to prevent moisture retention. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, as it is highly drought-tolerant.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once a year during the growing season.
