## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Coastal Plain from New Jersey south to Florida and west to Louisiana) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (found in pine barrens, open woodlands, savannas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, ideally receiving at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, mimicking its open habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering is suitable; allow the topsoil to dry out slightly between waterings. While it tolerates some drought once established, it prefers consistently moist, well-drained conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lespedeza is a genus of some 45 species (including nothospecies) of flowering plants in the pea family (Fabaceae), commonly known as bush clovers or (particularly East Asian species) Japanese clovers (hagi). The genus is native to warm temperate to subtropical regions of eastern North America, eastern and southern Asia and Australasia.
These shrubby plants or trailing vines belong to the "typical" legumes (Faboideae), with the peas and beans, though they are part of another tribe, the Desmodieae. Therein, they are treated as type genus of the smaller subtribe Lespedezinae, which unites the present genus and its presumed closest relatives, Campylotropis and Kummerowia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Narrowleaf Lespedeza prefers full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its native pine barren and savanna environments. Provide moderate watering, allowing soil to dry between sessions, and avoid heavy fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes its own nitrogen and thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils typical of its native range. Avoid high nitrogen fertilizers.
