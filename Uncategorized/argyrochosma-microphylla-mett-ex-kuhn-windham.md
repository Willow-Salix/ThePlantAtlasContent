## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, California) and Northern Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland and Desert; found in rocky crevices and slopes, often on limestone. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to full sun; can tolerate direct morning sun or filtered afternoon sun, but may scorch in intense, unfiltered afternoon sun in very hot climates. Mimic its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Prefers infrequent but thorough watering, mimicking desert rainfall patterns. Avoid waterlogging, which can lead to root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Argyrochosma is a genus of ferns known commonly as false cloak ferns. The genus is included in the Cheilanthoideae subfamily of the Pteridaceae.  Species now in this genus were previously treated as members of related genera Notholaena or Pellaea but were segregated into their own genus in 1987.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fern thrives in bright light and prefers its soil to dry out completely between waterings, reflecting its native arid environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal fertilization, making it a relatively low-maintenance option for dry, sunny spots. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. Growing in nutrient-poor rocky soils natively, it can be sensitive to excessive nutrients. If fertilized, use a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once or twice during the growing season.
