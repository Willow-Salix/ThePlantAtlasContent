## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, specifically the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Wetlands (bogs, fens, wet meadows) within deciduous forest biomes. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to partial shade; prefers bright indirect light with some direct morning sun, avoiding intense midday or afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil conditions are crucial; never allow the substrate to dry out, especially during the growing season, mimicking its native boggy habitat. |

## Introduction
The genus Platanthera belongs to the subfamily Orchidoideae of the family Orchidaceae, and comprises about 150 species of orchids. The members of this genus, known as the butterfly orchids or fringed orchids, were previously included in the genus Orchis, which is a close relative (along with the genus Habenaria). They are distributed throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are terrestrial and have tubercules. The genomes of Platanthera zijinensis and Platanthera guangdongensis have been sequenced as model species to study partial and full mycoheterotrophy.

## Care Guide
This rare orchid hybrid thrives in cool, consistently moist, and boggy conditions, mirroring its native wetland habitat. It requires partial sun to partial shade and continuous watering to keep the substrate wet, especially during its active growing period. Provide minimal fertilization to support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a highly diluted (e.g., 1/4 strength) balanced liquid orchid fertilizer once every 2-4 weeks during active growth, as native wetland soils are often nutrient-poor.
