## Introduction
Geranium is a genus of 422 species of annual, biennial, and perennial plants that are commonly known as geraniums or cranesbills. They are found throughout the temperate regions of the world and the mountains of the tropics, with the greatest diversity in the eastern part of the Mediterranean region.
The palmately cleft leaves are broadly circular in form. The flowers have five petals and are coloured white, pink, purple, or blue, often with distinctive veining. Geraniums will grow in any soil as long as it is not waterlogged. Propagation is by semiripe cuttings in summer, by seed, or by division in autumn or spring.
Geraniums are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, ghost moth, and mouse moth. At least several species of Geranium are gynodioecious. The species Geranium viscosissimum (sticky geranium) is considered to be protocarnivorous.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, moist, and well-ventilated conditions with good drainage, mimicking its native exposed coastal environment. Provide full sun to partial shade and consistent moisture without waterlogging, as it is not a heavy feeder.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Prefers average to slightly poor soils and generally requires minimal fertilization, perhaps a light annual feed.
