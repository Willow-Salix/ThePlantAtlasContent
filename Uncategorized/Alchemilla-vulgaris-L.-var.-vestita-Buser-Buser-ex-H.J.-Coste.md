| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of Europe (widespread in Central and Northern Europe) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Meadow/Woodland Edge |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers partial shade in hotter climates to prevent leaf scorch. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture. Requires regular watering, especially during dry spells, as it thrives in naturally moist environments like meadows and stream banks. |

## Introduction
Alchemilla is a genus of herbaceous perennial plants in the family Rosaceae, with the common name lady's mantle applied generically as well as specifically to Alchemilla mollis when referred to as a garden plant. The plant used as a herbal tea or for medicinal usage such as gynaecological disorders is Alchemilla xanthochlora or in Middle Europe the so-called common lady's mantle Alchemilla vulgaris. There are about 700 species, the majority native to cool temperate and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia, with a few species native to the mountains of Africa and the Americas.
Most species of Alchemilla are clump-forming or mounded perennials with basal leaves arising from woody rhizomes. Some species have leaves with lobes that radiate from a common point and others have divided leaves—both are typically fan-shaped with small teeth at the tips. The long-stalked, gray-green to green leaves are often covered with soft hairs, and show a high degree of water-resistance (see Lotus effect). Green to bright chartreuse flowers are small, have no petals and appear in clusters above the foliage in late spring and summer.

## Care Guide
Lady's Mantle thrives in cool, temperate climates, preferring full sun to partial shade, particularly needing shade from intense afternoon sun. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and regular watering to mimic its native habitat. Fertilization needs are low, with moderate feeding in spring being adequate.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It naturally grows in average to moderately fertile soil and does not require heavy feeding. A light application of balanced fertilizer or compost in spring is usually sufficient.
