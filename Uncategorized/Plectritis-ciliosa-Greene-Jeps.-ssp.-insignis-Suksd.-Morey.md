| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun in cooler coastal areas, with some afternoon shade beneficial in hotter inland regions. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering during its active growing season in spring, ensuring consistent moisture. Tolerates drier conditions as it matures and goes to seed in early summer, consistent with its annual life cycle in a Mediterranean climate. |

## Introduction
Valeriana is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae, members of which may be commonly known as valerians. It contains many species, including the garden valerian, Valeriana officinalis. Valeriana has centers of diversity in Eurasia and South America (especially in the Andes), and is represented by native species on all continents except Antarctica. 
Some species have been introduced to parts of the world outside their native range, including Valeriana rubra in the western United States and Valeriana macrosiphon in Western Australia.

## Care Guide
Longspur Seablush is an annual wildflower adapted to Mediterranean climates, requiring full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Provide consistent moisture during its spring growth period, allowing it to dry out as it completes its life cycle in early summer. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it prefers lean to average soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to somewhat poor soils, as found in its native chaparral and grassland habitats; excessive fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
