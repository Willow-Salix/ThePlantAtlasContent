## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
Elliott's Goldenrod requires consistently wet to very moist soil and thrives in full to partial sun, mimicking its native humid subtropical wetland habitats. It generally tolerates average to poor soils, thus requiring minimal fertilization. Ensure the soil never dries out to promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not a heavy feeder. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer may be beneficial in very poor soils, but often thrives without supplemental feeding.
