## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Worldwide distribution, common across temperate and subtropical regions. |
| **Climate** | Moist Temperate and Subtropical Forest Floors, and shaded rocky areas. |
| **Sunlight** | Low to indirect light, as it naturally grows in shaded or semi-shaded environments. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial; the substrate should remain damp but not waterlogged. High ambient humidity is also beneficial. |

## Introduction
Reboulia hemisphaerica, the hemisphaeric liverwort or small mushroom-headed liverwort, is the only species of liverwort in the genus Reboulia.
A possible second species Reboulia queenslandica (Stephani) M. Hicks was published in 1992, but it was later determined to be a polyploid cross between two varieties of R. hemisphaerica, so not a distinct species. Subsequent lists and publications do not recognize it as distinct.
Riccardin C is a phenolic cyclic bibenzyl secondary metabolite isolated from R. hemisphaerica, as is marchantinquinone.

## Care Guide
This liverwort requires consistent moisture and high humidity, mimicking its native shaded, damp habitats. Provide low to indirect light and avoid waterlogging, as it's sensitive to both drought and excessive nutrients. No significant fertilization is typically needed.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is required, as liverworts generally thrive in nutrient-poor conditions and are sensitive to excessive salts.
