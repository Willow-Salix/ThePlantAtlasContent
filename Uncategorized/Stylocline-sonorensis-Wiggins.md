## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sonoran neststraw requires conditions mimicking its desert origin: full, intense sun and extremely infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely. Fertilization is generally not necessary due to its adaptation to lean desert soils. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.
