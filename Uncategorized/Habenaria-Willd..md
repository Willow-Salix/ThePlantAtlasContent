## Care Guide
Bog Orchids necessitate consistently moist to wet conditions, high humidity, and bright indirect light to partial sun to replicate their natural wetland environments. They are light feeders, benefiting from a dilute fertilizer solution applied occasionally during active growth periods.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder; use a dilute, balanced orchid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/2 strength) sparingly during the growing season.
