## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central United States |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical to Humid Continental |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun to partial shade. Full sun encourages denser growth and more prolific flowering. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Lespedeza is a genus of some 45 species (including nothospecies) of flowering plants in the pea family (Fabaceae), commonly known as bush clovers or (particularly East Asian species) Japanese clovers (hagi). The genus is native to warm temperate to subtropical regions of eastern North America, eastern and southern Asia and Australasia.
These shrubby plants or trailing vines belong to the "typical" legumes (Faboideae), with the peas and beans, though they are part of another tribe, the Desmodieae. Therein, they are treated as type genus of the smaller subtribe Lespedezinae, which unites the present genus and its presumed closest relatives, Campylotropis and Kummerowia.

## Care Guide
Stueve's Bush Clover is a resilient, low-maintenance plant native to the Eastern US. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering. Its ability to fix nitrogen means it has very low fertilizer requirements, making it an excellent choice for easy-care landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally performs well without supplemental fertilization, especially in soils of average fertility.
