## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including the Pacific Northwest (USA and Canada), ranging from Alaska to California. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforest, Coastal Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect to moderate light; prefers dappled shade characteristic of forest canopies, avoiding intense direct sun which can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity is crucial; this lichen absorbs moisture directly from the air and rain. Requires frequent misting or a consistently humid environment; it does not have roots for soil absorption. |

## Introduction
Hypogymnia is a genus of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. They are commonly known as tube lichens, bone lichens, or pillow lichens. Most species lack rhizines (root-like attachment organs on the lower surface) that are otherwise common in members of the Parmeliaceae, and have swollen lobes that are usually hollow. Other common characteristics are relatively small spores and the presence of physodic acid and related lichen products. The lichens usually grow on the bark and wood of coniferous trees.
Hypogymnia was proposed by lichenologist William Nylander, first as a subgenus of Parmelia in 1881, and 15 years later as a distinct genus of two species, including the widespread and common type species, Hypogymnia physodes. It has since grown to about 90 recognized species. Hypogymnia has a centre of biodiversity in China, where many of its species are found.

## Care Guide
Imshaug's Tube Lichen thrives in environments with high humidity and clean air, characteristic of its native temperate rainforests. Provide indirect light and ensure consistent moisture through regular misting or a naturally humid environment, as it absorbs water directly from the atmosphere. Avoid traditional fertilizers, which can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Lichens derive nutrients from airborne particles and precipitation; good air quality is more important than nutrient supplementation.
