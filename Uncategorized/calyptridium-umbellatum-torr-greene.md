## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine native thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its natural mountainous habitat. It requires infrequent watering once established, tolerating drought conditions, and should not be over-fertilized. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer requirements. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils.
