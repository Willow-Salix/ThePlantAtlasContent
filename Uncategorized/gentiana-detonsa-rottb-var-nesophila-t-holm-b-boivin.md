## 🌱 Overview
Gentiana () is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the gentian family (Gentianaceae), the tribe Gentianeae, and the monophyletic subtribe Gentianinae. With over 300 species, it is considered a large genus. Gentians are notable for their mostly large trumpet-shaped flowers, which are often of an intense blue hue, though some are also bright yellow. The type species of the genus is Gentiana lutea.
The genus name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king who may have discovered tonic properties in gentians.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This subarctic native thrives in cool, bright, and consistently moist conditions, typical of its tundra origin. It requires full sun in cooler environments or bright indirect light in warmer areas, along with well-drained soil that never fully dries out. Minimal fertilization is typically sufficient for healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season is sufficient, or may not be needed in rich soils.
