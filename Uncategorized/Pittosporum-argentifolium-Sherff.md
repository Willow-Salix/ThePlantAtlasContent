## Introduction
Pittosporum ( or ) is a genus of about 250 species of flowering plants in the family Pittosporaceae. Plants in the genus Pittosporum are shrubs or trees with leaves arranged alternately along the stems. The flowers are arranged singly or in cymes, with white to yellow petals fused at the base forming a short tube, with stamens that are free from each other. The fruit is a capsule with a single locule that opens to reveal angular seeds.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native prefers bright conditions, tolerating full sun to partial shade. Provide moderate water, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and apply a light, balanced fertilizer during its growth period to emulate its natural dry to mesic forest habitat.

### Fertilizer
Light, balanced fertilizer application during the active growing season, as forest soils typically have moderate nutrient levels.
