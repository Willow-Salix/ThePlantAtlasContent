## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian native prefers bright conditions, tolerating full sun to partial shade. Provide moderate water, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and apply a light, balanced fertilizer during its growth period to emulate its natural dry to mesic forest habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light, balanced fertilizer application during the active growing season, as forest soils typically have moderate nutrient levels.
