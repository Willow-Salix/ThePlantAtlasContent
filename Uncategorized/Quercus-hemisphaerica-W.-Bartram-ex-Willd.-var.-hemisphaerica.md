## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Coastal Plain, from southeastern Virginia south to Florida, and west to southeastern Louisiana) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth, tolerating partial shade. As a large canopy tree, it needs ample light exposure to thrive. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during establishment. Once mature, it has moderate drought tolerance but benefits from regular watering during prolonged dry spells, mimicking its native humid climate with consistent rainfall. |

## Introduction
Quercus hemisphaerica (sand laurel oak, laurel oak, Darlington oak, laurel-leaf oak) is a species of oak native to the southeastern and south-central United States. It is in the red oak section of Quercus sect. Lobatae. It is often confused with and closely related to Quercus laurifolia (swamp laurel oak), from which it differs in several key characteristics.

## Care Guide
The Darlington Oak thrives in the humid subtropical conditions of the southeastern U.S. It requires full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially when young. Established trees are relatively low-maintenance, needing minimal fertilization and tolerating moderate drought.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer is needed once established in suitable soil. Young trees may benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring to support growth, particularly in poorer soils.
