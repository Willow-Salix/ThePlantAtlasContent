## Care Guide
Fringed Pink thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. It needs moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization. This hardy perennial is relatively low maintenance once established in suitable conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring, as these plants are not heavy feeders
