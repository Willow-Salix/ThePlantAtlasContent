## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full, intense sun and extremely well-draining soil, mimicking its arid native habitat. It requires minimal watering once established, being highly drought-tolerant, and has very low fertilizer needs. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Typically thrives in nutrient-poor soils and does not require regular fertilization. A very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, if any, is sufficient.
