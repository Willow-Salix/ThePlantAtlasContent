| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (specifically, southern Outer North Coast Ranges and inner South Coast Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters), often found on serpentine soils. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) to thrive, reflecting its native open habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growth period in winter and spring, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is adapted to dry summer conditions after flowering, requiring minimal to no water during dormancy. |

## Introduction
Madia is a genus of annual or perennial usually aromatic herbs with yellow flowers, in the tribe Madieae within the family Asteraceae.
They are sometimes known as tarweeds. The species in this genus are native to western North America and southwestern South America. The name Madia is derived from native Chilean name ("Madi") for one of the members of the genus (Madia sativa). Tarweeds derive their common name from the intense stickiness of the plant.

## Care Guide
Hall's Tarplant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean climate. Provide moderate water during its winter/spring growing season, reducing significantly as summer drought approaches. Avoid excessive fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is needed. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, well-drained serpentine soils, and excessive nutrients may be detrimental.
