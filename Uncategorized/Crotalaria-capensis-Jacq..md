## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Africa (primarily South Africa, Eswatini, Mozambique) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Grassland/Savanna and Coastal Thicket |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; thrives with ample direct light for robust growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent watering during the active growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry out slightly between waterings. Reduce frequency in cooler, dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Crotalaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae (subfamily Faboideae) commonly known as rattlepods. The genus includes over 700 species of herbaceous plants and shrubs. Africa is the continent with the majority of Crotalaria species (approximately 400 species), which are mainly found in damp grassland, especially in floodplains, depressions and along edges of swamps and rivers, but also in deciduous bush land, roadsides and fields. Some species of Crotalaria are grown as ornamentals. The common name rattlepod or rattlebox is derived from the fact that the seeds become loose in the pod as they mature, and rattle when the pod is shaken. The name derives from the Ancient Greek κρόταλον, meaning "castanet", and is the same root as the name for the rattlesnakes (Crotalus).
Crotalaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Endoclita sericeus, Etiella zinckenella and Utetheisa ornatrix. The toxic alkaloids produced by some members of this genus are known to be incorporated by Utetheisia larvae and used to secure their defense from predators.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright light and requires moderate, consistent watering during its active growth, with a slight reduction in cooler months. Being a legume, it has modest fertilizer needs, benefiting from a balanced feed but capable of fixing some of its own nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization during the growing season with a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer; as a legume, it has some nitrogen-fixing capabilities.
