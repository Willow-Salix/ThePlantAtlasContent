## Care Guide
Ptychomitrium mosses are robust and adaptable, thriving in bright, exposed conditions and capable of withstanding periods of dryness. They require minimal watering once established and generally do not need fertilization, preferring well-drained substrates and natural environmental inputs.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses generally require minimal nutrients, absorbing what they need from air and water. Fertilization is usually unnecessary and can be detrimental.
