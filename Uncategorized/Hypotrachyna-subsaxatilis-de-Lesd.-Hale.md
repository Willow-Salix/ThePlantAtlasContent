## Introduction
Hypotrachyna is a genus of lichenized fungi within the family Parmeliaceae. According to the Dictionary of the Fungi (10th edition, 2008), the widespread genus contains about 198 species. Hypotrachyna was circumscribed by American lichenologist Mason Ellsworth Hale Jr in 1974.

## Care Guide
Hypotrachyna Lichen flourishes in environments mimicking its native montane rainforests, requiring high ambient humidity and bright, indirect light. Frequent misting is essential for moisture, and traditional fertilizers should be avoided due to the lichen's sensitivity to excess nutrients and pollutants.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens are highly sensitive to pollutants and excess nutrients, which can be detrimental.
