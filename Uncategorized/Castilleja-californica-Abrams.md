## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
California Indian Paintbrush thrives in full sun to partial shade within well-drained soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean climate. It requires infrequent watering once established, preferring moisture during cooler growing seasons but tolerating dry conditions in summer. As a hemiparasite, it needs little to no supplemental fertilizer, obtaining nutrients from host plants.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; Castilleja species are hemiparasitic and obtain nutrients from host plants, thriving in lean soils.
