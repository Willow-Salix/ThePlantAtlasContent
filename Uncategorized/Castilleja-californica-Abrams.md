| **Native Origin** | Central and Northern California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Grasslands, Chaparral, Open Woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade |
| **Watering** | Infrequent once established, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings; prefers moist conditions during cooler growing seasons but requires excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
California Indian Paintbrush thrives in full sun to partial shade within well-drained soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean climate. It requires infrequent watering once established, preferring moisture during cooler growing seasons but tolerating dry conditions in summer. As a hemiparasite, it needs little to no supplemental fertilizer, obtaining nutrients from host plants.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; Castilleja species are hemiparasitic and obtain nutrients from host plants, thriving in lean soils.
