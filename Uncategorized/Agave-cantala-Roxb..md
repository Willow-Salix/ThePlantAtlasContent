## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and proper development. |
| **Watering** | Low; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant, reduce frequency significantly during dormant periods or cooler months. |

## Introduction
Agave (; also UK: ; Anglo-Hispanic, also US: ) is a genus of monocots native to the arid regions of the Americas. The genus is primarily known for its succulent and xerophytic species that typically form large rosettes of strong, fleshy leaves.
Many plants in this genus may be considered perennial, because they require several to many years to mature and flower. However, most Agave species are more accurately described as monocarpic rosettes or multiannuals, since each individual rosette flowers only once and then dies; a small number of Agave species are polycarpic.
Along with plants from the closely related genera Yucca, Hesperoyucca, and Hesperaloe, various Agave species are popular ornamental plants in hot, dry climates, as they require very little supplemental water to survive. Most Agave species grow very slowly. Some Agave species are known by the common name "century plant".
Maguey is a Spanish word that refers to all of the large-leafed plants in the Asparagaceae family, including agaves and yuccas. Maguey flowers are eaten in many indigenous culinary traditions of Mesoamerica.
In other regions, it goes by different names; in China, it is referred to as Chinese: 龙舌兰, romanized: Lóngshélán, lit. 'dragon tongue orchid'.

## Care Guide
Agave cantala thrives in conditions mimicking its arid native habitat, demanding full sun exposure and minimal watering. Ensure extremely well-draining soil to prevent root rot and fertilize very sparingly only during its active growth period. Protect from frost.

### Fertilizer
Low; Agave cantala is not a heavy feeder. Fertilize sparingly once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced, diluted succulent fertilizer.
