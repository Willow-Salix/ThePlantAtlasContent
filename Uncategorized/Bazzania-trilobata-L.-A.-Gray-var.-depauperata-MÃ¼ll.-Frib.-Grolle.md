## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate and Boreal forests of Europe, North America, and parts of Asia |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest, Boreal Forest (understory) |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade. Thrives in very dim, indirect light conditions, mimicking a forest floor beneath a dense canopy. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist substrate; never allow it to dry out. Requires high humidity, often found in constantly damp environments like stream banks or boggy areas. |

## Care Guide
This liverwort requires consistently moist conditions and very high humidity, similar to its native forest understory habitat. Provide low, indirect light and avoid direct sun exposure. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Bryophytes obtain sufficient nutrients from decaying organic matter and atmospheric deposition; excess fertilizer can be detrimental.
