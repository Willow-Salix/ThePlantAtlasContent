## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Cascade Range), including parts of the USA and Canada. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra/Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun, tolerating periods of direct exposure in cool, humid conditions. Avoid intense, hot direct sun. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity is crucial; occasional misting or exposure to dew/rain. Avoid traditional watering or prolonged submersion. Tolerant of dry periods but requires moisture to be active. |

## Introduction
Cetraria is a genus of fruticose lichens that associate with green algae as photobionts. Most species are found at high latitudes, occurring on sand or heath, and are characterised by their "strap-like" form with spiny lobe edges. The lobes can range from narrow and linear to broader and flattened, often forming loose or densely packed cushions. Their distinctive spiny margins serve both a defensive role and aid in vegetative reproduction through fragmentation. The genus was created by Erik Acharius in 1803 and belongs to the large family Parmeliaceae. While originally a species-rich genus, taxonomic revisions since the 1960s have split many species into new genera, though the exact circumscription remains debated among lichenologists.
Several Cetraria species have cultural and economic importance, particularly C. islandica (Iceland moss), which has been widely used in European traditional medicine for treating digestive and respiratory ailments. This species was also historically important as a famine food in Northern Europe and continues to find applications in modern cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Cetraria species are also ecologically important, serving as indicators of air quality and climate change due to their sensitivity to environmental conditions and ability to accumulate various elements, including potentially toxic heavy metals and radioactive isotopes.

## Care Guide
Mimic its native alpine habitat by providing cool temperatures, bright indirect light, and high ambient humidity. Moisture should come from misting or humid air, not traditional soil watering. No fertilization is needed as lichens are highly sensitive to excess nutrients.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and are sensitive to chemical inputs.
