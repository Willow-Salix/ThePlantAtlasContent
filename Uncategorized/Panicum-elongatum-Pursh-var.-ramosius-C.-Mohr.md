## Care Guide
This adaptable grass thrives in temperate forest conditions, preferring consistently moist, well-drained soil and tolerating a range from partial shade to full sun. It requires regular watering to maintain soil moisture and benefits from a light spring fertilization in poorer soils to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, particularly in infertile soils.
