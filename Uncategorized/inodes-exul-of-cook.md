## 🧤 Care Instructions
This robust palm thrives in subtropical to warm temperate climates, preferring full sun exposure. It requires moderate watering, particularly when young, and minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to less fertile native soils. Ensure good drainage and provide ample space for growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils; minimal fertilization (a slow-release palm fertilizer once or twice a year) is generally sufficient.
