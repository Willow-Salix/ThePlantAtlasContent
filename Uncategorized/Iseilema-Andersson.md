## 🧤 Care Instructions
Iseilema grasses require full sun exposure and well-draining soil, thriving when their watering mimics natural monsoonal cycles with distinct wet and dry periods. Provide ample water during active growth and considerably less during dormancy to ensure optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the peak growing season, as they are adapted to natural grassland soils.
