## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (specifically the Great Plains region of the United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open prairie habitat) |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, reflecting the semi-arid conditions of its native grasslands. |

## Care Guide
Western Wheatgrass is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its native prairie environment. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. This makes it ideal for xeriscaping and sustainable landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization. Excessive nutrients can lead to lush but weak growth.
