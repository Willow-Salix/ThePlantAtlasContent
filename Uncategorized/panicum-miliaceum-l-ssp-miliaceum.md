## 🧤 Care Instructions
Broomcorn millet is a resilient, drought-tolerant grain originating from the open steppes of Central Asia. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established and tolerating low to moderate soil fertility. This makes it a low-maintenance plant suitable for a range of conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility; thrives in well-drained, average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization, consistent with plants growing on marginal lands.
