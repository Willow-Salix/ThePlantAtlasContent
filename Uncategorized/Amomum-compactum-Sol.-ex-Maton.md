## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Indonesia, Malaysia (Southeast Asia) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can scorch leaves, mimicking its natural understory habitat. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, similar to the frequent rainfall in its native environment. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, and ensure high humidity. |

## Introduction
Amomum is a genus of plants containing about 111 species native to China, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Queensland. It includes several species of cardamom. Plants of this genus are remarkable for their pungency and aromatic properties.
Among ancient writers, the name amomum was ascribed to various odoriferous plants that cannot be positively identified today. The word derives from Latin amomum, which is the latinisation of the Greek ἄμωμον (amomon), a kind of an Indian spice plant. Edmund Roberts noted on his 1834 trip to China that amomum was used as a spice to "season sweet dishes" in culinary practice.

## Care Guide
Round Cardamom thrives in warm, humid conditions with consistent moisture and bright, indirect light, closely replicating its native tropical rainforest understory environment. Ensure the soil remains moist but well-draining, and provide regular, moderate fertilization during its active growth phases to support its lush foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer), accounting for nutrient leaching common in high-rainfall tropical soils.
