## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caribbean islands (e.g., Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Lesser Antilles), extending into parts of Central America and northern South America. |
| **Climate** | Tropical (often Tropical Savanna or Monsoon), characterized by warm temperatures year-round with distinct wet and dry seasons. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its native habitat in open, exposed tropical areas. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture during its active growing season, especially during periods of high heat, but demands excellent drainage. Allow the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Asclepias is a genus of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants known as milkweeds, named for their latex, a milky substance containing cardiac glycosides termed cardenolides, exuded where cells are damaged. Most species are toxic to humans and many other species, primarily due to the presence of cardenolides. However, as with many such plants, some species feed upon milkweed leaves or the nectar from their flowers. A noteworthy feeder on milkweeds is the monarch butterfly, which uses and requires certain milkweeds as host plants for its larvae.
The Asclepias genus contains over 200 species distributed broadly across Africa, North America, and South America. It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.

## Care Guide
This tropical milkweed flourishes in full sun and needs consistent watering during its growing period, ensuring excellent drainage. Provide light fertilization to support vigorous growth and its characteristic white blooms, vital for attracting pollinators.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer can be applied at half strength every 2-4 weeks during the growing season, or a slow-release granular fertilizer can be incorporated at planting.
