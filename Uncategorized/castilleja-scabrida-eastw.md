## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (primarily California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane Chaparral/Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives with ample direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Low; requires excellent drainage and is drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rough Indian Paintbrush thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native montane chaparral environment. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal watering. Due to its hemiparasitic nature, it needs compatible host plants to absorb essential nutrients and should not be traditionally fertilized.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None required; this plant is hemiparasitic and obtains nutrients from the roots of nearby host plants (typically grasses or other wildflowers). Traditional fertilization can be detrimental.
