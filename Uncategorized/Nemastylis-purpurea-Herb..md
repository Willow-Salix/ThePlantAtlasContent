It is native to Mexico, Central America, and the southern part of the United States. The genus name is derived from the Greek words nema, meaning "thread", and stylos, meaning "pillar" or "rod".

## Care Guide
The Pine Lily thrives in conditions mirroring its native humid subtropical prairies. Provide full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil during its growth period. Fertilize moderately to encourage robust blooming, and reduce water when dormant.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a diluted liquid feed during its active growth phase (spring to early summer).
