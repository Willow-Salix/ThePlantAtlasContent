## Care Guide
The Southern Slender Blue Flag Iris thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently wet soil, reflecting its native bog and wetland environment. It is crucial to prevent the soil from drying out. Minimal fertilization is generally sufficient due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor wetland soils; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring if growth is poor.
