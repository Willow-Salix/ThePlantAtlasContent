## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, mimicking its arid native climate. Use a well-draining soil mix and provide minimal fertilizer only during its spring and summer growing period. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; apply a diluted, balanced cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
