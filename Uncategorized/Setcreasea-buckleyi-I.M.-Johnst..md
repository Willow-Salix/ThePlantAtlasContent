## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South-central and southeastern Texas, USA, and northeastern Mexico (Coahuila, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas). |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical to Semi-arid Grassland and Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect light to partial sun exposure; can tolerate some direct morning sun but should be protected from intense, scorching afternoon sun, especially in hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out completely between waterings; it is drought-tolerant but thrives with consistent, moderate moisture during its active growing season. |

## Introduction
Tradescantia () is a genus of 85 species of herbaceous perennial wildflowers in the family Commelinaceae, native to the Americas from southern Canada to northern Argentina, including the West Indies. Members of the genus are known by many common names, including inchplant, wandering jew, spiderwort, dayflower and trad.
Tradescantia grow 30–60 cm  tall (1–2 ft), and are commonly found individually or in clumps in wooded areas and open fields. They were introduced into Europe as ornamental plants in the 17th century and are now grown in many parts of the world. Some species have become naturalized in regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and on some oceanic islands.
The genus's many species are of interest to cytogenetics because of evolutionary changes in the structure and number of their chromosomes. They have also been used as bioindicators for the detection of environmental mutagens. Some species have become pests to cultivated crops and considered invasive.

## Care Guide
Native to semi-arid to humid subtropical grasslands and shrublands, this plant thrives with bright, indirect light and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions. It is relatively drought-tolerant and benefits from regular light fertilization during its growing period, making it a low-maintenance choice.

### Fertilizer
Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer); reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
