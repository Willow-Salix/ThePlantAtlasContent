## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, primarily California (Sierra Nevada foothills, inner North Coast Ranges, extending to Baja California and parts of Arizona/Nevada) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean climate (chaparral, oak woodlands, grasslands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for optimal flowering, but can benefit from afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during active growth (spring), allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Tolerant of drier conditions once established and approaching natural senescence. |

## Introduction
Githopsis is a small genus of flowering plants in the bellflower family which are known as bluecups. These are small annual wildflowers with white or purple white-throated blooms. Bluecups are native to western North America, especially California. There are four known species within the genus.

## Care Guide
Sierra Bluecup thrives in conditions mimicking its native California Mediterranean climate. Provide full sun to partial shade and moderate watering during its active spring growth, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. It prefers lean to average soil, with minimal fertilization required to encourage abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean to average soils; excessive fertilization can lead to less flowering. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring if soil is very poor.
