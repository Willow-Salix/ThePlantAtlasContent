## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lecidella carpathica thrives in bright, exposed conditions mimicking its native montane habitats. It requires high ambient humidity or occasional rehydration from mist, but can withstand dry periods. No fertilization is needed as it obtains nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens are self-sufficient, deriving trace nutrients from atmospheric deposition and their rock substrate.
