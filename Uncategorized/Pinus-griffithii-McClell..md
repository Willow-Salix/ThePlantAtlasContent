## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Himalayan region (Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, China (Tibet)) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subalpine Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in exposed mountain environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to consistent moisture, especially during the growing season, replicating mountain rainfall patterns. Requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot, tolerating drier periods once established. |

## Introduction
Pinus wallichiana is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Himalaya, Karakoram and Hindu Kush mountains, from eastern Afghanistan east across northern Pakistan and north west India to Yunnan in southwest China. It grows in mountain valleys at altitudes of 1800–4300 m (rarely as low as 1200 m), reaching 30–50 m (98–164 ft) in height. It favours a temperate climate with dry winters and wet summers. In Pashto, it is known as Nishtar.
This tree is often known as Bhutan pine, (not to be confused with the recently described Bhutan white pine, Pinus bhutanica, a closely related species). Other names include blue pine, Himalayan pine and Himalayan white pine.

## Care Guide
This pine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native temperate to subalpine mountain habitat. Provide consistent moisture during its active growth period, ensuring good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Fertilize lightly in spring to support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Apply a balanced evergreen or slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, especially for young trees, reflecting the moderate nutrient availability of forest soils.
