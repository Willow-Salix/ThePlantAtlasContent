## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America, especially the Appalachian Mountains region. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous/Mixed Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to bright indirect light. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can scorch and dry out the moss. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture and high humidity are crucial. Keep the moss damp but not waterlogged, ensuring good air circulation, and mist frequently. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ulota is a genus of mosses comprising 69 species with a worldwide distribution, though most species are found in the southern hemisphere.
They have commonly been grouped within the genus Orthotrichum, though recently they have been placed in their own genus. Their phylogeny and taxonomy have been an area of debate ever since they were placed in their own genus, though it has been largely accepted to place Ulota as a genus of their own. They can be found growing on trees close to the coast, though some species are also found on rocks. Their shoots form small tufts to large mats across habitats, often intertwined with other mosses, including Orthotrichum species.
Ulota reproduce using sexual structures, sporangium (plural: sporangia), that are terminal on the shoot. The calyptra covering the developing sporangium can be hairy or not hairy depending on the species, but the hairs extend from the sporangium base to the apex as opposed to the calyptra hairs of Polytrichum mosses which extend from the apex to the base.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for American Bristle Moss, replicate its humid forest environment with consistent moisture and high humidity, avoiding direct sun. Provide partial shade to bright indirect light and fertilize very sparingly, if at all, to ensure healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses are not heavy feeders; apply an extremely diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/10th strength) sparingly, or rely on ambient nutrients.
