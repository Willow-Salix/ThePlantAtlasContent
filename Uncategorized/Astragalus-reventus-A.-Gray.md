## Care Guide
This hardy perennial thrives in conditions mirroring its native semi-arid, mountainous habitat. Provide full sun and very well-draining, lean soil, as it is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, fertilizer is generally unnecessary and should be avoided.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. Lean, well-draining soil is preferred; excessive fertilizer can be detrimental.
