## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California (USA), specifically the Sierra Nevada foothills and inner North Coast Ranges. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Woodland / Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in full sun with adequate light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Low; highly drought-tolerant once established. Requires infrequent watering, especially during dry summer months, and tolerates periods of extended dryness. |

## Introduction
Calystegia (bindweed, false bindweed, or morning glory) is a genus of about 25 species of flowering plants in the bindweed family Convolvulaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution in temperate and subtropical regions, but with half of the species endemic to California.  They are annual or herbaceous perennial twining vines growing 1–5 m tall, with spirally arranged leaves. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, 3–10 cm diameter, white or pink, with (in most species) a sometimes inflated basal epicalyx.
The genus bears much similarity to a related genus Convolvulus, and is sometimes combined with it; it is distinguished primarily by the pollen being smooth, and in the ovary being unilocular.
Some of the species, notably Calystegia sepium and C. silvatica, are problematic weeds, which can swamp other more valuable plants by climbing over them, but some are also deliberately grown for their attractive flowers.
Calystegia species are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Bedellia somnulentella (recorded on C. sepium) and small angle shades.
The name is derived from two Greek words κάλυξ (kálux) "cup", and στέγη (stégē) "a covering", meaning "covering cup", this refers to the large bracts that cover the sepals.

## Care Guide
This California native, adapted to Mediterranean climates, is exceptionally drought-tolerant and requires minimal care. Plant in full sun to partial shade with well-draining soil, and water sparingly once established. Fertilization is rarely needed.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally not required as it can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Over-fertilization may promote excessive foliage at the expense of flowers.
