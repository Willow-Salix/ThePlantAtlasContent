## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and dry conditions, mimicking its native arid scrubland environment. Provide excellent drainage and water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Fertilization is generally not required due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen from the air, making supplemental nitrogen unnecessary. If growth is poor, a very lean, low-nitrogen formula can be used sparingly.
