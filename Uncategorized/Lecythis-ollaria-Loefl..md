## Introduction
Lecythis ( LESS-ith-iss) is a genus of woody plants in the Lecythidaceae family first described as a genus in 1758. It is native to Central America and South America. Several species produce edible seeds and referred to by a variety of common names including paradise nut, monkey pot, cream nut, and sapucaia nut.
A phylogenetic study published in 2024 by Vargas et al. concluded that Lecythis was polyphyletic. The authors proposed leaving the core Ollaria clade in Lecythis, and placing the Poiteau and Chartacea sections of Lecythis in a revived Chytroma, the Pisonis section in a reinstated Pachylecythis, and the Corrugata clade in the new genus Guaiania.

## Care Guide
This tropical rainforest tree requires bright light to full sun and consistent moisture, mirroring its native habitat. Fertilize moderately during its active growth period to support its robust development, ensuring soil remains moist but not waterlogged.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, balanced fertilizer during the growing season, reflecting the nutrient-rich yet rapidly cycling conditions of tropical forest soils.
