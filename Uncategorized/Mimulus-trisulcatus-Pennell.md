## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid scrubland environment. Water moderately, ensuring the soil dries completely between sessions, and fertilize sparingly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low. Benefits from infrequent, diluted fertilizer in the growing season, reflecting its adaptation to mineral-rich but nutrient-sparse desert soils.
