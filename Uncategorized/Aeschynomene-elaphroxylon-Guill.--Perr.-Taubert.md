## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Africa, especially along the Nile River basin and other slow-moving waterways and floodplains in countries like Sudan, Ethiopia, Chad, Mali, and Niger. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Freshwater Floodplains and Swamps |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright indirect light, mimicking its exposure in open water or along riverbanks. |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet conditions are crucial; roots should remain moist, or even partially submerged in shallow water, reflecting its semi-aquatic nature. |

## Introduction
Aeschynomene elaphroxylon, also known as an ambatch, pith-tree, balsa wood tree, or umburu, is a common large shrub to small tree in the genus Aeschynomene in the family Fabaceae, growing in swamps, lakes and rivers in Tropical Africa. This is an unusual leguminous tree in that it grows in water as a freshwater mangrove, with an extremely lightweight wood acting as a float and a specialised root system sprouting from the trunk which forms a tangled web hanging through the water and sprawling through the mud. It has adventitious roots and roots which are differentiated into special structures adapted to the swamp environment. It can even grow as floating islands of drifting forests.
The name 'ambatch' derives from the name of the plant in the Arabic dialect spoken in Nigeria known as Shuwa by the British. It is called Nile pith tree in Sri Lanka, ambach there and in Malaysia, or ambatsch in Malaysia.
The extremely light, spongy, but rot-resistant wood is traditionally used to make floats for fishing nets and the trunks are lashed together to make rafts, as well as more sophisticated items.

## Care Guide
Ambatch requires a consistently wet environment, ideally mimicking bog or shallow water conditions, and thrives in full sun. Regular fertilization is important to support its vigorous growth, making it suitable for pond margins or specialized aquatic planters.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Benefits from regular feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season, especially in potted environments, to support its rapid growth.
