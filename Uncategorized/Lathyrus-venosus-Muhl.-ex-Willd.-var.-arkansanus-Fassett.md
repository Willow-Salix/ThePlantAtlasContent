## Care Guide
Arkansas Veiny Pea thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil typical of its native temperate woodlands and grasslands. As a legume, it requires minimal fertilization, preferring moderate soil fertility. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry periods, to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Benefits from an annual application of compost or a low-nitrogen, balanced fertilizer in spring if soil is poor.
