## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Brazil (particularly the Atlantic Forest biome in southeastern regions) and other humid tropical/subtropical areas of South America |
| **Climate** | Tropical/Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect to partial shade, mimicking the dappled light found under a dense forest canopy. Avoid direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity and regular exposure to moisture (e.g., misting or rainfall). They do not require traditional watering of soil, as they absorb water directly from the air. |

## Introduction
Parmotrema is a genus of lichen belonging to the family  Parmeliaceae. It is a large genus, containing an estimated 300 species, with a centre of diversity in subtropical regions of South America and the Pacific Islands.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in high humidity and indirect light, much like its native tropical forest habitat. Ensure consistent atmospheric moisture through misting or a humid environment, as it absorbs water directly from the air. Traditional soil watering and fertilization are unnecessary and should be avoided.

### Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer requirements. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and rain; conventional fertilization is not necessary and can be detrimental.
