## Introduction
The genus Scrophularia of the family Scrophulariaceae comprises about 200 species of herbaceous flowering plants commonly known as figworts. Species of Scrophularia all share square stems, opposite leaves and open two-lipped flowers forming clusters at the end of their stems. The genus is found throughout the Northern Hemisphere.
Scrophularia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Phymatopus hectoides.
Some species in this genus are known to contain potentially useful substances, such as iridoids, and several Scrophularia species, such as the Ningpo figwort (S. ningpoensis), have been used by herbal medicine practitioners around the world. The name Scrophularia comes from scrofula, a form of tuberculosis, because several species have been used in herbal medicine for this disease.

## Care Guide
This montane native thrives with consistent moisture in partial sun to partial shade, mimicking its natural habitat near streams. Provide moderate fertility and protect from harsh afternoon sun to ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer in spring should suffice, or none if soil is rich in organic matter.
