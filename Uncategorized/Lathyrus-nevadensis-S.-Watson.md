## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically mountainous regions of the Western United States (e.g., Sierra Nevada, Cascades) and southwestern British Columbia, Canada. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean/Montane (characterized by dry summers, wet winters with rain/snow) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open areas, woodland edges, or slopes where it receives ample light for a significant portion of the day. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering during its active growing season (spring/early summer) but is drought-tolerant once established. Prefers well-drained soil and can withstand dry periods in summer. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Sierra Pea thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native montane habitats. It needs moderate water during active growth but is drought-tolerant once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it requires very little, if any, supplemental nitrogen fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen, so minimal fertilization is typically needed. If growth is poor, a low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
