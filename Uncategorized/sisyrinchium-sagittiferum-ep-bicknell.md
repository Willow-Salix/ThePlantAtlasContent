## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in wet pinelands, flatwoods, and savannas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, bright environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular and consistent watering, keeping the soil moist but not waterlogged, mimicking its native wet pineland habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sisyrinchium is a large genus of annual to perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. Native to the New World, the species are known as blue-eyed grasses. Although they are not true grasses (Poaceae), they are monocots.
Several species in the eastern United States are threatened or endangered. This may be due to niche species emerging from their unique tendency toward rapid speciation which helps them adapt to specialized arenic (sandy) habitats.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spearbract blue-eyed grass thrives in conditions that mimic its native southeastern US habitat, preferring full to partial sun and consistently moist soil. It adapts well to various soil types but appreciates good drainage. Fertilization should be light, as it's not accustomed to overly rich substrates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Its native soils are often sandy and not overly rich; a light, balanced fertilizer or compost can be applied sparingly if growth seems weak.
