## Introduction
Chenopodium is a genus of numerous species of perennial or annual herbaceous flowering plants known as the goosefoot, which occur almost anywhere in the world. It is placed in the family Amaranthaceae in the APG II system; older classification systems, notably the widely used Cronquist system, separate it and its relatives as Chenopodiaceae, but this leaves the rest of the Amaranthaceae polyphyletic. However, among the Amaranthaceae, the genus Chenopodium is the namesake member of the subfamily Chenopodioideae.

## Care Guide
This adaptable plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil. Fertilize moderately during its active growth period to support healthy development. It is relatively low-maintenance, reflecting its opportunistic nature as a plant often found in disturbed areas.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring to late summer), applied monthly at half strength.
