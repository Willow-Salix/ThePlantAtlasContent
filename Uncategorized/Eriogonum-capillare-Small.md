## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arizona, USA (specifically Gila County and surrounding areas) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sun daily), as it grows in open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, mimicking its native arid conditions. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
San Carlos Buckwheat thrives in conditions mimicking its native Arizona chaparral, requiring full sun and very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. It prefers lean, well-drained soil and generally does not require fertilization. Overwatering and rich soils should be avoided to prevent rot and promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. It thrives in lean, poor soils and too much nutrient can be detrimental.
