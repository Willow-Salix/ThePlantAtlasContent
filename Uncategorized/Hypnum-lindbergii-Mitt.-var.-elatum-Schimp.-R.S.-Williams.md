## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |

| **Climate** | Cool Temperate to Boreal Forest/Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade, consistent with its habitat on forest floors or in shaded wetland areas. Direct sun can cause desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist conditions, mimicking its native boggy or damp forest floor habitats. Never allow the substrate to dry out completely. High ambient humidity is crucial. |

## Care Guide
Lindberg's Feather Moss thrives in cool, shaded, and consistently moist environments, much like its native boreal wetlands and forest floors. Provide high humidity and avoid direct sunlight and rich fertilizers, as it is adapted to low-nutrient conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. Mosses are adapted to nutrient-poor environments and can be sensitive to excessive nutrients.
