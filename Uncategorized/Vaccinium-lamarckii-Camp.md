| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America, including eastern Canada (e.g., Quebec, Maritime Provinces) and the northeastern United States (e.g., New England, Great Lakes region) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest Edges, Heathlands, and Boreal Barrens |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun (at least 6-8 hours direct sunlight) for optimal fruit production, tolerating light partial shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, well-drained, acidic soil. Water regularly, especially during dry spells and fruit development, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Blueberries are a widely distributed and widespread group of perennial flowering plants with blue or purple berries. They are classified in the section Cyanococcus within the genus Vaccinium. Commercial blueberries—both wild (lowbush) and cultivated (highbush)—are all native to North America. The highbush varieties were introduced into Europe during the 1930s.
Blueberries are usually prostrate shrubs that can vary in size from 10 centimeters (4 inches) to 4 meters (13 feet) in height. In the commercial production of blueberries, the species with small, pea-size berries growing on low-level bushes is known as "lowbush blueberries" (synonymous with "wild"), while the species with larger berries growing on taller, cultivated bushes is known as "highbush blueberries". Canada is the leading producer of lowbush blueberries, while the United States produces some 29% of the world's supply of highbush blueberries.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Lowbush Blueberry, provide a location with full sun and ensure its acidic soil remains consistently moist but well-drained. Mimicking its native heathland environment, it requires minimal, acid-specific fertilization to thrive.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a plant adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils, use acid-specific fertilizers sparingly in early spring, or incorporate organic matter like compost. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
