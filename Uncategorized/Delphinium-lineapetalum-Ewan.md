## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (primarily California, Nevada, Oregon) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine (found in open coniferous forests, meadows, and slopes at high elevations) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun in cooler climates or at higher altitudes, but benefits from afternoon shade in hot summer regions. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering is needed to keep the soil consistently moist, especially during dry periods. Requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot, reflecting its native well-drained, often rocky, soils. |

## Introduction
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## Care Guide
Thinpetal Larkspur thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native montane meadow habitat. Ensure good air circulation and avoid waterlogging. Amend soil with organic matter and provide moderate fertilization in spring for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Benefits from soil rich in organic matter (compost) and a balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied in early spring to support vigorous growth and flowering.
