## Care Guide
This riparian tree thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native stream-side habitat in Southern California's mountains. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is generally robust, fixing its own nitrogen. Ensure constant moisture, especially during warm periods, and provide adequate light for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a nitrogen-fixing tree, it enriches the soil and generally requires minimal supplemental nitrogen. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be used sparingly if growth is poor.
