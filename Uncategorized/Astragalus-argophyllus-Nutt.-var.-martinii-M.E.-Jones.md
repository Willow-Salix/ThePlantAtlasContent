## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil with very infrequent watering. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires minimal to no fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for arid gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. If needed, a very light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen.
