## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia (e.g., Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Rainforest / Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light; avoid direct sun, which can scorch its delicate fronds. Dappled light conditions are ideal. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and frequent moisture. Keep the growing medium constantly damp but not waterlogged. Misting regularly or growing in a humid environment (like a terrarium) is crucial. |

## Care Guide
Reinwardt's zygodon moss thrives in consistently humid, low-light environments, mimicking its native tropical montane cloud forest. Ensure continuous moisture without waterlogging and provide excellent air circulation to prevent rot. Fertilization is generally not required, focusing instead on maintaining high humidity and filtered light.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs and can be harmed by over-fertilization. If desired, use a highly diluted (e.g., 1/8 strength) liquid fertilizer very sparingly, perhaps once or twice a year.
