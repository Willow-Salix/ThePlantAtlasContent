## Introduction
Lesquerella is the former name of a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Recent work has shown that Lesquerella is indistinct from the genus Physaria and both genera have been united under Physaria. In addition, the former Lesquerella of the southeastern United States have been moved to the genus Paysonia since 2002. The genus Lesquerella is now no longer applied to any species and is considered defunct.
The genus is named in honor of Leo Lesquereux, 1805–1889, Swiss and American botanist.

## Care Guide
This rare plant thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native cold desert environment. It requires very infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization, preferring poor, well-draining, and potentially saline-alkaline soils. Overwatering or rich soil can be detrimental to its health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer, as it is adapted to poor, barren, saline-alkaline soils.
