## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Sierra Nevada, Cascade Range, Rocky Mountains) |
| **Climate** | Montane/Subalpine Conifer Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun; avoid intense, direct midday sun. Grows epiphytically on conifer branches, often exposed. |
| **Watering** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and regular misting, as it absorbs moisture directly from the air. Tolerates periods of dryness but needs moisture for metabolic activity. |

## Introduction
Letharia is a genus of fruticose lichens belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. Molecular phylogenetics studies have revealed that what were once considered just two species actually represent at least several distinct evolutionary lineages, with western North America serving as the centre of diversity for the group. These lichens typically grow on sun-exposed wood and bark of coniferous trees, growing in dry habitats where they receive moisture from dew or fog.

## Care Guide
Letharia californica, a lichen, thrives in high humidity and bright indirect to partial sun, typical of its montane conifer forest habitat. It requires regular misting for moisture absorption and obtains nutrients naturally from the environment, making traditional fertilizer unnecessary. Good air circulation is also beneficial.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required; obtains necessary nutrients from the air, rain, and the substrate it grows on.
