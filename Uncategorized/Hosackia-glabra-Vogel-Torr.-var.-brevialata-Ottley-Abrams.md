## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Woodland and Shrubland (Chaparral) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. This plant grows in open, exposed dry areas, indicating a need for direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent to moderate watering. Given its Mediterranean climate origin with dry summers and wet winters, it requires regular water during its active growing season (late winter to spring) but is highly drought-tolerant and needs very little to no water during the summer dormancy. Ensure excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Hosackia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae (legumes). It is native to western North America, from British Columbia in Canada to Mexico.

## Care Guide
Smooth Hosackia thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its native Californian chaparral environment. Provide consistent water during its spring growing period, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and greatly reduce or withhold water during the summer. This plant is a low feeder and requires minimal fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Plants from chaparral and dry grasslands are typically adapted to nutrient-poor or moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilizing can be detrimental; a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring, if at all, is sufficient.
