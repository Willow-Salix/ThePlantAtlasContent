## Introduction
Onobrychis, the sainfoins, are a genus of Eurasian perennial herbaceous plants of the legume family (Fabaceae). About 206 species are presently accepted. The Flora Europaea lists 23 species of Onobrychis; the main centre of diversity extends from Central Asia to Iran, with 56 species – 27 of which are endemic – in the latter country alone. O. viciifolia is naturalized throughout many countries in Europe and North America grasslands on calcareous soils.

## Care Guide
Pallas' Sainfoin is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained, poor to moderately fertile soils, characteristic of its native temperate steppe habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established. Avoid over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen and thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Supplemental fertilizer is rarely needed.
