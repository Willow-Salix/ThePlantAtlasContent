# Telaranea Nematodes

*Telaranea nematodes (Gottsche ex Austin) M. Howe* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate regions, including eastern North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically moist woodlands, peatlands, and swamps) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to indirect light; prefers shaded conditions and must be protected from direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist substrate is essential; requires high humidity and frequent misting, or growth in a closed terrarium environment. |

## Care Guide
Telaranea nematodes thrives in cool, consistently moist, and highly humid conditions with very low light, mirroring its native temperate forest and peatland environments. Maintain a constantly damp (but not waterlogged) substrate and ensure high ambient humidity, ideally within a terrarium setup. Fertilization is rarely needed and should be applied extremely sparingly if at all.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. If absolutely necessary, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very infrequently.
