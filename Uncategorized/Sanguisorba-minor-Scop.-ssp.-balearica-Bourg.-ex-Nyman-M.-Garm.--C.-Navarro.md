## Care Guide
Originating from Mediterranean scrublands, Small Burnet thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. It is very drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering only when the soil is dry. Fertilize lightly in spring if needed, but avoid over-feeding.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, especially in nutrient-poor soils, but it generally does not require heavy feeding.
