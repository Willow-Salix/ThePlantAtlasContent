## Introduction
Boesenbergia rotunda (Thai: กระชาย, romanized: krachai, Khmer: ខ្ជាយ, romanized: k'jeay, Indonesian: temu kunci, Burmese: ဆိတ္ဖူး, romanized: Hsei' Hpu), commonly known as Chinese keys, fingerroot, lesser galangal or Chinese ginger, is a medicinal and culinary herb from China and Southeast Asia. In English, the root has traditionally been called fingerroot, because the shape of the rhizome resembles that of fingers growing out of a center piece.
