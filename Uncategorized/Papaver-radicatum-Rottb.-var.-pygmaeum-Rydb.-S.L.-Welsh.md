## Care Guide
The Pygmy Arctic Poppy thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its high alpine tundra origins. Provide regular watering during its brief growing period, but ensure excellent drainage and avoid over-fertilization to mimic its natural, nutrient-poor habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; prefers lean, rocky soils and does not tolerate rich or heavily fertilized conditions.
