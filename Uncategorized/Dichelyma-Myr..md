# Dichelyma Moss

*Dichelyma Myr.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Hemisphere, including North America (e.g., Canada, northern USA), Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Central Europe), and parts of Asia |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Freshwater Aquatic/Semi-aquatic Environments (e.g., lakes, slow-moving streams, bogs, wetlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade. As an aquatic moss, it typically receives filtered light or grows in shaded areas along water bodies, so direct, intense sunlight should be avoided. |
| **Watering** | Constant moisture is critical; this moss requires either full submersion in cool, clear water or a consistently saturated substrate with very high ambient humidity if grown emergent. It cannot tolerate drying out. |

## Care Guide
Dichelyma Moss is an aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that requires cool temperatures, consistent moisture (preferably submerged), and high humidity. Protect it from strong, direct sunlight and avoid letting it dry out, as it has very low nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Mosses are not heavy feeders. For submerged growth, sufficient dissolved nutrients in the water are usually adequate. If grown emergent, a very dilute, infrequent liquid fertilizer might be considered, but is often unnecessary.
