## Care Guide
Provide a stable, suitable substrate (e.g., bark, rock, or concrete) in an area with moderate to high light exposure and good air circulation. Ensure periodic access to environmental moisture from rain or high humidity, as traditional watering and fertilization are not applicable for this lichen.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, aerosols) and surface runoff from their substrate.
