## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of North America (Pacific Northwest), Europe, and East Asia |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforest / Humid Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Very low to low, indirect light; thrives in deeply shaded or filtered light conditions, mimicking a dense forest understory. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and frequent moisture from the air; regular misting or placement in a terrarium with high ambient humidity is essential. Avoid direct watering of the substrate as it absorbs moisture from the air and rain. |

## Care Guide
To care for this lichen, replicate its temperate rainforest habitat by providing very low, indirect light and maintaining consistently high humidity. Ensure regular misting or a humid enclosure, and avoid traditional fertilization, as it absorbs nutrients directly from the environment.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed; lichens obtain essential nutrients from atmospheric particles, rain, and the substrate they grow on (bark, decaying wood).
