## 🧤 Care Instructions
This terrestrial orchid thrives in cool, moist, shaded conditions typical of North American temperate forests. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and should be protected from direct sunlight. Feed lightly during active growth to support its humus-rich soil preference.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced, diluted fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) during its active growing season. It naturally grows in humus-rich, often calcareous soils.
