## Introduction
Dioscorea is a genus of over 600 species of flowering plants in the family Dioscoreaceae, native throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of the world. The vast majority of the species are tropical, with only a few species extending into temperate climates. It was named by the monk Charles Plumier after the ancient Greek physician and botanist Dioscorides.

## Care Guide
This tropical yam thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light to partial sun. It needs consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from regular fertilization during its growing period to encourage healthy tuber development.

### Fertilizer
Requires regular feeding during its active growing season with a balanced fertilizer, potentially one higher in potassium to support tuber development, as it would access rich organic matter in its native tropical soils.
