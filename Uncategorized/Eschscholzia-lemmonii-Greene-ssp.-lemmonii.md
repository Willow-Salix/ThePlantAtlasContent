## Care Guide
Lemmon's Poppy is a robust, drought-tolerant wildflower that thrives in full sun exposure and well-draining, poor to moderately fertile soils. Mimicking its native arid scrubland environment, it requires minimal watering once established and generally performs best without additional fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Supplemental fertilization is generally not required and can lead to excessive foliage growth at the expense of blooms.
