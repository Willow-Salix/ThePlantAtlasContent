## 🌱 Overview
Oreocarya (perennial cat's-eye) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. There are about 63 species and its native range extends from western and central Canada, through western United States to north Mexico. It is part of subtribe of Amsinckiinae.
It was once thought to be a either a subgenus or synonym of Cryptantha Lehm. ex G. Don, as they both had plenty of tiny flowers, hairy leaves, and persisting dried flower stems.
Botanist William Alfred Weber later noted that the 2 genera were different in form as Oreocarya was a "biennial or perennial from rosettes of basal leaves; flowers more than 5 mm in diameter, often distinctly long-tubular with prominent yellow eye", while Cryptantha was an "annual without rosettes of basal leaves; flowers minute, less than 5 mm diameter, short-tubed with inconspicuous eye".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert annual flourishes in full sun and extremely well-draining, infertile soil. It requires minimal water, tolerating extended dry periods, and benefits from little to no fertilization. Emulate arid conditions for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its native desert habitat.
