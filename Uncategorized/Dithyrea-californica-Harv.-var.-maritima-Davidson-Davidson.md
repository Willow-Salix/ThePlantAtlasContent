## Introduction
Dithyrea (shieldpod) is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae containing only one or two species. The California shieldpod or spectacle-pod, Dithyrea californica, is an abundant and unique-looking herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The beach shieldpod, Dithyrea maritima, a rare plant found only on the coast of California and Baja California, is sometimes considered a subspecies of D. californica.

## Care Guide
Coastal Twinpod thrives in very sunny, well-drained conditions, typical of its native coastal California habitat. It requires minimal watering once established, being highly drought-tolerant, and prefers poor, sandy soils. Avoid overwatering and excessive fertilization to prevent root rot and ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils and generally does not require fertilization. If necessary, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
