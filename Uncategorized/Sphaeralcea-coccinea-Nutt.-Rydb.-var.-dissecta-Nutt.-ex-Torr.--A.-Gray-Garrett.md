## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western and Central North America, including the Great Plains, intermountain regions, and desert southwest of the United States and Canada |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Temperate Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it thrives in open, exposed environments. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; once established, water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to rot. |

## Introduction
Sphaeralcea is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family (Malvaceae). There are about 40-60 species, including annuals, perennials, and shrubs. Most originate in the drier regions of North America, with some known from South America. They are commonly known as globemallows, globe mallows, false mallows or falsemallows. The name of the genus is derived from the Greek words σφαῖρα (sphaira), meaning "sphere," and αλκεα (alkea), meaning "mallow."
The leaves of these plants are spirally arranged, and usually palmate or toothed. Both stems and leaves are downy. Like other Malvaceae, the flowers are saucer- or cup-shaped, with the stamens joined into a column in the center.
Sphaeralcea species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia olivacea, which has been recorded on S. lindheimeri.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant perennial thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soil, characteristic of its native arid grasslands. It requires infrequent watering once established, mimicking its adaptation to low rainfall environments, and generally needs little to no fertilizer to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to lean or poor soils in its native habitat and generally does not require additional fertilizer. Over-fertilization can promote weak, leggy growth.
