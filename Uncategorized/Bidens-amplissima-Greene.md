## Introduction
Bidens is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. The genus include roughly 230 species which are distributed worldwide. Despite their global distribution, the systematics and taxonomy of the genus has been described as complicated and unorganized. The common names beggarticks, black jack, burr marigolds, cobbler's pegs, Spanish needles, stickseeds, tickseeds and tickseed sunflowers refer to the fruits of the plants, most of which are bristly and barbed. The generic name refers to the same character; Bidens comes from the Latin bi ("two") and dens ("tooth").

## Care Guide
This wetland species thrives in persistently saturated soil conditions, preferring full sun to light shade exposure. It typically benefits from naturally rich organic matter in its habitat and requires minimal additional fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; often sufficient with natural organic matter present in wet soils, but a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied if growth seems stunted.
