### *Coincya monensis (L.) Greuter & Burdet ssp. recurvata (All.) Leadley*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern Europe (including France, Spain, Portugal, Italy) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its growth in open, exposed areas of its native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring less water during hot, dry summer periods typical of its native climate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Coincya monensis subsp. recurvata, the star mustard or wallflower cabbage, is a subspecies of Coincya monensis.
It is found in eight U.S. states. It may have been introduced to the U.S. as the Isle of Man cabbage and subsequently evolved through the founder effect and geographic isolation into a new subspecies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Star-mustard thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native Mediterranean climate in Southwestern Europe. It prefers well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering during its active growing season and very little in dry periods. Fertilization needs are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to less nutrient-rich environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization, if any. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer diluted to half strength once or twice during the active growing season is sufficient, especially in poor, sandy soils.
