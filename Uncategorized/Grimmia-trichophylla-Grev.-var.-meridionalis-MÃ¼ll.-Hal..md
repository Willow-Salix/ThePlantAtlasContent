## Care Guide
This moss thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean dryland habitat. Provide high light and allow for complete drying between infrequent waterings, as it's adapted to desiccation. Fertilizer is generally unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer; mosses derive nutrients from air and substrate, not requiring rich soil.
