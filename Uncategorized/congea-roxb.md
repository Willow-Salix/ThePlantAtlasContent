## 🌱 Overview
Congea is a small genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae, first described by William Roxburgh in 1820.
It contains vines native to southern China, the Himalayas, and Southeast Asia that are rarely seen in cultivation outside the 
tropics. One species, Congea tomentosa, is occasionally grown in large greenhouses, but this is mainly restricted to conservatories on large estates or botanic gardens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Congea thrives in bright conditions, ideally full sun to partial shade, mirroring its tropical forest margin origins. It requires consistent moisture during its active growing season, with reduced watering in cooler or dormant periods, and benefits from regular fertilization. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed regularly with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Reduce or cease fertilization during dormancy.
