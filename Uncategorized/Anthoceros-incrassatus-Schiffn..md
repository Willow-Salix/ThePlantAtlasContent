| **Climate** | Tropical/Subtropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to indirect light, mimicking a forest floor environment away from direct sun |
| **Watering** | Maintain consistently moist but well-draining substrate; high atmospheric humidity is crucial through misting or a humid environment. |

## Care Guide
This hornwort thrives in consistently moist, humid, and shaded conditions reminiscent of its native tropical/subtropical forest floor. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging and rot, while maintaining high atmospheric humidity and constant substrate dampness. Fertilization needs are minimal due to its nature as a bryophyte.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; if used, a highly diluted liquid bryophyte-specific fertilizer once or twice a year is sufficient.
