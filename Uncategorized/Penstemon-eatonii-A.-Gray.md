## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the southwestern United States (Arizona, Utah, Nevada, California, Colorado, New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert Biome |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily). High light intensity is essential for robust growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Very low. Highly drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering is detrimental. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
Firecracker Penstemon thrives in full sun and dry conditions, mirroring its native arid scrubland and desert habitat. It requires very little watering once established and prefers lean, well-draining soil, making fertilization generally unnecessary. Mimic its native environment for best results.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to poor soils. Avoid rich organic matter or heavy fertilization, as this can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering. Fertilize minimally or not at all.
