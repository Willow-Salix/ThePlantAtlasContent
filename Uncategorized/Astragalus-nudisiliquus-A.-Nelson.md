## Care Guide
The Cobblestone Milkvetch thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native arid to semi-arid grasslands. It requires infrequent watering, being highly drought-tolerant, and has low fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it a low-maintenance plant.
