## Care Guide
Scorpion Senna, originating from the Mediterranean, thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly drought-tolerant once established. It requires well-drained soil and benefits from moderate watering only during prolonged dry spells. Its nitrogen-fixing capabilities mean it has low fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; being a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive fertilization is not required. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if soil nutrients are poor.
