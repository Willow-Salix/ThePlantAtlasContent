| **Native Origin** | Greenland (coastal Arctic and subarctic regions) |
| **Climate** | Arctic/Subarctic Tundra (specifically saline coastal areas or salt marshes) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, adapted to long daylight hours and open, exposed environments with lower sun intensity. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil, often found in areas with regular access to water from snowmelt or tidal influence, and tolerant of saline conditions. Avoid prolonged drought or stagnant water. |

## Care Guide
This arctic grass thrives in cool, exposed conditions with full to partial sun. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, tolerating saline environments. Nutrient needs are generally low.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to nutrient-poor Arctic soils, but saline environments can sometimes offer concentrated minerals. A light application of balanced fertilizer if growth is slow.
