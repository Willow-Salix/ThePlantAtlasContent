## Introduction
Hypoxis  is a  genus of flowering plants of the family Hypoxidaceae. The genus has an "almost cosmopolitan" distribution, occurring in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Australia. Europe lacks native species. Most species are in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in southern Africa. Common names for the genus include star-grass, star lily, yellow stars, African potato, and stars. The genus is the largest of the Hypoxidaceae and has its centre of variation in South Africa, where it occurs in open undisturbed grasslands. The name Hypoxis was taken over by Linnaeus in 1759 from a name coined by Paul Reneaulme in 1611 for a superficially similar species of Gagea and meaning "a little sour", referring to the taste of that plant's leaves.

## Care Guide
This plant prefers bright, open conditions with full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is relatively low maintenance, requiring regular watering and occasional fertilization to support vigorous growth. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from a light, balanced fertilizer during its active growing season in nutrient-poor soils.
