## Introduction
The genus Dendrolycopodium is a clubmoss genus in the family Lycopodiaceae. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), it is placed in the subfamily Lycopodioideae. Some sources do not recognize the genus, sinking it into Lycopodium. It is treated as section Obscura when retained within Lycopodium. The genus includes a discrete group of plants with similar morphologies.  All have erect to semi-erect, branched stems.

## Care Guide
Tree Clubmoss thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, replicating its native temperate forest floor habitat. It requires consistently moist, well-drained, acidic soil and benefits from light, infrequent fertilization. Protect it from direct sunlight and maintain high ambient humidity.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization, if any, during the growing season. A diluted balanced liquid fertilizer or organic top-dressing is suitable.
