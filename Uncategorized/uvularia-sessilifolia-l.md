## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America (Eastern United States and southeastern Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade, particularly avoiding intense direct afternoon sun which can scorch its delicate leaves, mimicking its understory habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the soil consistently moist but well-drained, especially during the growing season; it thrives in conditions similar to a forest floor rich in organic matter. |

## 🌱 Overview
Uvularia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Colchicaceae, which is closely related to the lily family (Liliaceae). They are commonly called bellworts, bellflowers, or merrybells. The genus name is derived from the Latin ūvula meaning "little grape", likely because of the way the flowers hang downward. For the same reason Uvularia may also refer to the similarly derived palatine uvula, which hangs down from the soft palate in the mouth. The plants are often found growing on wooded slopes or in ravines and they spread by stolons, or stoloniferous rhizomes. The plants are usually 45–60 cm (18–24 in) in height and bear one or two flowers per stem in April and May, that hang downward from the axils of the leaves.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, Sessileleaf Bellwort requires a shaded to partially shaded location with consistently moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Avoid allowing the soil to dry out completely, and provide a light feeding of organic fertilizer or compost in spring to mimic its natural forest environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a light annual application of balanced organic matter or a slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, reflecting the nutrient cycling in its native woodland soil.
