## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (from Alaska and British Columbia south to California, and east to Wyoming and Montana) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Woodland and Riparian Zones |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. It can tolerate full sun in cooler regions but benefits from some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist to wet; it thrives in moist environments, often found near streams and wet areas, and does not tolerate prolonged drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Scouler's Willow requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, mirroring its native riparian habitat. It can tolerate a range of light from full sun to partial shade, and benefits from light annual fertilization. Ensure ample water to prevent drought stress.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization in spring with a balanced all-purpose fertilizer is sufficient, especially if growth is slow. Willows are generally not heavy feeders.
