## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and Baja California, Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Grassland and semi-arid regions, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily). It thrives in open, exposed locations, mimicking its native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, as it is susceptible to root rot in consistently wet conditions. |

## Introduction
Asclepias is a genus of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants known as milkweeds, named for their latex, a milky substance containing cardiac glycosides termed cardenolides, exuded where cells are damaged. Most species are toxic to humans and many other species, primarily due to the presence of cardenolides. However, as with many such plants, some species feed upon milkweed leaves or the nectar from their flowers. A noteworthy feeder on milkweeds is the monarch butterfly, which uses and requires certain milkweeds as host plants for its larvae.
The Asclepias genus contains over 200 species distributed broadly across Africa, North America, and South America. It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.

## Care Guide
This resilient milkweed thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it perfect for dry or native garden settings. Once established, it requires minimal watering and does best in lean soils, making it an excellent drought-tolerant choice for attracting pollinators.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required. This plant is adapted to lean or poor soils; rich or heavily fertilized soil can be detrimental to its health.
