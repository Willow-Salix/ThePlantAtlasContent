## Introduction
Streptanthus glandulosus subsp. albidus is a subspecies of flowering plant in the mustard family known by the common name Metcalf Canyon jewelflower.

## Care Guide
This California native thrives in full sun and very well-draining, infertile soil, mimicking its serpentine habitat. Provide moderate water during its growing season but allow for a dry period during summer dormancy, and avoid rich fertilizers to ensure its health.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, mineral-rich serpentine soils; over-fertilization can be detrimental.
