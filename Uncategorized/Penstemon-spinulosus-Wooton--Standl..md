## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full sun and requires well-drained soil, mimicking its arid habitat. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing. Its drought tolerance makes it suitable for xeric landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low nutrient needs. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release formula in spring. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
