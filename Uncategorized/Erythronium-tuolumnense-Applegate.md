## Introduction
Erythronium, the fawn lily, trout lily, dog's-tooth violet or adder's tongue, is a genus of Eurasian and North American plants in the lily family, most closely related to tulips. The name Erythronium derives from Ancient Greek ἐρυθρός (eruthrós) "red" in Greek, referring to the red flowers of E. dens-canis. Of all the established species, most live in North America; only six species are found in Europe and Asia.

## Care Guide
To care for the Tuolumne Fawnlily, mimic its native woodland understory environment by providing partial to full shade and consistently moist soil during its active growth in late winter and spring. It requires a significant dry period as it goes dormant through the hot summer. Incorporate organic matter to enrich the soil.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with organic matter (such as compost) in late winter or early spring as new growth emerges, mirroring the nutrient cycle of woodland soils.
