## 🌱 Overview
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This woodland native thrives in cool, shaded environments with consistently moist, well-drained soil. It requires minimal fertilization, preferring conditions that mimic its forest floor habitat with decomposing organic matter to maintain health and vigor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from an annual application of organic matter or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer, as it typically grows in soils rich from decomposing forest litter.
