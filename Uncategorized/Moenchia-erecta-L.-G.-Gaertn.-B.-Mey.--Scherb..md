## Introduction
Moenchia is a genus of plants in the family Caryophyllaceae with three species native to the Mediterranean region of southern Europe and naturalised in southern Africa and parts of North America and Australia. They are herbs, with an annual life span. They have slender roots and thin stems that are upright or ascending. Inflorescences are one- to three-flowered and terminally end the stems. The flowers are in spreading cymes or solitary, with bracts paired that are leaf like. Named after the 18th century German botanist Conrad Moench. A common name for the plants in this genus is upright chickweeds.
The species was first published by Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart in 'Neues Mag. Aerzte' Vol.5 Issue 3, on page 203 on 11 June 1783.

## Care Guide
Upright Chickweed thrives in full to partial sun conditions with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native temperate grassland habitat. Water regularly, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings, and apply a light fertilizer during its active growth phase. Ensuring good drainage is crucial to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding during the active growing season; often found in moderately fertile soils.
