## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically Pacific Northwest (e.g., Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, British Columbia) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine Meadow / Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun, tolerating full morning sun or high altitude exposure with adequate moisture. Prefers some afternoon shade in warmer regions. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil. Water regularly, ensuring soil does not dry out completely, especially during active growth, mimicking snowmelt and consistent rainfall. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
Western Saxifrage thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained conditions, typical of its native subalpine and alpine meadows. Provide bright indirect to partial sun, consistent moisture without waterlogging, and light fertilization during the growing season. Ensure good drainage to mimic its rocky, mountainous habitat and prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding. A balanced, dilute fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, or incorporate organic matter into the soil to provide slow-release nutrients.
