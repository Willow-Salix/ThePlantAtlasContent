## Introduction
Ibervillea is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae.
Its native range is Arizona, Oklahoma New Mexico, Texas and south to Mexico, Belize and Guatemala.
The genus name of Ibervillea is in honour of Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville (1661–1706), a soldier, ship captain, explorer, colonial administrator, knight of the Order of Saint-Louis, adventurer, privateer, trader, member of Compagnies Franches de la Marine and founder of the French colony of Louisiana in New France.
It was first described and published in Erythea Vol.3 on page 75 in 1895.

## Care Guide
Mimic its desert origin by providing abundant sunlight and very little water, especially during its dormant period to prevent rot. Ensure excellent drainage with a gritty soil mix, and offer minimal fertilization only during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; a balanced, dilute liquid fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer) but is often not strictly necessary.
