## Care Guide
The Ladder Brake fern thrives in consistently moist soil and high humidity, requiring bright indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight which can scorch its fronds and ensure the soil never completely dries out. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted solution during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength, once a month during spring and summer.
