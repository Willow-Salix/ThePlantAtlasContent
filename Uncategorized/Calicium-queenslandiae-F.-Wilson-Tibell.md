| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Queensland, Australia |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Rainforest/Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade; prefers indirect or dappled light to avoid desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and frequent access to moisture (rain, dew, mist). Cannot be 'watered' like a vascular plant; thrives in consistently moist, but not waterlogged, conditions, tolerating dry spells. |

## Introduction
Calicium is a genus of leprose lichens. It is in the family Caliciaceae, and has 40 species.
The sexual reproduction structures are a mass of loose ascospores that are enclosed by a cup shaped exciple sitting on top of a tiny stalk, having the appearance of a dressmaker's pin (called a mazaedium), hence the common name pin lichen. They are also commonly called stubble lichens.
They have been used as indicator species for old growth redwood forests.

## Care Guide
As a lichen native to subtropical Queensland, this species thrives in high humidity and partial to full shade, typically on bark or decaying wood. It requires no soil or traditional watering, absorbing moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere and substrate, tolerating periods of dryness.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required. Obtains nutrients from atmospheric deposition and its substrate (bark, wood, rock).
