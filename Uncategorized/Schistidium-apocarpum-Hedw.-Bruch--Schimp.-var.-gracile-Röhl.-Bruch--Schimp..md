## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and arctic-alpine regions globally, including North America, Europe, Asia, and parts of the Southern Hemisphere. |
| **Climate** | Temperate, Boreal, Arctic, Alpine |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to bright indirect light, tolerates some direct morning sun. As it often grows on exposed rocks, it's adapted to relatively high light conditions for a moss. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is preferred, but this moss is highly tolerant of desiccation and can rehydrate quickly. Water when the surface appears dry, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
This hardy moss thrives in moderate to bright indirect light and requires consistent moisture, though it is quite tolerant of dry periods. Avoid deep shade and ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. No special fertilization is needed, as it has very low nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Mosses have very low nutrient requirements and absorb what they need from water and airborne particles. Over-fertilization can be harmful.
