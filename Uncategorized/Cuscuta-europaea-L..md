## Introduction
Cuscuta europaea, the greater dodder or European dodder, is a parasitic plant native to Europe, which belongs to the family Convolvulaceae, but was formerly classified in the family Cuscutaceae. It grows on Asteraceae, Cannabaceae, Amaranthaceae, Fabaceae, Urticaceae and other herbaceous plants, including garden plants such as Coleus and Impatiens, and more occasionally on Humulus. It is a notable parasite of lucerne (Medicago sativa). In many regions, including the Nepal Eastern Himalayas, this species are used as traditional medicine to treat hepatic diseases.

## Care Guide
Greater dodder is an obligate parasitic plant that derives all its water, nutrients, and carbohydrates directly from a host plant, to which it attaches via haustoria. It does not require soil fertilization or direct watering, as its needs are entirely met by the health and vitality of its chosen host. Therefore, cultivating this plant primarily involves providing a suitable and thriving host.

### Fertilizer
No direct fertilizer requirements for the plant itself, as it is an obligate parasite deriving all nutrients from its host.
