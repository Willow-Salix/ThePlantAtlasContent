## Introduction
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## Care Guide
The Scaly Blazingstar flourishes in full sun and well-drained, sandy soil, reflecting its native pine flatwood and savanna habitats. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and is quite drought-tolerant once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it prefers leaner soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient. It naturally thrives in average to somewhat poor, sandy soils.
