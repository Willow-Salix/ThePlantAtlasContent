## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania) and New Zealand. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forests, Woodlands, and Grasslands. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Shade to Full Shade. Prefers indirect light or dappled sunlight, mimicking its native understory and open but often shaded habitats. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, but well-draining soil. Water regularly, ensuring the soil does not dry out completely between waterings, reflecting its natural occurrence in damp situations and along stream banks. |

## Introduction
Chrysopsis (golden asters) are plants in the family Asteraceae native to the southern and eastern United States. All the species are found in Florida, although some are found in other states as well.
These are annual and perennial herbs bearing daisy-like flower heads with yellow disc florets and usually yellow ray florets. Some species formerly classified in this genus are now included in other genera: Heterotheca, Pityopsis, Stenotus, Ionactis, Aster, Eucephalus, Erigeron, Machaeranthera, Croptilon, Xanthisma, Oclemena, Bradburia, Oxypappus, Arnica, and Helichrysopsis.
Golden asters are often used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Schinia petulans (which feeds exclusively on C. subulata).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in partial to full shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mirroring its native damp forest and grassland habitats. It requires regular watering to maintain soil moisture and benefits from occasional, diluted fertilization during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied during the active growing season (spring/summer). Avoid over-fertilization, as it is not a heavy feeder.
