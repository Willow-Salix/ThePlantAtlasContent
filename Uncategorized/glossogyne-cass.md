## 🧤 Care Instructions
Glossogyne thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its native grassland habitats. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between sessions, and provide light fertilization during growth. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overly rich, waterlogged conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer can be applied every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
