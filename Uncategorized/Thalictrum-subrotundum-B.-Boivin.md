## Introduction
Thalictrum ( ) is a genus of 120-200 species of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae, native mostly to temperate regions. Meadow-rue is a common name for plants in this genus.
Thalictrum is a taxonomically difficult genus with poorly understood species boundaries; it is in need of further taxonomic and field research for clarification.
Despite their common name of "meadow-rue", Thalictrum species are not closely related to the true rue (family Rutaceae), but resemble its members in having compound leaves twice or thrice divided.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in temperate climates with full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and moderate watering, but can tolerate some dry spells. Fertilization is generally minimal, suitable for low to moderately fertile soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil is poor; otherwise, generally not required.
