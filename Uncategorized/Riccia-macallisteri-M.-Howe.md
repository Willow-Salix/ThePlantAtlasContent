## Care Guide
Macallister's Crystalwort is an aquatic liverwort requiring continuous submersion in clean, stable freshwater with bright, indirect to moderate light. It benefits from low to moderate nutrient levels, readily absorbing them from the water, and care should be taken to prevent excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, absorbing nutrients directly from the water column; avoid over-fertilization to prevent algae growth
