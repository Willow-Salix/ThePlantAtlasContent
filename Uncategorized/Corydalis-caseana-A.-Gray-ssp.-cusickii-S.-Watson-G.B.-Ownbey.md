## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Washington) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Moist Meadows and Stream Banks |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade; can tolerate some morning sun, but protect from intense afternoon sun to prevent scorching. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist, especially during the growing season, mimicking its native habitat in wet meadows and stream banks. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Corydalis (from Greek korydalís "crested lark") is a genus of about 540 species of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Papaveraceae, native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere and the high mountains of tropical eastern Africa. They are most diverse in China and the Himalayas, with at least 357 species in China. Corydalis species are the only dicots having only a single cotyledon (seed leaf).

## Care Guide
Cusick's Fumewort thrives in cool, consistently moist conditions reminiscent of its high-altitude subalpine home. Provide bright, indirect light or partial shade, and ensure the soil remains damp but well-draining. Fertilize sparingly, as it is adapted to lean mountain soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or integrate organic matter into the soil rather than heavy feeding.
