## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (specifically Molokai) |
| **Climate** | Coastal Dry Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6+ hours of direct sunlight daily, reflective of its native exposed coastal habitats. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering once established, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, consistent with its adaptation to dry coastal environments. |

## Introduction
Pseudognaphalium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as cudweeds or rabbit tobacco (P. obtusifolium is the original species with that name). They are widespread in tropical and temperate regions of many countries.
Species have been moved between Pseudognaphalium and the related genus Gnaphalium.

## Care Guide
This 'ena'ena variety thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, adapting to its native dry coastal environment. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to fully dry out, and avoid over-fertilizing as it prefers lean conditions. Ensure protection from excessive moisture to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; if necessary, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly once a year during its growing season, as it thrives in lean, rocky soils.
