## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma), extending into parts of Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Dry Forest / Montane Forest, characterized by distinct seasons, cold winters, warm dry summers, and moderate rainfall. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade. In hotter climates, some afternoon shade can be beneficial to prevent leaf scorch, especially when young. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering when young to establish. Mature trees are notably drought-tolerant but will benefit from supplemental watering during prolonged dry periods to maintain vigor. |

## Introduction
Acer grandidentatum, commonly called bigtooth maple or western sugar maple, is a species of maple native to interior western North America. It occurs in scattered populations from western Montana to central Texas in the United States and south to Coahuila in northern Mexico.

## Care Guide
This hardy maple is well-adapted to temperate climates with cold winters and warm, often dry, summers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Once established, it is relatively drought-tolerant but appreciates consistent moisture during extended dry spells for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is typically needed for established trees in healthy soil. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if growth is poor or soil nutrients are lacking.
