## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native subalpine meadow habitat. Provide moderate watering during its growing season, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertility requirements. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial, but avoid over-fertilization due to its adaptation to lean, rocky soils.
