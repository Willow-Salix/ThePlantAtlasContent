## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full sun and requires very little water, reflecting its arid homeland. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot, allowing the soil to dry completely between infrequent waterings, and fertilize sparingly if at all.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; if desired, apply a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once during the active growing season.
