## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia (e.g., Vietnam, Thailand, southern China, Malaysia, Indonesia) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Humid (submerged/emergent in freshwater streams within rainforests/monsoon forests) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate light. Thrives in shaded conditions or under a canopy, avoiding direct, intense sunlight. In an aquarium, this translates to typical low to medium intensity aquarium lighting. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant submersion in stable freshwater or extremely high humidity with consistently moist substrate if emergent. Prefers regular water changes in an aquarium setting to maintain water quality. |

## Care Guide
This tropical aquatic moss thrives in stable freshwater environments with low to moderate light and consistent submersion. It requires moderate nutrients from the water column and benefits from stable water parameters, making it suitable for aquariums with appropriate lighting and water quality management.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. Benefits from liquid fertilization in the water column, receiving nutrients from dissolved minerals and organic matter. Over-fertilization should be avoided to prevent algae growth.
