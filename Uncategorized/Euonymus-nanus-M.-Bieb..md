## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |

| **Native Origin** | Southeastern Europe, Caucasus Mountains, Siberia, and Western China (Xinjiang) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subalpine Continental Climate (montane forest edges, rocky slopes, scrublands) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to full sun. In its native habitat, it can be found in open woodlands or exposed rocky areas, suggesting tolerance for a range of light but prefers at least a few hours of direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Originating from areas with distinct seasons and often well-drained, rocky soils, it prefers consistent moisture but is tolerant of some drought once established. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
Dwarf Euonymus is a hardy plant that thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native montane and continental climates. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and is generally not a heavy feeder. Ensure good drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It naturally grows in average to poor, rocky soils. Heavy fertilization is generally not needed. A light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient if soil is poor or growth is desired.
