## Care Guide
This Hawaiian hybrid thrives in conditions similar to its native tropical rainforest, requiring indirect light and consistently moist substrate without being waterlogged. High humidity is crucial for its well-being. Provide infrequent, light fertilization during its growth phases.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a dilute liquid fertilizer (e.g., ¼ strength) during active growth, typically once a month.
