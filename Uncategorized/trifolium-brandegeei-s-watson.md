| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (USA: Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine and Alpine Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in high light conditions typical of mountain environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture during the growing season, especially in well-drained soil. Tolerant of periods of dryness once established, but prefers regular watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Brandegee's Clover requires full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during its active growth phase. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Emulate its native subalpine/alpine environment by providing ample light and moderate, regular watering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. Supplemental phosphorus and potassium may be beneficial if soil is very poor, but heavy fertilization is generally unnecessary.
