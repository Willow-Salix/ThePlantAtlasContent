# Hybrid Marram
### *Ã—Ammocalamagrostis baltica (Flugge ex Schrad.) P. Fourn.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal regions of Northern Europe, particularly around the Baltic Sea. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Coastal Dunes |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun exposure, typical of open dune environments with no overhead canopy. At least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily is ideal. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established, adapted to fast-draining sandy soils. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hybrid marram grass thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils, reflecting its native coastal dune environment. It requires minimal watering once established and is adapted to low nutrient conditions, making it a highly low-maintenance plant suitable for challenging sites.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility requirements. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, perhaps once a year in spring with a low-nitrogen, balanced slow-release fertilizer, or avoid in naturally poor sandy soils.
