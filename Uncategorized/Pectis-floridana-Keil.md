## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Florida, USA |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Pine Flatwoods |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) to ensure robust growth and flowering, replicating its open habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between applications. More frequent watering is beneficial during hot, active growing periods, but reduce significantly during cooler, drier seasons. |

## Introduction
Pectis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1759.
The name is derived from the Latin word pecten, meaning "comb." It refers to the marginally-bristled leaves or the pappus form.  These plants vary in appearance but they usually bear yellow daisy-like flower heads. Members of the genus are known generally as cinchweeds (current usage) or chinchweeds (older name).
They are native to the Americas, including the West Indies.

## Care Guide
This chinchweed thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its native open pine flatwoods habitat. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs due to its adaptation to sandy soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As it naturally occurs in sandy, often less fertile soils, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is generally sufficient.
