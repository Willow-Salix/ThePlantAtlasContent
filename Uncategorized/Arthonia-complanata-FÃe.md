## Care Guide
Dot lichen (Arthonia complanata FÃ©e) thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest habitat. It requires high humidity, consistently moist air, and low to indirect moderate light. Fertilization is generally not needed, as it absorbs nutrients from the environment.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens absorb trace nutrients from the air, dust, and rainfall. Conventional fertilizers are not necessary and can be harmful.
