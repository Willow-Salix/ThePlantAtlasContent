# Tehama Copper Moss

*Mielichhoferia tehamensis Showers* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (endemic to Tehama County) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean climate, specifically in moist, shaded microhabitats on serpentine (ultramafic) rock outcrops or seeps. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to indirect bright light. Requires protection from direct, intense sunlight, especially during hot periods. |
| **Watering** | Keep the substrate consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Mimic its native environment of constant hydration from seeps or protected fissures. |

## Care Guide
This rare moss thrives in specialized conditions, requiring a mineral-rich, serpentine-like substrate with consistent moisture but excellent drainage. It prefers partial shade and should be protected from direct, harsh sunlight. Fertilization needs are extremely low.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs. If used, apply a highly diluted, balanced fertilizer very sparingly (e.g., once or twice a year), as its natural substrate is often nutrient-poor but mineral-rich.
