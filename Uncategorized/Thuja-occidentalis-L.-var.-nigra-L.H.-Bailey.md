## Introduction
Thuja ( THEW-yə) is a genus of coniferous tree or shrub in the Cupressaceae (cypress family). There are five species in the genus, two native to North America and three native to eastern Asia. The genus is monophyletic and sister to Thujopsis. Members are commonly known as arborvitaes (from the Latin term for 'tree of life'), thujas, or New World false cedars.

## Care Guide
This arborvitae thrives in consistently moist, well-drained soil under full sun to partial shade, reflecting its temperate forest and wetland origins. Regular watering is crucial, particularly during dry spells or establishment, while light fertilization in spring supports its growth without excessive demands.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula in spring is usually sufficient, as it grows in varied native soils, from nutrient-poor to rich.
