## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of Europe, North America, and other continents, particularly in sandy habitats. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Open, Sandy Environments / Heathland |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers bright, indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate full sun in temperate zones but should be protected from intense, direct midday sun in warmer climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires infrequent watering. Allow substrate to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid waterlogging, mimicking the well-drained conditions of sandy native habitats. |

## 🌱 Overview
Microcalicium is a genus  of lichen-forming fungi in the order Pertusariales. It is the only genus in the monotypic family Microcaliciaceae. These taxa were circumscribed by the Finnish lichenologist Edvard August Vainio in 1927, with Microcalicium disseminatum assigned as the type species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in bright, indirect light to partial sun, typical of its native temperate sandy environments. Watering should be infrequent, allowing the substrate to dry completely, and no supplemental fertilization is needed. Emulate well-drained, open conditions for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens are self-sufficient, deriving nutrients from the air, rain, and the substrate itself.
