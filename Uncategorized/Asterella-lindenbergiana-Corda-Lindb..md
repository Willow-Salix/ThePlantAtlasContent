## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of North America (e.g., Eastern United States, Canada), Europe, and parts of Asia |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest Understory |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate, indirect light. Avoid any direct sun exposure, which can easily scorch the delicate thallus. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist conditions and high humidity; never allow the substrate to dry out completely. Regular misting or a humid environment (like a terrarium) is essential. |

## Care Guide
Lindenberg's Asterella thrives in conditions replicating its native cool temperate forest understory, demanding low to moderate indirect light and exceptionally high humidity. Maintain a consistently moist substrate without waterlogging, and use fertilizers very sparingly due to its sensitivity.

### Fertilizer
Very low; liverworts are highly sensitive to fertilizers. If absolutely necessary, apply a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly once or twice a year.
