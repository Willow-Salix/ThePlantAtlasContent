## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including Arctic and sub-Arctic areas of North America (Greenland, Alaska, Canada, Rocky Mountains), Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; tolerates high light in cool conditions, prefers some afternoon shade in warmer climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil, thriving on meltwater from snow beds. Requires good drainage to prevent waterlogging, but the soil should not be allowed to dry out during the growing season. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ranunculus pygmaeus, the pygmy buttercup or dwarf buttercup, is a species of buttercup found throughout the Arctic, as well as in the mountains of Norway and the Rocky Mountains. A few populations also exist in the Eastern Alps and Tatra Mountains.

It is a small plant, prostrate-ascending, 1–5 cm tall. The stems are single-flowered, with the basal leaves numerous. The leaves are deeply cleft into 3-5 lobes. The flowers are 5–6 mm in diameter, with five pale yellow petals, and five hairy sepals. After flowering, the stems stretch considerably, reaching far above the basal leaves. It grows in snowbeds, moss carpets and other moist localities.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Pygmy Buttercup thrives in cool, moist conditions characteristic of alpine and arctic tundra. Provide consistently moist, well-drained soil and full to partial sun, especially avoiding intense afternoon sun in warmer climates. It requires minimal fertilizer, adapting well to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native soils are typically nutrient-poor, so over-fertilization can be detrimental. If growth is very slow, a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer might be applied once early in the growing season.
