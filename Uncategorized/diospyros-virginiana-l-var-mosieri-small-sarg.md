## 🌱 Overview
Diospyros virginiana is a persimmon species commonly called the American persimmon, common persimmon, eastern persimmon, simmon, possumwood, possum apples,  or sugar plum. It ranges from southern Connecticut to Florida, and  west to Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa. The tree grows in the wild but has been cultivated for its fruit and wood since prehistoric times by Native Americans. Both the tree and the fruit are referred to as persimmons, with the latter appearing in desserts and cuisine in the U.S. South and Midwest.
The tree is typically dioecious, so one must have both male and female plants to obtain fruit.
Commercial varieties include the very productive Early Golden, the productive John Rick, Miller, Woolbright and the Ennis, a seedless variety. Another nickname of the American persimmon, 'date-plum' also refers to a persimmon species found in South Asia and South Europe, Diospyros lotus. Today, persimmons are also grown on small farms as a heritage crop.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The American Persimmon, including this variety, is a highly adaptable tree native to the Eastern and Central U.S. It thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, becoming drought-tolerant once mature. Requires minimal fertilization, primarily to support healthy growth and fruit development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer can be applied annually in spring, especially for fruiting trees, but it is not a heavy feeder.
