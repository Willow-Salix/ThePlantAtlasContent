## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia), Central America, Northern South America (e.g., Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil), and parts of East Asia. |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Humid Forest (often Montane or Coastal) |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to bright indirect light; typical of a forest understory or canopy edge where it receives dappled sunlight rather than intense, direct sun. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is paramount. Frequent misting or occasional soaking (simulating rainfall) is necessary to keep the thallus hydrated. Allow for good air circulation to prevent prolonged dampness and potential rot. |

## Introduction
Parmotrema is a genus of lichen belonging to the family  Parmeliaceae. It is a large genus, containing an estimated 300 species, with a centre of diversity in subtropical regions of South America and the Pacific Islands.

## Care Guide
Rimelia simulans thrives in humid environments with moderate, indirect light, mimicking its native subtropical and tropical forest habitats. Maintain high humidity and provide regular moisture through misting or simulated rainfall, ensuring good air circulation. Fertilizers are not needed and can be harmful to this delicate lichen.

### Fertilizer
None required. Lichens derive nutrients from the air and rainwater; conventional fertilizers are harmful and should be strictly avoided.
