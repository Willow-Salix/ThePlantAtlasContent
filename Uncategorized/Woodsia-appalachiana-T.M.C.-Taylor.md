## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America (primarily southeastern and central United States, extending into Canada) |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate Forests, specifically moist, sheltered crevices of rocky cliffs and ledges |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade. Protect from direct afternoon sun, especially in warmer climates, as it naturally grows in shaded rock crevices. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, mimicking the steady moisture found in its sheltered rock habitats. Requires good drainage. |

## Introduction
Woodsia is a genus of ferns in the family Woodsiaceae. Species of Woodsia are commonly known as cliff ferns. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), it was the only genus in the family Woodsiaceae. In 2020, Physematium was split off from Woodsia on the basis of molecular phylogenetic evidence. As of June 2023, Plants of the World Online continued to treat Physematium as a synonym of Woodsia.

## Care Guide
The Appalachian Cliff Fern thrives in cool, humid conditions with partial to full shade, replicating its natural habitat in Appalachian cliff crevices. Ensure the soil remains consistently moist but not soggy, with excellent drainage, and provide only light fertilization during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding. Use a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once a month during the growing season, or even less frequently) due to its natural occurrence in nutrient-poor rocky crevices.
