## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Developed in cultivation (United Kingdom) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. This reflects its adaptation to open garden environments in temperate regions. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate; regular watering until established, then relatively drought-tolerant. This aligns with typical rainfall patterns in temperate climates, where it can withstand periods of drier conditions once mature. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cotoneaster  is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, native to the Palaearctic region (temperate Asia, Europe, north Africa), with a strong concentration of diversity in the genus in the mountains of southwestern China and the Himalayas. They are related to hawthorns (Crataegus), firethorns (Pyracantha), photinias (Photinia), and rowans (Sorbus).
Depending on the species definition used, between 70 and 300 different species of Cotoneaster are described, with many apomictic microspecies treated as species by some authors, but only as varieties by others.
The majority of species are shrubs from 0.5–5 m (1.6–16.4 ft) tall, varying from ground-hugging prostrate plants to erect shrubs; a few, notably C. frigidus, are small trees up to 15 m (49 ft) tall and 75 cm (30 in) trunk diameter. The prostrate species are mostly alpine plants growing at high altitudes (e.g. C. integrifolius, which grows at 3,000–4,000 m (9,800–13,100 ft) in the Himalayas), while the larger species occur in scrub and woodland gaps at lower altitudes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Waterer's Cotoneaster thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate watering, especially during establishment, after which it becomes more drought-tolerant. It is adaptable to average garden soils with low to moderate fertilizer needs, making it a robust choice for temperate climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average garden soils and does not typically require heavy fertilization, consistent with the nutrient availability in many temperate garden settings.
