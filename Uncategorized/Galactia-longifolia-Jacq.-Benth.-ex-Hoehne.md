| **Native Origin** | Caribbean islands (e.g., Puerto Rico, Cuba), southeastern United States (Florida), and parts of Central and South America (e.g., Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil). |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Savanna and Dry Scrubland/Grasslands. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. It thrives in environments with ample direct sunlight for at least 6 hours daily, typical of open grasslands and scrub areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring less frequent watering during drier periods or dormancy. |

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native open, sunny habitats. Water moderately during active growth, allowing for dry periods, and provide minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. A balanced, low-strength fertilizer may be applied sparingly in very poor soils, but high nitrogen fertilizers should generally be avoided.
