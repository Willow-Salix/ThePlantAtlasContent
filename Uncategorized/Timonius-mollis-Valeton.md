## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Santa Cruz Islands |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect light or partial shade. Protect from intense, direct sun, especially during the hottest parts of the day, as this can scorch its leaves. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking its rainforest habitat. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil begins to dry, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## Care Guide
As a native of tropical rainforests, Soft Timonius thrives in high humidity and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide bright, indirect light and protect it from harsh direct sun, along with regular feeding during warmer months to support its lush growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding during its active growing season (spring and summer). Use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks.
