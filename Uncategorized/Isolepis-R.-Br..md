## Care Guide
Isolepis thrive in consistently wet to submerged conditions under full sun to partial shade, making them ideal for bog gardens or water features. Provide a dilute fertilizer occasionally during growth to support healthy foliage, ensuring the roots are always moist.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season.
