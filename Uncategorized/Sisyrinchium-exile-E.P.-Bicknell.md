## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas), Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Grasslands and Moist Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours direct sun per day) to mimic its open field habitat. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, allowing the top inch to dry slightly between waterings. Regular watering is essential, especially during dry periods. |

## Introduction
Sisyrinchium is a large genus of annual to perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. Native to the New World, the species are known as blue-eyed grasses. Although they are not true grasses (Poaceae), they are monocots.
Several species in the eastern United States are threatened or endangered. This may be due to niche species emerging from their unique tendency toward rapid speciation which helps them adapt to specialized arenic (sandy) habitats.

## Care Guide
To care for Sisyrinchium exile, provide full to partial sun and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil. It benefits from light fertilization during its active growing season to support its vigorous nature in subtropical to warm temperate grassland conditions.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season, or a slow-release granular fertilizer in spring. Avoid over-fertilization as it is adapted to moderately rich soils.
