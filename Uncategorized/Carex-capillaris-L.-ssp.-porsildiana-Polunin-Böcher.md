## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Subarctic regions, including Greenland, Arctic Canada, Alaska, Northern Europe, and Northern Asia |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Bright light to full sun exposure, adapted to lower light intensity due to low sun angle, but requires long daylight hours during short growing season. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist, especially during the active growing season, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, mimicking melting snow and permafrost conditions. |

## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Porsild's Hair Sedge thrives in cold, bright conditions characteristic of the Arctic Tundra. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil during its brief growing season and ample light but protection from excessive heat. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments, fertilization should be kept to a bare minimum.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is needed, as native tundra soils are typically very nutrient-poor. If used, apply a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly only during the active growing period.
