## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, including Southern Europe (e.g., Italy, Greece) and North Africa |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring less water during dry summer periods, consistent with its adaptation to dry Mediterranean summers. |

## Introduction
Helianthemum (), known as rock rose, sunrose, rushrose, or frostweed, is a genus of about 110 species of flowering plants in the family Cistaceae. They are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, especially in the Mediterranean.
New World species formerly classified as Helianthemum have been transferred to genus Crocanthemum.

## Care Guide
This Sun Rose thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its Mediterranean origins. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. Minimal fertilization is generally sufficient for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor, well-drained soils; an annual light application of balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary.
