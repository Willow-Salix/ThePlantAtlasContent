## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bering Willow thrives in cool, subarctic to arctic climates, preferring full sun and consistently wet to moist soil conditions. Ensure high humidity and provide ample water, replicating its native riparian or wet tundra habitat. Fertilization should be light, as it's adapted to less nutrient-rich environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to naturally nutrient-poor soils, but can benefit from light, balanced fertilization in cultivation
