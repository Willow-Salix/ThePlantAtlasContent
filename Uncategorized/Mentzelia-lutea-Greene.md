| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah) and Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure, mimicking its native habitat in open, unshaded desert and scrubland environments. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soil, typical of its arid native habitat. It requires infrequent watering, being highly drought-tolerant, and should be protected from excessive moisture. Fertilization is rarely necessary, as it adapts well to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer needed; thrives in lean to poor soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, if at all, is sufficient.
