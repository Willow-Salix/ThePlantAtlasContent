## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soil, typical of its arid native habitat. It requires infrequent watering, being highly drought-tolerant, and should be protected from excessive moisture. Fertilization is rarely necessary, as it adapts well to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer needed; thrives in lean to poor soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, if at all, is sufficient.
