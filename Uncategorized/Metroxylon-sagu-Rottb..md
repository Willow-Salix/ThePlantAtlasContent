## Introduction
Sago palm is a common name for several plants which are used to produce a starchy food known as sago. Sago palms may be "true palms" in the family Arecaceae, or cycads with a palm-like appearance. Sago produced from cycads must be detoxified before consumption. Plants called sago palm include:

Metroxylon (true sago palms), a genus in the palm family (Arecaceae) native to Southeast Asia
Cycads
Cycas revoluta, (king sago palm), native to Japan and widely cultivated as an ornamental plant
Cycas rumphii, (queen sago palm), native to southeast Asia
Cycas circinalis, (queen sago palm), native to India

## Care Guide
Metroxylon sagu thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical swamp environments. It requires bright, indirect to full sun exposure, consistently moist to wet soil, and benefits from high humidity. Regular fertilization during the active growing season will support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
