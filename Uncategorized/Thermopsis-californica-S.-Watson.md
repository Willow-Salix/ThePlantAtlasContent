## Care Guide
California Goldenbanner thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring only occasional watering during dry spells. As a nitrogen-fixing plant, it has low fertilizer needs and performs well in less fertile conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so heavy fertilization, especially with nitrogen, is generally not needed. Thrives in average to poor soils.
