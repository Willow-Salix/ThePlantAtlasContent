## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically California, Nevada, and surrounding mountainous regions of Utah, Oregon, Idaho, and Washington. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Semi-Arid Montane Chaparral and Woodland (dry rocky slopes, pinyon-juniper woodland). |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in high light exposure typical of open, dry slopes and woodlands. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. It is highly drought-tolerant, adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns. Water infrequently but deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant clover prefers full sun and lean, well-draining soils, mimicking its native semi-arid montane habitat. It requires infrequent, deep watering and very little, if any, fertilization, as it is adapted to rocky, dry conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in lean, well-draining soils with minimal nutrient input. Fertilization is generally not necessary.
