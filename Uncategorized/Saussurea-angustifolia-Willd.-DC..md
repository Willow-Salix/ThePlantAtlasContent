## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Siberia, Mongolia, China (Xinjiang, Tibet), Central Asia |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright, open conditions typical of high-altitude environments. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture during the growing season, but excellent drainage is crucial. Prefers soil that is moist but never waterlogged, mimicking snowmelt and rocky alpine soils. |

## Introduction
Saussurea is a genus of about 300 species of flowering plants in the tribe Cardueae within the family Asteraceae, native to cool temperate and arctic regions of East Asia, Europe, and North America, with the highest diversity in alpine habitats in the Himalayas and East Asia. Common names include saw-wort and snow lotus, the latter used for a number of high altitude species in East Asia.
They are perennial herbaceous plants, ranging in height from dwarf alpine species 5–10 cm (2–4 in) tall, to tall thistle-like plants up to 3 m (9.8 ft) tall. The leaves are produced in a dense basal rosette, and then spirally up the flowering stem. The flowers form in a dense head of small capitula, often surrounded by dense white to purple woolly hairs; the individual florets are also white to purple. The wool is densest in the high altitude species, and aids in the thermoregulation of the flowers, minimising frost damage at night and also preventing ultraviolet light damage from the intense high-altitude sunlight.
De Candolle named the genus after Horace-Bénédict de Saussure (1740–1799) and Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure (1767–1845).

## Care Guide
This alpine species thrives in bright, open environments with full to partial sun. It requires consistently moist, but extremely well-drained soil, and prefers low to moderate nutrient levels. Ensure proper drainage to prevent root rot, especially in cooler conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Alpine soils are typically lean, so a light, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly during active growth is sufficient.
