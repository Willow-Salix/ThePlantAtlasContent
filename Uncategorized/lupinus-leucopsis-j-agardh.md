## 🧤 Care Instructions
Whitewoolly Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring temperate dry conditions. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal watering and no high-nitrogen fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it a low-maintenance plant for appropriate climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in poor to moderately fertile soil and does not need supplemental nitrogen. Excess nitrogen can hinder flowering.
