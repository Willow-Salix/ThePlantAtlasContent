## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arizona, USA |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Sonoran Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours direct sunlight daily) is ideal to prevent etiolation and promote robust growth. |
| **Watering** | Very low. Drought-tolerant. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water sparingly, especially during cooler months, to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Agave (; also UK: ; Anglo-Hispanic, also US: ) is a genus of monocots native to the arid regions of the Americas. The genus is primarily known for its succulent and xerophytic species that typically form large rosettes of strong, fleshy leaves.
Many plants in this genus may be considered perennial, because they require several to many years to mature and flower. However, most Agave species are more accurately described as monocarpic rosettes or multiannuals, since each individual rosette flowers only once and then dies; a small number of Agave species are polycarpic.
Along with plants from the closely related genera Yucca, Hesperoyucca, and Hesperaloe, various Agave species are popular ornamental plants in hot, dry climates, as they require very little supplemental water to survive. Most Agave species grow very slowly. Some Agave species are known by the common name "century plant".
Maguey is a Spanish word that refers to all of the large-leafed plants in the Asparagaceae family, including agaves and yuccas. Maguey flowers are eaten in many indigenous culinary traditions of Mesoamerica.
In other regions, it goes by different names; in China, it is referred to as Chinese: 龙舌兰, romanized: Lóngshélán, lit. 'dragon tongue orchid'.

## Care Guide
Toumey's Century Plant flourishes in conditions mimicking its arid desert home, demanding full sun and extremely infrequent watering. Ensure well-draining soil and minimal fertilization to prevent common issues like root rot, making it a low-maintenance choice for bright, dry environments.

### Fertilizer
Low. Fertilize once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer) with a diluted, balanced succulent or cactus fertilizer. Avoid over-fertilization.
