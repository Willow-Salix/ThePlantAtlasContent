## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah) and Northern Mexico (Baja California) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert (Mojave and Sonoran Deserts) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed desert environments with no canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Very low watering; extremely drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry completely between waterings, and water sparingly, especially once established. Overwatering is detrimental. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
Kidney-leaf Buckwheat thrives in arid conditions, demanding full sun and excellent drainage. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and benefits from little to no fertilization. This plant is well-suited for xeriscaping and desert gardens.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Desert soils are typically nutrient-poor, and these plants are adapted to such conditions. Excessive fertilization can harm them.
