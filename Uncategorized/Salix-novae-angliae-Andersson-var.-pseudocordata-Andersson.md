## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This willow thrives in full sun to partial shade and demands constantly wet or very moist soil, making it ideal for boggy areas, stream banks, or ponds. It is relatively low-maintenance regarding fertilization, flourishing in naturally rich, organic substrates common to its native riparian habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Prefers naturally rich, alluvial soils; supplemental fertilization is generally not heavily required if organic matter is present, but a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be used if soil nutrients are poor.
