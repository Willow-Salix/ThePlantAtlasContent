## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
Rocky Mountain Goldenrod thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native rocky alpine and subalpine habitats. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings, and minimize fertilization to ensure optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean, rocky, nutrient-poor soils typical of alpine environments.
