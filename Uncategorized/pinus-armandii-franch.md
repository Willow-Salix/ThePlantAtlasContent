## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Western China (provinces like Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei), Taiwan, and northern Myanmar |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Montane Temperate Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflecting its native high-altitude, open canopy habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings; ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot, as it is adapted to well-drained mountain soils. |

## 🌱 Overview
A pine is any conifer in the genus Pinus () of the family Pinaceae. Pinus is the sole genus in the subfamily Pinoideae. The species are evergreen trees or shrubs with their leaves in bunches, usually of 2 to 5 needles. The seeds are carried on woody cones, with two seeds to each cone scale.
Pines are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere; they occupy large areas of taiga (boreal forest), but are found in many habitats, including the Mediterranean Basin, and dry tropical forests in southeast Asia and Central America. Some are fire-resistant or fire-dependent. 
Pine trees provide one of the most extensively used types of timber. The seeds are used to make dishes such as pesto, while retsina wine is flavoured with pine resin.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Armand pine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native montane environment. Provide moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and apply light fertilizer in spring. Preventing waterlogging is crucial for its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization in spring with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer formulated for conifers; avoid over-fertilizing as it is accustomed to less rich montane soils.
