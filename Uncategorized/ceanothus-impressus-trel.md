## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal Santa Barbara County, California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland/Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) for best growth and flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely drought-tolerant once established; requires infrequent, deep watering during the cooler, wet season, and very little to no supplemental water during hot, dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ceanothus is a genus of about 50–60 species of nitrogen-fixing shrubs and small trees in the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae). Common names for members of this genus are buckbrush, California lilac, soap bush, or just ceanothus. "Ceanothus" comes from Ancient Greek: κεάνωθος (keánōthos), which was applied by Theophrastus (371–287 BC) to an Old World plant believed to be Cirsium arvense.
The genus is native to North America with the highest diversity on the western coast. Some species (e.g., C. americanus) are restricted to the eastern United States and southeast Canada, and others (e.g., C. caeruleus) extend as far south as Guatemala. Most are shrubs 0.5–3 metres (1.6–9.8 ft) tall, but C. arboreus and C. thyrsiflorus, both native to California, can be small multi-trunked trees up to 6–7 metres (20–23 ft) tall.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Santa Barbara Ceanothus thrives in full sun and Mediterranean climates, requiring minimal water once established due to its strong drought tolerance. Avoid over-fertilizing, especially with nitrogen, as it is adapted to lean soils and fixes its own nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. As a nitrogen-fixing plant, it can be harmed by high-nitrogen formulas. If needed, a very low-phosphorus, slow-release formula for native plants can be used sparingly.
