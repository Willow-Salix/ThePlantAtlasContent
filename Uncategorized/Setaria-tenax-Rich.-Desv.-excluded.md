## Introduction
Setaria is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family. The name is derived from the Latin word seta, meaning "bristle" or "hair", which refers to the bristly spikelets.
The genus includes over 100 species distributed in many tropical and temperate regions around the world, and members are commonly known as foxtail or bristle grasses.

## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native tropical grasslands and savannas. It requires moderate watering during its active growth period but exhibits good drought tolerance once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to less fertile soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season, but it is not a heavy feeder.
