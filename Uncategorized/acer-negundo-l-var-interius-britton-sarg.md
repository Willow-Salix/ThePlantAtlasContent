## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Boxelder thrives in temperate regions with full sun to partial shade, favoring consistently moist soil conditions mimicking its native riparian habitats. It is adaptable to various soil types and moderate fertility, though regular watering is key, especially during establishment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from average soil fertility. Generally not a heavy feeder, but a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can support growth in nutrient-poor soils.
