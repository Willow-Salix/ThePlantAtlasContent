## 🌱 Overview
Keckiella is a genus of plants in the plantain family. It includes several species of plants known commonly as keckiellas. A few species may be called beardtongues or penstemons because all keckiellas once belonged to genus Penstemon as the section Hesperothamnus. Keckiellas are native to the American southwest, especially California. They bloom in attractive snapdragon-like flowers. Genus Keckiella was named after the American botanist David D. Keck.
Species:

Keckiella antirrhinoides - snapdragon penstemon, yellow bush snapdragon
Keckiella breviflora - bush beardtongue, gaping beardtongue
Keckiella cordifolia - heartleaf keckiella, climbing penstemon
Keckiella corymbosa - redwood keckiella
Keckiella lemmonii - Lemmon's keckiella
Keckiella rothrockii - Rothrock's keckiella, Rothrock's penstemon
Keckiella ternata - scarlet keckiella

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native is adapted to Mediterranean climates, requiring full sun and excellent drainage. It is drought-tolerant, needing moderate water during cooler growing seasons and minimal water during hot, dry summers when it may go dormant. Avoid over-fertilization to mimic its natural, nutrient-poor habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in lean, well-draining soils and generally requires little to no supplemental fertilizer. If growth seems weak, a very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in early spring.
