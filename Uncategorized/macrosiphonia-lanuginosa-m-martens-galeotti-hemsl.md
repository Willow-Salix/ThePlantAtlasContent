## 🧤 Care Instructions
Macrosiphonia Lanuginosa thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical dry forests of Mexico and Guatemala. Provide full to partial sun exposure and allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings to accommodate natural drought periods. Fertilize lightly during its active growth phase in spring and summer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding once a month during the active growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer; no fertilizer during dormancy.
