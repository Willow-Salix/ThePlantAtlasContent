## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern Asia (including Siberia and Chukotka Peninsula) and Alaska, USA |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun in cool, high-altitude climates where intense heat is absent; partial shade in warmer lowland regions to protect from scorching afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture in very well-drained soil, especially during the active growing season, mimicking meltwater from snow; avoid any waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
To care for Manyflower Saxifrage, provide cool conditions with full sun or partial shade, ensuring the soil is consistently moist but exceedingly well-drained. Mimic its native alpine habitat by avoiding excessive heat and rich fertilizers, favoring lean, rocky substrates to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; this plant naturally thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils, so over-fertilization can be detrimental to its health.
