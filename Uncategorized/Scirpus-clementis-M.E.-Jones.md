## Introduction
Schoenoplectus acutus (syn. Scirpus acutus, Schoenoplectus lacustris, Scirpus lacustris  subsp. acutus),  called tule , common tule, hardstem tule, tule rush, hardstem bulrush, or viscid bulrush, is a giant species of sedge in the plant family Cyperaceae, native to freshwater marshes all over North America. The common name derives from the Nāhuatl word tōllin [ˈtoːlːin], and it was first recognized by the early Spanish explorers and missionaries in New Spain who saw the marsh plants in the Central Valley of California as similar to those in the marshes around Mexico City being used to construct shelters by the indigenous inhabitants.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet or submerged conditions, making it ideal for pond margins or bog gardens. It is a resilient species that generally needs low to moderate fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced slow-release aquatic fertilizer during the growing season can be beneficial, but often thrives without heavy feeding in suitable aquatic environments.
