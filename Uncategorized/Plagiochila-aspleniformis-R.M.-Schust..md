## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Neotropical montane rainforests, including Central and South America and the Caribbean |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Rainforest / Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light. Thrives in deep shade or highly filtered light, mimicking its understory/cloud forest habitat. Direct sun is harmful. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and constant moisture. Substrate should always be damp but well-drained. Frequent misting is beneficial; avoid drying out. |

## Introduction
Plagiochila is a large, common, and widespread genus of liverworts in the order Jungermanniales. It is a member of the family  Plagiochilaceae within that order. There may be anywhere from 500 to 1300 species, most of them from the tropics; the exact number is still under revision.

## Care Guide
This liverwort demands a perpetually humid and moist environment with very low light, mimicking its native cloud forest habitat. Ensure consistent moisture in the substrate and high ambient humidity, avoiding direct sunlight and excessive fertilization to thrive.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Bryophytes are adapted to nutrient-poor environments. If fertilized, use a highly diluted liquid solution very sparingly.
