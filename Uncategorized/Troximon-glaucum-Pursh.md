# Glaucous Hawksbeard

*Troximon glaucum Pursh* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western and Central North America (from Alaska and British Columbia south to California and east to the Great Plains) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland, Montane, and Open Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun to partial sun, typical of open prairies, meadows, and dry slopes. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; prefers well-drained soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, mimicking natural rainfall patterns in its native habitat. |

## Care Guide
This resilient perennial prefers full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its origins in open, often dry North American landscapes. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for appropriate climates.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. Native to areas with average to poor soils, so heavy fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, if at all, is sufficient.
