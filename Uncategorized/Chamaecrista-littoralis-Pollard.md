## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida), Bahamas, Cuba |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Coastal Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright direct light (at least 6 hours daily) to mimic its exposed coastal habitat. |
| **Watering** | Prefers well-draining soil; allow the top few inches to dry out completely between waterings. Drought tolerant once established but benefits from occasional watering during prolonged dry periods. |

## Introduction
Chamaecrista is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Members of the genus are commonly known as sensitive pea. Several species are capable of rapid plant movement. Unlike the related genera Cassia and Senna, members of Chamaecrista form root nodules.
Chamaecrista has 367 species, with a wide distribution – the Americas from Minnesota to northern Argentina, sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Iran, the Indian Subcontinent, Indochina, China, Korea, Japan, Malesia, New Guinea, and Australia.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and very well-draining, sandy soils, reflecting its native coastal scrubland habitat. It is highly drought tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering, and has minimal fertilizer needs due to its ability to fix nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly in very poor soils if growth is lagging.
