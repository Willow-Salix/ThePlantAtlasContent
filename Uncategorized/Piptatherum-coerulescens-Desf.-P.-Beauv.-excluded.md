## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean habitat. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, especially during summer. Minimal to no fertilization is needed for optimal growth in most conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils. Minimal fertilization, if any, is sufficient.
