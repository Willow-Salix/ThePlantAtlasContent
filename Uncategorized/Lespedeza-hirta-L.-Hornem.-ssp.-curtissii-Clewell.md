## Introduction
Lespedeza is a genus of some 45 species (including nothospecies) of flowering plants in the pea family (Fabaceae), commonly known as bush clovers or (particularly East Asian species) Japanese clovers (hagi). The genus is native to warm temperate to subtropical regions of eastern North America, eastern and southern Asia and Australasia.
These shrubby plants or trailing vines belong to the "typical" legumes (Faboideae), with the peas and beans, though they are part of another tribe, the Desmodieae. Therein, they are treated as type genus of the smaller subtribe Lespedezinae, which unites the present genus and its presumed closest relatives, Campylotropis and Kummerowia.

## Care Guide
Curtiss' Lespedeza thrives in the humid subtropical woodland climate of the southeastern U.S., preferring full sun to partial shade and well-drained soils. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it a low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume (Fabaceae family), it fixes nitrogen and generally does not require heavy fertilization, especially on poor to moderately fertile soils.
