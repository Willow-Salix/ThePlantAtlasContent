## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Pacific Northwest including British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, northern California, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coniferous Forest (cool, humid, shaded) |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade. Thrives in deep shade, avoid direct sunlight which can scorch fronds. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture. Keep soil continuously damp but not waterlogged, mimicking its native habitat along stream banks and in moist ravines. Benefits from high humidity. |

## Introduction
Polystichum is a genus of ferns in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). The genus has about 500 species and has a cosmopolitan distribution. The highest diversity is in eastern Asia, with about 208 species in China alone; the region from Mexico to Brazil has at least 100 additional species; Africa (at least 17 species), North America (at least 18 species), and Europe (at least 5 species) have much lower diversity. Polystichum species are terrestrial or rock-dwelling ferns of warm-temperate and montane-tropical regions (a few species grow in alpine regions). They are often found in disturbed habitats such as road cuts, talus slopes, and stream banks.

## Care Guide
This fern thrives in cool, humid conditions with consistent moisture and low light, mimicking its native forest floor environment. Provide well-draining, organically rich soil and protect it from direct sun to ensure lush growth. Fertilize sparingly, preferring organic amendments.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization. Benefits from a weak, balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring/early summer) or an annual application of compost/leaf mold to enrich the soil.
