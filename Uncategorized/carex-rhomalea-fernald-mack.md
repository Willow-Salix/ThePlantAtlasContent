Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This woodland sedge thrives in the cool, moist conditions of its native understory. Provide consistently moist, well-draining soil in partial to full shade, and enrich with organic matter to mimic its natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from annual enrichment with organic matter or a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring.
