## Care Guide
Purple Mullein flourishes in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its origins in temperate grasslands and steppes. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, along with very low fertilizer application.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth.
