## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (including southwestern United States, parts of Mexico, and British Columbia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland, Shrubland, and Riparian Zones |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) for best flowering and growth, tolerating some partial afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to regular watering, preferring consistently moist but well-drained soil. It is tolerant of short periods of drought once established, especially in its native range, but benefits from more consistent moisture in cultivation. |

## Introduction
Oenothera elata is a species of Oenothera known by the common name Hooker's evening primrose or tall evening primrose. Subspecies include hookeri, hirsutissima, longisima, jamesii, villosa and elata. It is native to much of western and central North America. The plants are quite tall, especially the hookeri subspecies, native to California, which can reach about 1.8 meters (6 feet) height.  The plants are found along roadsides, in moist meadows, or in woodland, from sea level up to 9,000 ft (2,700 m) in elevation.

## Care Guide
Hooker's Evening Primrose is a resilient plant thriving in full sun and requiring moderate, consistent watering in well-drained soil. Hailing from temperate and riparian zones, it is not particularly demanding regarding soil fertility and can tolerate some drought. Avoid over-fertilizing to prevent excessive leafy growth at the expense of flowers.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant is adapted to average to poor soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. An annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth appears weak.
