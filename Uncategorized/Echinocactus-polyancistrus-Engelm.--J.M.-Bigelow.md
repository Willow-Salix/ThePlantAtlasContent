## Introduction
Echinocactus is a genus of cacti in the subfamily Cactoideae. The generic name derives from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echînos), meaning "spiny," and cactus.  It and Ferocactus are the two genera of barrel cactus.  Members of the genus usually have heavy spination and relatively small flowers.  The fruits are copiously woolly, and this is one major distinction between Echinocactus and Ferocactus.  Propagation is by seed.

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives on neglect, mimicking its native arid environment. Provide maximum sunlight exposure, extremely infrequent watering, and ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Minimal fertilization is required.

### Fertilizer
Very low; apply a diluted, balanced cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
