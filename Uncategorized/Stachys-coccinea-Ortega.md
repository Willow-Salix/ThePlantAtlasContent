## Care Guide
The Scarlet Hedgenettle thrives in full sun to partial shade, particularly appreciating afternoon shade in hotter climates. It requires consistent moisture, similar to its native riparian and woodland habitats, so water regularly, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions. Fertilize lightly during the growing season to support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer).
