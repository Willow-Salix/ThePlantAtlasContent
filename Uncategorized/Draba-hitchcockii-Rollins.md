## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lost River Draba thrives in conditions mimicking its native alpine habitat. Provide full sun and ensure excellent drainage with rocky or gritty soil, allowing it to dry between waterings. Fertilization is rarely needed as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky alpine soils. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, with a highly diluted, balanced fertilizer during the active growth period.
