## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East-central Idaho, USA (Lost River and Lemhi Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers bright, unobstructed light, similar to its high-elevation native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires excellent drainage, tolerating periods of drought but benefiting from consistent moisture during its short growing season. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Lost River Draba thrives in conditions mimicking its native alpine habitat. Provide full sun and ensure excellent drainage with rocky or gritty soil, allowing it to dry between waterings. Fertilization is rarely needed as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky alpine soils. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, with a highly diluted, balanced fertilizer during the active growth period.
