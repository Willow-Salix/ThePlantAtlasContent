## Care Guide
Terminalia chebula thrives in warm, humid conditions during its active growth phase, requiring full sun and consistent watering. During the dry season, it needs significantly less water and can tolerate drought conditions. Provide a moderate, balanced fertilizer during periods of active growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, balanced fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer) to support vigorous growth. Reduce or cease fertilization during the dormant period.
