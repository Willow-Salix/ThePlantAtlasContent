## Care Guide
Skyttea is a genus of lichenicolous fungi that lives on other lichens, meaning its 'care' is entirely dependent on the health and specific environmental conditions of its host. It indirectly thrives in cool, humid environments with adequate atmospheric moisture, as it derives all necessary nutrients directly from its host lichen.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; obtains all necessary nutrients directly from its host lichen. No external fertilization is required or beneficial.
