## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Vernal Pool Ecosystem |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, as it grows in open, unshaded vernal pools. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent and heavy watering during its active growth period from winter through late spring to simulate its vernal pool habitat, followed by a completely dry dormancy in summer. |

## Introduction
Navarretia is a genus of flowering plants related to the phloxes and the gilias. This is one genus of plants, among others, which are sometimes called pincushion plants. It includes 45 species native to the Americas. In North America they range from western Canada through the western and west-central United States to northwestern Mexico, and to Ohio and Pennsylvania. In South America they range through Argentina and Chile.
The inflorescence which bears the flowers is surrounded by frilly green bracts bearing soft spines, giving it the appearance of a pincushion. Several species are members of the vernal pool ecosystem.

## Care Guide
This annual plant thrives with full sun exposure and requires abundant water during its winter-spring growing period to emulate its native vernal pool environment. A subsequent dry summer dormancy is crucial. Utilize low to moderate fertilization during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, primarily during the active growth phase. Over-fertilizing can be detrimental.
