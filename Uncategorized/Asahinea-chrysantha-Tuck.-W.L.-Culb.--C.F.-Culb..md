## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Boreal regions, including Alaska, Canada, Northern Europe (Scandinavia), Russia, and Northern Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra / Boreal Forest margins |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun, avoiding intense direct heat. It thrives in open, exposed environments common to high latitudes and altitudes. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent humidity and moisture from rain or fog, with excellent air circulation to prevent prolonged wetness. Mimic natural cycles of wetting and drying rather than continuous saturation. |

## Introduction
Asahinea is a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. The genus has a widespread circumpolar distribution, and contains three species. The genus was circumscribed by the husband and wife lichenologist team William and Chicita F. Culberson in 1965, with Asahinea chrysantha as the type species. The genus name honours Japanese lichenologist Yasuhiko Asahina.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, bright, and humid conditions characteristic of its native alpine and arctic habitats. Provide ample air circulation and avoid high temperatures or direct, scorching sun. No traditional fertilization is needed, as it absorbs nutrients from the air and moisture.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required or beneficial. Lichens absorb nutrients directly from the atmosphere and rainwater, and are sensitive to excess nutrients and pollutants.
