## 🧤 Care Instructions
Herre's Dimple Lichen thrives in cool, highly humid conditions with indirect light, replicating its native temperate forest floor habitat. Maintaining high ambient humidity through regular misting or a humid enclosure is paramount, as is avoiding any direct sunlight. Fertilization is entirely unnecessary and should be avoided.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens are self-sufficient in obtaining nutrients from the air and rain, and supplemental fertilization can be harmful.
