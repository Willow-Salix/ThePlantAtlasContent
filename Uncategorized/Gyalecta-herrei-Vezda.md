| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforest / Temperate Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate, indirect light or dappled shade. Avoid direct, harsh sun. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity is crucial. Requires consistent moisture from misting or a humid environment; it absorbs water through its surface and not via roots in soil. |

## Care Guide
Herre's Dimple Lichen thrives in cool, highly humid conditions with indirect light, replicating its native temperate forest floor habitat. Maintaining high ambient humidity through regular misting or a humid enclosure is paramount, as is avoiding any direct sunlight. Fertilization is entirely unnecessary and should be avoided.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens are self-sufficient in obtaining nutrients from the air and rain, and supplemental fertilization can be harmful.
