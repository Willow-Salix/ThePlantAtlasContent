## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Puerto Rico |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light; avoid direct sunlight, especially midday sun, as it naturally grows in the understory or shrouded by fog. |
| **Watering** | High and consistent moisture. Keep substrate evenly moist but not waterlogged. Requires very high atmospheric humidity (70-90%) and benefits from frequent misting or a terrarium environment. |

## Introduction
Huperzia is a genus of lycophyte plants, sometimes known as the firmosses or fir clubmosses; the Flora of North America calls them gemma fir-mosses. This genus was originally included in the related genus Lycopodium, from which it differs in having undifferentiated sporangial leaves, and the sporangia not formed into apical cones.  The common name firmoss, used for some of the north temperate species, refers to their superficial resemblance to branches of fir (Abies), a conifer. As of 2020, two very different circumscriptions of the genus were in use. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Huperzia is one of three genera in the subfamily Huperzioideae of the family Lycopodiaceae. Most species in the subfamily are placed in the genus Phlegmariurus. Huperzia is left with about 25 species, although not all have been formally transferred to other genera. Other sources recognize only Huperzia, which then has about 340 species.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic clubmoss thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical montane cloud forest, requiring consistently high humidity and bright indirect light. Maintain constant moisture without waterlogging, and provide light fertilization to support its growth as it derives nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization. Use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) once a month during active growth. As an epiphyte, it does not require rich soil.
