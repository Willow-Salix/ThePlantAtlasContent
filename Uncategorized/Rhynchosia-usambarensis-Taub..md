## Introduction
Rhynchosia, also known as snoutbean, is a genus of plants in the family Fabaceae. It includes 260 species of herbs, vines, and subshrubs native to tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions around the world, ranging from the southern United States to northern Argentina in the Americas, and through Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, southern Asia from Iran to Korea and Japan, New Guinea, and Australia. Typical habitats include seasonally-dry forest, forest margins, woodland, thicket, wooded grassland, shrubland, and grassland, often in open rocky areas, disturbed areas, or along streams. Many species are pyrophytes. There are several different complexes within the genus, including the Senna complex.

## Care Guide
This East African native thrives in bright, sunny conditions, characteristic of tropical savannas. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and provide light fertilization during active growth. Its adaptation to dry seasons makes it relatively drought-tolerant and low-maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, diluted fertilizer during the growing season. As a legume, it has lower nitrogen requirements due to nitrogen fixation.
