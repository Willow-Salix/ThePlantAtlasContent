## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (primarily mountainous regions such as the Rocky Mountains and Appalachians) |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Tundra, Temperate Montane zones (rocky habitats) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright indirect light; typically found on exposed rock surfaces |
| **Watering** | Relies on infrequent natural rainfall, snowmelt, and atmospheric moisture (dew/fog); highly tolerant of dry periods |

## Introduction
Rhizocarpon is a genus of crustose, saxicolous (or sometimes lichenicolous), lecideoid lichens in the family Rhizocarpaceae. The genus is common in arctic-alpine environments, but also occurs throughout temperate, subtropical, and even tropical regions. They are commonly known as map lichens because of the prothallus forming border-like bands between colonies in some species, like the common map lichen (Rhizocarpon geographicum).

## Care Guide
As a rock-dwelling lichen, Rhizocarpon albineum requires a cool, well-ventilated environment with strong light exposure on an inert, non-calcareous rock substrate. It thrives on natural atmospheric moisture from rain and dew, tolerating prolonged dry periods, and requires no traditional watering or fertilization.

### Fertilizer
None; obtains necessary nutrients from atmospheric dust and minerals leached from the rock substrate
