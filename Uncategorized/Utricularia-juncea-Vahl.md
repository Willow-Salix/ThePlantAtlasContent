## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States, Central America, Caribbean, and northern South America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Wetlands and Bogs |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, direct sunlight for several hours daily to dappled partial shade. Avoid deep shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Constantly wet to fully submerged in shallow water; the substrate must never dry out. Use only distilled, reverse osmosis, or rainwater due to sensitivity to minerals. |

## 🌱 Overview
Utricularia, commonly and collectively called the bladderworts, is a genus of carnivorous plants consisting of approximately 233 species (precise counts differ based on classification opinions; a 2001 publication lists 215 species). They occur in freshwater and wet soil as terrestrial or aquatic species across every continent except Antarctica. Utricularia are cultivated for their flowers, which are often compared with those of snapdragons and orchids, especially amongst carnivorous plant enthusiasts.
All Utricularia are carnivorous and capture small organisms by means of bladder-like traps. Terrestrial species tend to have tiny traps that feed on minute prey such as protozoa and rotifers swimming in water-saturated soil. The traps can range in size from 0.02 to 1.2 cm (0.008 to 0.5 in). Aquatic species, such as U. vulgaris (common bladderwort), possess bladders that are usually larger and can feed on more substantial prey such as water fleas (Daphnia), nematodes and even fish fry, mosquito larvae and young tadpoles. Despite their small size, the traps are extremely sophisticated. In the active traps of the aquatic species, prey brush against trigger hairs connected to the trapdoor. The bladder, when "set", is under negative pressure in relation to its environment so that when the trapdoor is mechanically triggered, the prey, along with the water surrounding it, is sucked into the bladder. Once the bladder is full of water, the door closes again, the whole process taking only ten to fifteen milliseconds.
Bladderworts are unusual and highly specialized plants, and the vegetative organs are not clearly separated into roots, leaves, and stems as in most other angiosperms.  Utricularia lack a root system.
Bladder traps  are recognized as one of the most sophisticated structures in the plant kingdom.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Southern Bladderwort requires consistently wet, nutrient-poor conditions with bright light, mirroring its native subtropical wetland habitat. Always use pure water like distilled or rainwater, and never fertilize through the roots, as it obtains nutrients from its prey.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is needed through the roots, as it is a carnivorous plant adapted to nutrient-poor environments. It captures its own nutrients from small aquatic organisms.
