## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean.

## Care Guide
Wenatchee Mountains Lupine thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean to poor soils, reflecting its dry montane origins. Water infrequently once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid any heavy fertilization, particularly with nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, especially nitrogen, as it is a nitrogen-fixing legume and thrives in poor to moderately fertile soil.
