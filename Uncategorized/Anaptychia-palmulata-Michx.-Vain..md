## Introduction
Anaptychia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. Anaptychia species are foliose (leafy) to fruticose (bushy) lichens. They have brown, thin-walled spores with a single septum, and a prosoplechtenchymatous upper cortex.

## Care Guide
Fringed Lichen thrives in environments with high atmospheric humidity and bright indirect light to partial shade, characteristic of moist temperate forests. It requires consistent moisture from mist or rain, allowing for drying periods, and is extremely sensitive to any fertilizers or pollution, making a clean, humid environment paramount for its health.

### Fertilizer
None; extremely sensitive to any form of fertilizer or atmospheric pollution, deriving all necessary nutrients from the air and host substrate.
