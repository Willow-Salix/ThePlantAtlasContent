## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical South America (e.g., Brazil, French Guiana) and parts of tropical Asia |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Very low to low light; prefers indirect or dappled shade, avoiding any direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Extremely high and consistent humidity is crucial. This lichen absorbs moisture from the air, requiring frequent misting or a high-humidity environment like a terrarium. It should never be allowed to dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Opegrapha is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Opegraphaceae. These lichens form crusty patches on bark, rock, or other lichens, and are easily recognized by their distinctive black, slit-like or rounded fruiting bodies that look like tiny scribbles or dashes on the surface. The genus includes more than 100 species found worldwide, with most partnering with orange-pigmented green algae, though some live as parasites on other lichens.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest habitat. Provide very low, indirect light and extremely high, consistent humidity. No traditional fertilization is needed, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the environment.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens derive necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate.
