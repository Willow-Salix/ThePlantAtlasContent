## Care Guide
This tropical plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate to frequent watering during its active growth, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Regular, but not excessive, fertilization in warm months will support its robust growth, mimicking its native habitat in disturbed, open areas of Southeast Asia.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (warm months). Less frequent or no fertilizer during dormant periods.
