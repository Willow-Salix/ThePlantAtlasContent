## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate and boreal regions of North America and Europe |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun, mimicking its growth on sun-exposed or semi-shaded dead wood. |
| **Watering** | Requires high ambient humidity and occasional misting; it absorbs moisture directly from the air and rain, not through roots. Avoid traditional soil-based watering. |

## Care Guide
Soot Lichen thrives in bright indirect to partial sun conditions, replicating its natural habitat on sun-exposed deadwood in temperate and boreal forests. It requires high ambient humidity and occasional misting for moisture absorption, rather than traditional watering. No specific fertilization is needed for its growth.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required, as lichens obtain necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and their substrate.
