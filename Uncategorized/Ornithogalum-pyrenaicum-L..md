## Introduction
Ornithogalum is a genus  of perennial plants mostly native to southern Europe and southern Africa belonging to the family Asparagaceae. Some species are native to other areas such as the Caucasus. Some species are classified as noxious invasive weeds in some portions of North America. Growing from a bulb, species have linear basal leaves and a slender stalk, up to 30 cm tall, bearing clusters of typically white star-shaped flowers, often striped with green. The common name of the genus, star-of-Bethlehem, is based on its star-shaped flowers, after the Star of Bethlehem that appears in the biblical account of the birth of Jesus. The number of species has varied considerably, depending on authority, from 50 to 300.

## Care Guide
Pyrenees Star of Bethlehem flourishes in full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native temperate grassland and woodland edge habitats. Provide regular water during its spring growth, then allow it to dry out as it enters summer dormancy. A light spring fertilization supports healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in early spring as new growth emerges, especially if the soil is poor.
