## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East and Southeast Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Sikkim, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Temperate Montane Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Full Shade to Very Low Light (as a mycoheterotrophic plant, it does not require direct sunlight for photosynthesis) |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained substrate, mimicking the high humidity and regular rainfall of its native forest floor habitat. |

## Introduction
Neottia is a genus of orchids. The genus now includes the former genus Listera,  commonly known as twayblades, referring to the single pair of  opposite leaves at the base of the flowering stem. The genus is native to temperate, subarctic and arctic regions across most of Europe, northern Asia (Siberia, China, the Himalayas, Central Asia, etc), and North America, with a few species extending into subtropical regions in the Mediterranean, Indochina, the southeastern United States, etc.
Neottia produces a racemose inflorescences with flowers in shades of green or dull pink through to  maroon and purple. The lip of each flower is prominently forked or two-lobed. Some species (those which were previously the only members of the genus Neottia in the strict sense, such as the bird's-nest orchid, Neottia nidus-avis) are completely without chlorophyll and have leaves which are reduced to scales.

## Care Guide
This mycoheterotrophic orchid requires a habitat of full shade to very low light, mirroring its native forest floor environment. It needs a consistently moist, well-drained, and organically rich substrate to support its essential fungal partners, as it derives all nutrients from this unique symbiotic relationship, making traditional fertilization unnecessary and potentially harmful.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed; this plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it obtains all nutrients from fungi associated with decaying organic matter, rather than directly from soil or external fertilizers.
