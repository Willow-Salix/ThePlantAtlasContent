## Introduction
Aureolaria, with the common name false foxgloves, is a genus of 8 species, native to North America.
Aureolaria plants are hemiparasitic, which is a character that in part describes the family Orobanchaceae.
Until recently the genus was aligned with members of the family Scrophulariaceae.  As a result of numerous molecular phylogenetic studies based on various chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) loci, it was shown to be more closely related to members of the Orobanchaceae.

## Care Guide
Thriving in temperate woodlands, this plant prefers partial to full sun and moist, well-drained soil. As a hemiparasite, it needs minimal fertilization and benefits from the presence of compatible host plants, adapting well to average soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a hemiparasitic plant, it derives nutrients from host plants (often oaks) and does not require rich soils or heavy fertilization. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
