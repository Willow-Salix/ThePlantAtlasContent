## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern California and Southwestern Oregon, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun, tolerating partial afternoon shade in hotter climates. Requires ample sunlight for robust growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular watering during its active growth period in winter and spring, simulating native rainfall. It needs a completely dry summer dormancy period, with no water when the foliage dies back. |

## Introduction
Brodiaea , also known by the common name cluster-lilies, is a monocot genus of flowering plants.
One school of thought places the genus in the family Themidaceae, while another school of thought places it in the subfamily Brodiaeoideae of the family Asparagaceae.  The USDA Plants Database still classifies the genus Brodiaea in the family Liliaceae.
Brodiaea species occur along the Pacific Coast region of North America, from British Columbia throughout California into the Baja California Peninsula. They are especially common in northern California.

## Care Guide
This plant flourishes in full sun with well-draining soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean climate. Provide consistent moisture during its winter-spring growth cycle, followed by a critical dry dormancy through summer. Fertilize sparingly during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer during the active growth phase (late winter/early spring) is usually sufficient, as it's adapted to relatively lean soils.
