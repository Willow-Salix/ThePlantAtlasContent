## Introduction
Lygodesmia, called skeletonplant, is a genus of North American flowering plants in the tribe Cichorieae within the family Asteraceae.
The name derives from the Greek lygos, a pliant twig, and desme, a bundle, because of the fascicled twiggy or rush-like stems of the plants.

## Care Guide
The Skeletonplant thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid environments, requiring full sun and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant, so water sparingly and only when the soil is completely dry to avoid root rot. Minimal to no fertilization is needed as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor soils and generally does not require regular fertilization. If necessary, use a very diluted, balanced fertilizer sparingly in spring.
