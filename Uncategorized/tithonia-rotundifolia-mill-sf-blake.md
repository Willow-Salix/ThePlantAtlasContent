## 🌱 Overview
Tithonia is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Heliantheae within the family Asteraceae.
Tithonia has a center of distribution in Mexico but with one species extending into the Southwestern United States and several native to Central America.  Two species, T. diversifolia and T. rotundifolia, are widely cultivated and have escaped to become weeds in tropical and subtropical areas around the world. T. rotundifolia makes a nice fresh cut flower, flowering in mid- to late-summer in the Northern hemisphere. The distinguishing feature of the genus is the peduncle, which is fistulose (meaning hollow and flaring toward the apex).  The plants are coarse annual or perennial herbs or shrubs, and one species, T. koelzii, is a small tree.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mexican Sunflower thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring warm climates similar to its native Mexico and Central America. It requires moderate watering during its active growth period but tolerates some drought once established. Fertilization is generally low, as it can flourish in average to poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; can thrive in average to poor soils. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth at the expense of blooms.
