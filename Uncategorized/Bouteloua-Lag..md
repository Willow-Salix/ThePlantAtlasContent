## Care Guide
Grama grasses, native to open, dry grasslands, thrive in full sun and are highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established. They prefer well-draining soils and do not necessitate frequent or heavy fertilization. This makes them an excellent low-maintenance choice for sunny, arid, or semi-arid landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to lean soils and typically does not require heavy fertilization, a light annual application in spring is usually sufficient.
