## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Rocky Mountain region (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, Utah in USA). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cold Desert / Arid Scrubland and Subalpine Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflective of its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Its native environment experiences limited and sporadic rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Haplopappus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae found in South America, mostly restricted to the dry regions of the Southern Andes, Chilean Matorral, and Patagonia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun with excellent drainage, mimicking its native arid and subalpine environments. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, preferring deep, infrequent hydration. Fertilizer needs are very low, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny locations.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Native soils in arid and subalpine regions are typically lean. A very light, balanced granular fertilizer application in spring might be beneficial in extremely poor soils, but generally not necessary.
