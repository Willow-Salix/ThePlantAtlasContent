## Care Guide
Loeskypnum moss requires a cool, constantly moist environment with high humidity, mimicking its native bog and fen habitats. Provide partial to full shade and ensure its substrate never dries out, avoiding any significant fertilization as it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
None to very low; prefers nutrient-poor, acidic environments and will likely suffer from high fertilizer concentrations.
