## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (specifically Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, Hawaii) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Wet Forest / Mesic Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright indirect light to partial shade, mimicking its native habitat beneath a forest canopy or in dappled shrublands. Avoid intense, direct midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist but well-drained soil, reflecting the frequent rainfall and high humidity of its native environment. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, but also prevent waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native thrives in conditions replicating its tropical montane wet forest home, meaning consistent moisture, high humidity, and dappled light. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained. Fertilize moderately during growth periods to support its needs.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a moderate, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly (e.g., half-strength every 4-6 weeks) during its active growing season to support robust growth without over-enriching the soil.
