| **Climate** | Temperate Oceanic (e.g., Atlantic European heath and forest biomes) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Prefers sheltered locations with good air circulation, avoiding harsh, direct sun that could lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires high ambient humidity and frequent moisture from rainfall or dew. Tolerates dry periods but thrives with consistent atmospheric moisture absorption. |

## Care Guide
This crustose lichen thrives in humid, temperate oceanic climates, typically on the bark of old deciduous trees. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and ensure consistent high humidity with access to clean air. Conventional watering or fertilization methods are not applicable, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the environment.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable for conventional fertilization. Nutrients are absorbed from atmospheric deposition and rainfall, along with the organic matter on its substrate.
