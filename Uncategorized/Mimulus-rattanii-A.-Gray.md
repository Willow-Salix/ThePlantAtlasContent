## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in consistently moist soil conditions, mimicking its native habitat along streams and seeps. Provide partial to full sun exposure, ensuring adequate water to prevent drying out. Fertilization needs are low to moderate, supporting its natural growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer once or twice during the growing season should suffice, or none if soil is already rich.
