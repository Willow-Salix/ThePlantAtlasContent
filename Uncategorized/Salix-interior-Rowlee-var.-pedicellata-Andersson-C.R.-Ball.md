## Care Guide
This willow thrives in full sun and consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native riparian habitat. It is a robust plant that doesn't demand extensive fertilization, especially once established. Ensure adequate water to prevent stress, particularly in drier periods.

### Fertilizer
Generally low to moderate. In rich riparian soils, little to no supplemental fertilizer may be needed. For less fertile sites, a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial for young plants.
