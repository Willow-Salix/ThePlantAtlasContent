## Care Guide
Leatherleaf requires consistently wet, acidic soil, mimicking its native bog environment. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and needs minimal to no fertilizer due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils. Ensure the soil never dries out to maintain optimal health.

### Fertilizer
