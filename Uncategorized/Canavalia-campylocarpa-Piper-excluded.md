The species of Canavalia endemic to the Hawaiian Islands were named ʻāwikiwiki by the Native Hawaiians. The name translates to "the very quick one" and comes from the Hawaiian word for "fast". The genus name is derived from the Malabar word for the species, kavavali, which means "forest climber".

## Care Guide
This vining plant thrives in tropical conditions, requiring abundant sunlight and consistent moisture with superior drainage. As a nitrogen-fixer, its fertilization needs are moderate. Protect from cold temperatures, as it is sensitive to frost.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, reducing the need for high nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced or phosphorus/potassium-rich fertilizer can be applied during active growth periods.
