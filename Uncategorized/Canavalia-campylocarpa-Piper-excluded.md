## 🧤 Care Instructions
This vining plant thrives in tropical conditions, requiring abundant sunlight and consistent moisture with superior drainage. As a nitrogen-fixer, its fertilization needs are moderate. Protect from cold temperatures, as it is sensitive to frost.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, reducing the need for high nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced or phosphorus/potassium-rich fertilizer can be applied during active growth periods.
