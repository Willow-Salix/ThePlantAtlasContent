## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America (e.g., Appalachian Mountains, Pacific Northwest), and East Asia (e.g., Japan). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Forests, Montane Forests, and Boreal Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low to indirect light; requires constant deep shade, mimicking its growth under dense forest canopies or in shaded crevices. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist (but not waterlogged) substrate and very high ambient humidity (90%+ is ideal). Frequent misting or cultivation in a terrarium/paludarium environment is essential to prevent desiccation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bazzania is a genus of liverwort in the family Lepidoziaceae. The name Bazzania is in honour of Matteo Bazzani (1674–1749), an Italian botanist and professor of Anatomy from the University of Bologna.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort thrives in consistently cool, shaded, and exceptionally humid environments, mimicking its native forest floor habitat. Maintain a constantly moist substrate and very high atmospheric humidity, while providing minimal light and virtually no fertilization to ensure optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low. Bryophytes derive most nutrients from dissolved minerals in water and decaying organic matter. A highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer applied once or twice a year, or none at all, is generally sufficient.
