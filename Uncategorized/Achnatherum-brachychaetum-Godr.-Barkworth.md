| **Native Origin** | South America (Argentina, Uruguay, Southern Brazil) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (prefers full sun for best growth) |
| **Watering** | Moderate, allowing soil to dry out between waterings; drought-tolerant once established. |

## Introduction
Achnatherum is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It includes 20 species of needlegrass native to temperate Eurasia and North Africa. Several needlegrass species have been switched between Achnatherum and genus Stipa; taxonomy between the two closely related genera is still uncertain. In 2019 Peterson et al. reorganized the genera in tribe Stipeae based on molecular DNA studies, and placed the species from the Americas into other genera.

## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native temperate grasslands. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and is notably drought-tolerant once established. Fertilizer needs are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to less nutrient-rich environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light, balanced fertilizer in spring if soil is poor or growth is lacking.
