## Care Guide
This Evening Primrose variety thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native arid scrubland habitat. It requires very infrequent watering, being highly drought-tolerant, and has minimal fertilizer needs. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor desert soils.
