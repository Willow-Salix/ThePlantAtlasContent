# Pseudoditrichum Moss

*Pseudoditrichum Steere & Z. Iwats.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Subarctic regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Arctic Canada, Greenland), Europe (e.g., Svalbard), and Asia (e.g., Siberia, Hokkaido, Japan), including high-altitude alpine zones. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra, Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Can tolerate some low-angle direct morning or late afternoon sun, but intense midday sun should be avoided. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist substrate and high humidity. Water frequently to keep the growing medium damp but not waterlogged, ideally with soft water such as rainwater or distilled water. |

## Introduction
Pseudoditrichum is a rare North American genus of haplolepideous moss (Dicranidae). It is the only known genus in its family (Pseudoditrichaceae), and there is only one species in the genus. Pseudoditrichum mirabile has been found only in a small area along the Sloan River near Great Bear Lake. This is in the Northwest Territory in northern Canada, only a few kilometers south of the Arctic Circle.
Pseudoditrichum mirabile is unusual in that the combination of the gametophyte features and the sporophyte morphology do not match any other moss family. The entire plant is a mere 3 mm tall, growing on moist silt, generally underneath Populus. It spreads vegetatively by means of spherical underground tubers as well as via narrow, thread-like gemmae. Spores are 15-21 μm long, shed one at a time.

## Care Guide
Pseudoditrichum moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, high-humidity conditions mimicking its native arctic-alpine habitat. Provide bright, indirect light and maintain a damp substrate with soft water. Fertilization should be minimal, if any, due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a highly diluted (1/10th strength) balanced liquid fertilizer only during the active growing season. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
