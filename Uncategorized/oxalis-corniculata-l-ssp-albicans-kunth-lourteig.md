## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in bright, open conditions and prefers well-draining soil that is allowed to dry out between waterings. It is not a heavy feeder and adapts well to varying conditions, making it relatively low maintenance. Protect from prolonged periods of extreme heat and drought.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder; a diluted balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the active growing season is sufficient, or less if growing vigorously.
