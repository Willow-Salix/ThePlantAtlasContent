## 🧤 Care Instructions
Glaucous Barley is a resilient grass that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its Mediterranean origins. It requires moderate watering during active growth but is highly drought-tolerant once established, preferring dry periods between waterings. Minimal fertilization is generally sufficient for this adaptable plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Can thrive in poor soils; supplement sparingly with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer if growth appears weak.
