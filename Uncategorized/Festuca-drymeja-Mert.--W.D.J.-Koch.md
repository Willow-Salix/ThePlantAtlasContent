## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Southern Europe (e.g., Alps, Carpathians) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade, reflecting its natural habitat as an understory plant in mountain forests. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture; keep the soil evenly moist but ensure good drainage, mimicking regular forest precipitation. |

## Introduction
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## Care Guide
To care for Drymeja Fescue, provide cool temperatures and partial to full shade, mirroring its native montane forest environment. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil and offer moderate fertilization to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or incorporation of organic matter can mimic the nutrient richness of forest soils.
