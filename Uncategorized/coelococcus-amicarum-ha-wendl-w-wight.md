## 🌱 Overview
Metroxylon is a genus of monoecious flowering plants in the Arecaceae (palm) family, and commonly called the sago palms consisting of seven species. They are native to Western Samoa, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Moluccas, the Carolines and Fiji in a variety of habitats, and cultivated westward to Thailand and Malaya.
The name is a combination of two Greek words: metra meaning "womb", commonly translated as "heart" in this context, and xylon meaning "wood", in allusion to the large proportion of pith contained in the plant.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical palm flourishes in conditions reminiscent of its native Yap Island, requiring consistent warmth, high humidity, and abundant moisture. Provide full sun to partial shade with excellent drainage, and feed regularly during active growth to ensure a healthy plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high; regular feeding with a balanced, slow-release palm fertilizer during the growing season is recommended to support robust growth in its potentially nutrient-leached native soil.
