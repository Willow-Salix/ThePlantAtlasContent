## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in Arctic-Alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America (e.g., Western US, Canada), Europe (e.g., Alps, Scandinavia), and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic-Alpine |
| **Sunlight** | High direct sun exposure, tolerant of intense UV radiation, typical of open, treeless alpine environments at high altitudes or latitudes. |
| **Watering** | Requires intermittent moisture from rain, fog, or snowmelt, followed by periods of desiccation. Lichens absorb water directly from the environment and do not tolerate prolonged constant wetness. |

## Introduction
Porpidia is a genus of crustose lichens in the family Lecideaceae. Porpidia species primarily inhabit siliceous rocks, pebbles, and stonework, with rare occurrences on bark, wood, and compacted soil. The thallus, or body of the lichen, varies in appearance from thick and crusty to barely visible. It may form a continuous layer or develop cracks resulting in a segmented, areolate structure. The colour of the thallus ranges from grey and white to orange.

## Care Guide
This saxicolous (rock-dwelling) lichen thrives in harsh alpine conditions, requiring significant direct sunlight and tolerance for strong UV radiation. It needs intermittent periods of moisture followed by drying, and does not require conventional fertilization, as it absorbs nutrients atmospherically. Replicating its native high-altitude, rocky environment with good air circulation is crucial.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to none; lichens derive nutrients primarily from atmospheric deposition (dust, rain) and their substrate, rather than needing soil-based fertilizers.
