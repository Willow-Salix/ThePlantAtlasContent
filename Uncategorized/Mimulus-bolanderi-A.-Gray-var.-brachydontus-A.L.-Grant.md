## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full to partial sun with well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean habitat. It requires moderate watering during its spring growth but is very drought-tolerant once established, entering dormancy in dry summers. Fertilization is generally not needed.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to average, well-draining soils. Minimal to no fertilization is required.
