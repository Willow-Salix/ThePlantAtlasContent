## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Dana's Lupine prefers cool, high-altitude environments with full sun and exceptionally well-draining soil. Provide moderate, consistent moisture during the active growing season but prioritize excellent drainage to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization is rarely necessary due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen; excessive fertilization can be detrimental. If soil is very poor, a low-phosphorus, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
