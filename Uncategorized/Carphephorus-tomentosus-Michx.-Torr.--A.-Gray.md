## Care Guide
Woolly Chaffhead thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, mimicking its native pine flatwood and savanna habitats. Water moderately, ensuring soil dries slightly between waterings, and fertilize sparingly as it prefers lean conditions. This plant is adapted to open, sun-drenched environments and does not tolerate waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean, well-drained soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring, or none if soil is adequately amended.
