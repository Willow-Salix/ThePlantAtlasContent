# Sea Dahlia

*Tuckermannia maritima Nutt.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal Southern California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Coastal Chaparral/Scrubland) |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight) for robust growth and abundant flowering, tolerating some partial sun in the hottest regions. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering during its spring growing season. Becomes highly drought-tolerant once established and needs very little to no water during its summer dormancy, especially in well-draining soils. |

## Care Guide
This resilient perennial thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, typical of its native Mediterranean coastal environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established, particularly during its summer dormancy, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean, poor to average soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, but avoid over-fertilizing.
