| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Coastal Plain, from North Carolina to Florida and west to Mississippi) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Coastal Plain Ecosystem) |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its native habitat in open pinelands, savannas, and roadsides. |
| **Watering** | Moderate, requiring consistent moisture in well-drained soil; allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerates some drought once established. |

## Introduction
Chrysopsis (golden asters) are plants in the family Asteraceae native to the southern and eastern United States. All the species are found in Florida, although some are found in other states as well.
These are annual and perennial herbs bearing daisy-like flower heads with yellow disc florets and usually yellow ray florets. Some species formerly classified in this genus are now included in other genera: Heterotheca, Pityopsis, Stenotus, Ionactis, Aster, Eucephalus, Erigeron, Machaeranthera, Croptilon, Xanthisma, Oclemena, Bradburia, Oxypappus, Arnica, and Helichrysopsis.
Golden asters are often used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Schinia petulans (which feeds exclusively on C. subulata).

## Care Guide
Thriving in its native humid subtropical climate, the Stiff-leaved Goldenaster requires full sun and well-drained, sandy soil. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and avoid over-fertilization as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
