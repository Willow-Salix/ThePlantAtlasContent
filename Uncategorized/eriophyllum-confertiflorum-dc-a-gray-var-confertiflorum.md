## 🧤 Care Instructions
Golden-Yarrow thrives in full sun, mirroring its native open scrubland environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established and adapting well to lean, unfertilized soils. Avoid overwatering and rich soil to prevent root rot and leggy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils characteristic of scrubland environments; excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
