| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah) and Northern Mexico (Sonora) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers full sun for best growth and flowering. |

## Introduction
Phemeranthus (fameflower) is a genus of flowering plants in the miner's lettuce family, Montiaceae, native to the Americas. It was formerly placed in Portulacaceae. The name is derived from the Greek words εφήμερος (ephemeros), meaning "living for one day," and ἄνθος (anthos), meaning "flower." Common names for the various species are often fame flower, rock rose, rock pink, and sand pink.

## Care Guide
This succulent thrives in conditions that mimic its arid native habitat. Provide abundant sunlight and very well-draining soil, watering sparingly to prevent root rot. Fertilizer needs are low, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very minimal; a diluted, balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, or none if planted in rich soil.
