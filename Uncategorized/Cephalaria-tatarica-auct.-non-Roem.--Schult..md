Cephalaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia imperialis, which feeds exclusively on C. procera.

## Care Guide
This hardy perennial thrives in temperate subalpine conditions. Provide full sun, consistently moist but well-draining soil, and moderate fertility to encourage its tall, airy blooms throughout the summer.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. A single application of balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is typically sufficient in average soil.
