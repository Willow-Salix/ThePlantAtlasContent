## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and high-altitude alpine regions across the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., Scandinavia, North America, Greenland, Siberia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine and Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to full sun, especially in cool, well-ventilated conditions. Tolerates periods of lower light, typical of snow-covered seasons. |
| **💧 Water** | High atmospheric humidity is essential. Regular misting or placement in a terrarium with good air circulation is ideal, allowing for full drying out between hydration cycles to prevent rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arctomia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Arctomiaceae. The genus was established in 1860 by the Swedish lichenologist Theodor Magnus Fries, and species of Arctomia are mainly distributed in circumpolar regions of the Northern Hemisphere. A comprehensive molecular study published in 2025 confirmed that the genus forms a distinct evolutionary lineage within its family. Species typically grow as thin, reddish-brown to blackish crusts on plant debris, mosses, or tree bark in cold northern regions, with their distribution ranging from the Arctic tundra to boreal forests and alpine heaths. The thallus contains cyanobacteria of the genus Nostoc as the photosynthetic partner, giving the lichen a slightly glossy, gelatinous texture when wet. Most species produce minute disc-shaped fruiting bodies containing elongated, many-celled ascospores.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Arctomia lichens thrive in cold, exposed, and humid environments. Provide bright, indirect to full sun with excellent air circulation and maintain high atmospheric humidity through regular misting, ensuring they fully dry between hydration periods. No traditional fertilization is required.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Lichens derive nutrients from the atmosphere, dust, and their substrate (rocks, bark, soil).
