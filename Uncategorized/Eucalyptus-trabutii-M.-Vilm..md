## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia (hybrid tracing parentage to New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical / Warm Temperate Coastal Woodlands and Swamplands |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) to thrive, reflecting its nature as a canopy tree in open landscapes. |
| **Watering** | Needs consistent moisture, especially when young, but prefers well-draining soil. While its parent species tolerate moist to swampy conditions, avoid prolonged waterlogging; allow the top few inches of soil to dry out between deep waterings. |

## Introduction
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## Care Guide
Trabut Gum performs best in full sun and requires consistent moisture in well-draining soil, mirroring its coastal Australian genetic background. Fertilize sparingly with a low-phosphorus blend. This resilient hybrid excels with ample light and regular watering, especially during establishment.

### Fertilizer
Generally has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Use a balanced, slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer, particularly in soils already rich in phosphorus, and apply sparingly, typically once a year in spring.
