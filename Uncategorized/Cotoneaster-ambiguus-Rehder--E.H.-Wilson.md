## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | China (Gansu, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan provinces) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Mountain Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers full sun for optimal growth, flowering, and fruit production. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Established plants demonstrate good drought tolerance but benefit from consistent moisture during dry spells. |

## Introduction
Cotoneaster  is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, native to the Palaearctic region (temperate Asia, Europe, north Africa), with a strong concentration of diversity in the genus in the mountains of southwestern China and the Himalayas. They are related to hawthorns (Crataegus), firethorns (Pyracantha), photinias (Photinia), and rowans (Sorbus).
Depending on the species definition used, between 70 and 300 different species of Cotoneaster are described, with many apomictic microspecies treated as species by some authors, but only as varieties by others.
The majority of species are shrubs from 0.5–5 m (1.6–16.4 ft) tall, varying from ground-hugging prostrate plants to erect shrubs; a few, notably C. frigidus, are small trees up to 15 m (49 ft) tall and 75 cm (30 in) trunk diameter. The prostrate species are mostly alpine plants growing at high altitudes (e.g. C. integrifolius, which grows at 3,000–4,000 m (9,800–13,100 ft) in the Himalayas), while the larger species occur in scrub and woodland gaps at lower altitudes.

## Care Guide
The Ambiguous Cotoneaster is a hardy, adaptable shrub that thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and benefits from minimal fertilization. This species is relatively low-maintenance once established, tolerating a range of temperate conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, especially in poor or nutrient-depleted soils.
