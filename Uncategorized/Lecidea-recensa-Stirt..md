## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic-alpine and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Scandinavia, Scotland, Canada, Alaska, and Greenland. |
| **Climate** | Arctic-Alpine Tundra and Boreal Montane |
| **Sunlight** | High exposure to sunlight, tolerant of direct sun when coupled with cool temperatures and high atmospheric humidity typical of its native exposed rocky habitats. |
| **Watering** | Requires frequent atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, fog, snowmelt) rather than traditional soil watering, as it lacks roots. It is poikilohydric, tolerating desiccation but thriving with regular rehydration. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
Lecidea recensa Stirt. is a slow-growing lichen that thrives in cool, high-altitude or high-latitude environments with ample atmospheric moisture and good air circulation. It should be placed on inert siliceous rock, receiving high light exposure but protected from extreme heat and pollution, as it requires no soil, watering, or fertilization.

### Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer is required; it is highly sensitive to nutrient enrichment and pollution, absorbing all necessary nutrients from air and precipitation.
