## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and dry conditions, mimicking its native arid scrubland and desert habitat. Provide infrequent, deep watering and ensure excellent drainage, allowing the soil to fully dry out between sessions. It is a low-maintenance plant, requiring minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; a light application of a balanced liquid fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, or none if planted in rich soil.
