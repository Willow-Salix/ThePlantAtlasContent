## Care Guide
Provide abundant direct sunlight and ensure excellent drainage to mimic its arid native environment. Water only when the soil is entirely dry, reducing frequency in winter. Fertilize lightly during the warmer growing months.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize sparingly with a diluted, balanced cactus-specific fertilizer during its active growing season (spring and summer).
