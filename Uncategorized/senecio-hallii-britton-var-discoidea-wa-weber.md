## 🧤 Care Instructions
This succulent plant, native to the semi-arid scrublands of South Africa, requires ample full sun exposure and very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. Ensure well-draining soil and minimal fertilization to prevent rot and support its natural growth habits.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in lean, well-draining soils. Apply a diluted, balanced fertilizer specifically formulated for succulents sparingly (e.g., once or twice) during its active growing season (spring and summer).
