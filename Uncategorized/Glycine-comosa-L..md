## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Australia (northern and eastern parts), Southeast Asia (e.g., Philippines, Taiwan), and Pacific Islands (e.g., Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia). |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, ideally receiving at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. It is somewhat drought-tolerant once established but thrives with consistent moisture during active growth. |

## Introduction
Glycine (symbol Gly or G;  ) is an organic compound with the formula C2H5NO2, and is the simplest stable amino acid, distinguished by having a single hydrogen atom as its side chain. As one of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, glycine is a fundamental building block of proteins in all life and is encoded by all codons starting with GG (GGU, GGC, GGA, and GGG). Because of its minimal side chain, it is the only common amino acid that is not chiral, meaning it is superimposable on its mirror image.
In the body, glycine plays several crucial roles. Its small and flexible structure is vital for the formation of certain protein structures, most notably in collagen, where glycine makes up about 35% of the amino acid content and enables the tight coiling of the collagen triple helix. Glycine disrupts the formation of alpha-helices in secondary protein structure, in favor instead of random coils. Beyond its structural role, glycine functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, particularly in the spinal cord and brainstem, where it helps regulate motor and sensory signals. Disruption of glycine signaling can lead to severe neurological disorders and motor dysfunction; for example, the tetanus toxin causes spastic paralysis by blocking glycine release. It also serves as a key precursor for the synthesis of other important biomolecules, including the porphyrins that form heme in blood and the purines used to build DNA and RNA.
Glycine is a white, sweet-tasting crystalline solid, leading to its name from Greek word glykys (Greek: γλυκύς) or "sweet". While the body can synthesize it, it is also obtained from the diet and produced industrially by chemical synthesis for use as a food additive, a nutritional supplement, and an intermediate in the manufacture of products such as the herbicide glyphosate. In aqueous solutions, glycine exists predominantly as a zwitterion (H3N+CH2COO-), a polar molecule with both a positive and negative charge, making it highly soluble in water. It can also fit into hydrophobic environments due to its minimal side chain.

## Care Guide
Woolly Glycine is a resilient vine native to tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in full to partial sun with well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it needs minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance groundcover or climber.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season if soil nutrients are very poor.
