## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
Wright's Goldenrod thrives in sunny, dry conditions typical of its native southwestern US habitat. It is a highly drought-tolerant plant that requires minimal watering once established, preferring well-drained, lean soils. This adaptable perennial is a low-maintenance choice, needing little to no fertilizer to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to average, well-drained soils. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth. A light, balanced fertilizer once in spring is sufficient if the soil is exceptionally poor.
