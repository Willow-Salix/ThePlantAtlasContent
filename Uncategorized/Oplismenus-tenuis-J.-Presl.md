## Care Guide
Thriving in conditions mimicking its native tropical forest understory, this plant requires indirect light, consistently moist soil, and high humidity. Fertilize moderately during warmer months to support its growth, ensuring it's protected from direct sun and waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer; less in winter.
