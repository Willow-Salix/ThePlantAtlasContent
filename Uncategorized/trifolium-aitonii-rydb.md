## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (California, Oregon, Washington) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Sun (prefers bright, direct light for most of the day) |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; allow soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerant of drier periods once established, reflecting its native habitat on dry slopes and meadows. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Aiton's Clover thrives in bright, direct sunlight and prefers well-draining soil that is allowed to dry out between waterings. Being a native of temperate montane regions, it is quite hardy and does not require extensive fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen, so high-nitrogen fertilizers are unnecessary. A balanced, low-dose fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth appears weak.
