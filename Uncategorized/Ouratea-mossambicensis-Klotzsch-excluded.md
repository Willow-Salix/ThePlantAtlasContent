| **Native Origin** | Mozambique |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Woodlands and Coastal Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade, mimicking the understory or dappled sunlight of its native woodland habitat. |

## Introduction
Ouratea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ochnaceae. It includes over 290 species native to the tropical Americas, from Mexico and Cuba to southern Brazil, to Cameroon and Gabon in West-Central Africa, and to Ascension Island in the South Atlantic. Most species are native to the Americas. There are two African species, Ouratea batesii and Ouratea stenophylla, and Ouratea lessonii is endemic to Ascension. Many genera have been brought into synonymy with Ouratea, including Gomphia.

## Care Guide
Provide bright, indirect light or partial shade and consistent moisture during the growing season, reducing water during dormancy. Fertilize moderately when actively growing. This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical woodland origin.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Less frequent or no fertilization during dormancy.
