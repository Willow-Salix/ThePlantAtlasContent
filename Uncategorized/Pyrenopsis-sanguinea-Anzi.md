## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Alpine and boreal regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe (e.g., Alps, Scandinavia), North America, and Russia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and exposed Montane Regions |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to high direct light, mimicking its growth on exposed rock surfaces often above the treeline. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent but thorough watering, allowing complete drying between periods. It is highly tolerant of drought and requires good air circulation, not constantly wet conditions. |

## Introduction
Pyrenopsis is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Porocyphaceae. The lichens grow on constantly wet, shaded rock faces where they form gelatinous crusts that soften and show reddish tints when moistened. They reproduce through small, buried fruiting bodies that open as pore-like structures at the surface.

## Care Guide
Pyrenopsis sanguinea thrives in conditions mirroring its native alpine environment: full sun exposure and infrequent, thorough watering followed by complete drying. Avoid any fertilizers as they are detrimental to lichen health, which acquire nutrients from the air and natural substrate.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens are extremely sensitive to chemicals and fertilizers, obtaining all necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate.
