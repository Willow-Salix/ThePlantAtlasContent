## 🧤 Care Instructions
Orcutt's Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean chaparral. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering, especially during dry summer months. Avoid excessive fertilization as it is a nitrogen-fixer and prefers leaner soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and prefers lean, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, can be detrimental.
