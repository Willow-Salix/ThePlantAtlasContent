## Introduction
Baptisia (wild indigo, false indigo) is a genus in the legume family, Fabaceae. They are flowering herbaceous perennial plants with pea-like flowers, followed by pods, which are sometimes inflated. They are native to woodland and grassland in eastern and southern North America. The species most commonly found in cultivation is B. australis.
Baptisia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the jaguar flower moth, Schinia jaguarina.

## Care Guide
This native perennial thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Once established, it is extremely drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering or fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for temperate gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen and prefers lean to average soil. Avoid excessive nitrogen.
