## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Africa and parts of South Asia |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Savanna and Monsoon Climates |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and optimal pod production, mimicking its open native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering is needed, especially during dry spells and when flowering and fruiting. Allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings, as it's accustomed to periods of both heavy rain and drier conditions. |

## Care Guide
This resilient tropical legume thrives in full sun and requires consistent moisture, particularly during its active growth and fruiting stages. While it naturally enriches soil with nitrogen, supplemental balanced fertilizer can boost yields. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization is generally sufficient. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen; therefore, excessive nitrogen should be avoided. A balanced NPK fertilizer can be applied if soil nutrients are poor, especially for phosphorus and potassium to support flowering and fruiting.
