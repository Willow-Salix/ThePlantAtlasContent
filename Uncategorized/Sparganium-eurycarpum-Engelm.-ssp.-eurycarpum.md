## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (widespread across Canada and the northern/central United States) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Freshwater Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, brightly lit wetland environments with direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently saturated to submerged conditions, typically in shallow freshwater (ponds, marshes, slow streams). It cannot tolerate dry soil or prolonged drought. |

## Introduction
Sparganium (bur-reed) is a genus of flowering plants, described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753. It is widespread in  wet areas in temperate regions of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The plants are perennial marsh plants that can grow to 3.5 m (depending on the species), with epicene flowers.
It was previously placed alone in the family Sparganiaceae. Sparganium is closely related to the Typhaceae and the APG III system (2009) includes Sparganium in that family. It has been determined from phylogenetic analysis to be the closest living relative of the genus Typha (cat-tail).

## Care Guide
The Giant Bur-reed is an aquatic plant demanding consistently wet to submerged conditions, thriving best in full to partial sun. It requires a temperate freshwater wetland environment with moderate nutrient levels, making it ideal for ponds or water gardens where its native habitat can be replicated.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. It is adapted to the nutrient cycling of wetland muck and sediment. Supplemental fertilization is generally not heavily needed if grown in a suitable aquatic environment with some organic matter.
