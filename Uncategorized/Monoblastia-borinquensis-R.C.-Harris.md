| **Sunlight** | Indirect, low to medium light. Thrives in shaded conditions typical of a forest understory, away from direct harsh sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires very high atmospheric humidity (70-90%) and frequent misting, as it absorbs moisture directly from the air. Does not require traditional watering of soil, as it is an epiphytic lichen. |

## Care Guide
This is a tropical lichen, not a vascular plant, requiring specialized care. It thrives in exceptionally high humidity and indirect light, mimicking its native rainforest habitat. Avoid direct sun and traditional soil-based watering or fertilization, focusing instead on atmospheric moisture.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens do not require traditional fertilization and may be harmed by it. They obtain nutrients from the air, rain, and their substrate.
