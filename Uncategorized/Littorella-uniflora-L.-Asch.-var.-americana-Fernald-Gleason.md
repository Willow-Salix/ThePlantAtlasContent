## Care Guide
This aquatic to semi-aquatic plant thrives in temperate regions, requiring full sun to partial shade. It must be kept constantly submerged or in saturated soil, benefiting from low to moderate nutrient levels to prevent algal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; excess nutrients can harm the plant and promote algal blooms
