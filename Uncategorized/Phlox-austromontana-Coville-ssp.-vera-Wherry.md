## Introduction
Phlox (; Ancient Greek: φλόξ "flame"; plural "phlox" or "phloxes", Ancient Greek: φλόγες phlóges) is a genus of 68 species of perennial and annual plants in the family Polemoniaceae. They are found mostly in North America (one in Siberia) in diverse habitats from alpine tundra to open woodland and prairie. Some flower in spring, others in summer and fall.

## Care Guide
This Phlox subspecies thrives in conditions mimicking its arid montane native habitat. Provide full sun exposure and well-drained, lean soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to fully dry out between infrequent, deep waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to rot in consistently wet conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; thrives in lean, rocky, or sandy soils. Excessive fertilization can harm the plant.
