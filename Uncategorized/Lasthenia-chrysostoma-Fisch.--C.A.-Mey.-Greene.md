## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA and Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean climate, primarily found in grasslands, open fields, and vernal pools |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, reflecting its native habitat in open, exposed areas. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture during its active growth period (winter to late spring), mimicking the wet season in its native climate. It can tolerate temporary inundation (as in vernal pools) but generally prefers well-draining soil that doesn't stay waterlogged for prolonged periods. It dies back as summer drought begins. |

## Care Guide
Goldfields is an annual wildflower native to California's Mediterranean climate, thriving in full sun. It needs consistent moisture during its winter-spring growth cycle and prefers average to poor soil without heavy fertilization. This plant completes its life cycle before the onset of summer drought.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a native wildflower, it thrives in average to poor soils and does not require rich nutrients or heavy fertilization. Excessive fertilizer can sometimes lead to lush foliage at the expense of flowers.
