## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Northern Europe (e.g., Sweden, Finland, Baltic states, Poland, Czech Republic) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest / Boreal Forest margins |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in full sun for best flowering and fruiting as it naturally grows at forest edges or open scrubland. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, ensuring consistent moisture when young, but allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Established plants exhibit good drought tolerance, reflecting the seasonal rainfall of its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
Lindman's Hawthorn thrives in temperate climates with full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering, particularly when young, and benefits from well-draining soil. Light fertilization in spring supports healthy growth and fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied in early spring is sufficient, especially if planted in poor soil, mirroring the moderate nutrient availability of typical forest edge soils.
