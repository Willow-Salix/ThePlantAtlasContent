## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to semi-arid scrublands and high-altitude plateaus |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright, direct light for optimal growth and flowering, typical of its native open desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water deeply during the growing season (spring/summer) and reduce significantly or withhold water during the dormant winter months to mimic desert rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Mammillaria is one of the largest genera in the cactus family (Cactaceae), with currently 200 known species and varieties recognized. Most of the mammillarias are native to Mexico, while some come from the Southwestern United States, the Caribbean, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras and Venezuela. The common name "pincushion cactus" refers to this genus and the closely related Escobaria.
The first species was described by Carl Linnaeus as Cactus mammillaris in 1753, deriving its name from the Latin mammilla, "nipple", referring to the tubercles that are among the distinctive features of the genus. Numerous species are commonly known as globe cactus, nipple cactus, birthday cake cactus, fishhook cactus or pincushion cactus (though such terms are also commonly used for related taxa, such as Escobaria or Ferocactus).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This succulent thrives in conditions similar to its native central Mexican arid scrublands. Provide abundant bright sunlight and ensure infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to fully dry out between sessions. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted cactus formula during its growth period to support its low-nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer. Use a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer). Desert soils are typically low in organic matter.
