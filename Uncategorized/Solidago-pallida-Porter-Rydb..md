# Pale Goldenrod

*Solidago pallida (Porter) Rydb.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Western United States (e.g., Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Prairie |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sun daily) |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water regularly during dry periods, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. |

## Introduction
In computing, on the X Window System, X11 color names are represented in a simple text file, which maps certain strings to RGB color values. It was traditionally shipped with every X11 installation, hence the name, and is usually located in <X11root>/lib/X11/rgb.txt. The web colors list is descended from it but differs for certain color names.
Color names are not standardized by Xlib or the X11 protocol. The list does not show continuity either in selected color values or in color names, and some color triplets have multiple names. Despite this, graphic designers and others got used to them, making it practically impossible to introduce a different list. In earlier releases of X11 (prior to the introduction of Xcms), server implementors were encouraged to modify the RGB values in the reference color database to account for gamma correction.
As of X.Org Release 7.4 rgb.txt is no longer included in the roll up release, and the list is built directly into the server. The optional module xorg/app/rgb contains the stand-alone rgb.txt file.
The list first shipped with X10 release 3 (X10R3) on 7 June 1986, having been checked into RCS by Jim Gettys in 1985. The same list was in X11R1 on 18 September 1987. Approximately the full list as is available today shipped with X11R4 on 29 January 1989, with substantial additions by Paul Ravelling (who added colors based on Sinclair Paints samples), John C. Thomas (who added colors based on a set of 72 Crayola crayons he had on hand) and Jim Fulton (who reconciled contributions to produce the X11R4 list). The project was running DEC VT240 terminals at the time, so would have worked to that device.
In some applications multipart names are written with spaces, in others joined together, often in camel case. They are usually matched insensitive of case and the X Server source code contains spaced aliases for most entries; this article uses spaces and uppercase initials except where variants with spaces are not specified in the actual code.

## Care Guide
Pale Goldenrod is a robust prairie plant that flourishes in full sun and well-drained, average to lean soils. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering. It generally requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for naturalized areas.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in average to lean soil and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth is poor.
