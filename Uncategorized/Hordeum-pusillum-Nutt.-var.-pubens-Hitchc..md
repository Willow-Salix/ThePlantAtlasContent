## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across the United States, parts of southern Canada, and Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie, often in dry, open, or disturbed habitats. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, as it typically grows in open, exposed areas. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to periods of dry weather. |

## Introduction
Hordeum pusillum, also known as little barley, is an annual grass native to most of the United States and southwestern Canada. It arrived via multiple long-distance dispersals of a southern South American species of Hordeum about one million years ago. Its closest relatives are therefore not the other North American taxa like meadow barley (Hordeum brachyantherum) or foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum), but rather Hordeum species of the Pampas of central Argentina and Uruguay. It is less closely related to the Old World domesticated barley, from which it diverged about 12 million years ago. It is diploid.

## Care Guide
Little Barley is a resilient temperate grass that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It requires minimal watering, tolerating drought conditions once established, and has no significant fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This wild grass is adapted to average to poor soils and does not require rich fertility or regular fertilization.
