## Care Guide
This plant demands consistently wet to waterlogged soil conditions, making it ideal for bog gardens or aquatic containers. It thrives in full sun but can adapt to partial shade. Due to its natural habitat, it is not a heavy feeder and requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low. Generally adapted to nutrient-poor wetland soils, suggesting it does not require heavy feeding. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, typically once a year with a balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength.
