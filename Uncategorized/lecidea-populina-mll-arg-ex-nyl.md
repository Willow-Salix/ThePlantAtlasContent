## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in humid, temperate conditions with bright indirect light or partial shade. It requires high ambient humidity and consistent moisture from the air, preferably through regular misting. No traditional watering or fertilizer is needed, as it absorbs nutrients atmospherically.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate.
