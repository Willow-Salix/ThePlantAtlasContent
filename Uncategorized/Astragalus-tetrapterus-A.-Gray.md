## Care Guide
This desert-adapted perennial thrives in full sun and requires minimal water once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It prefers well-draining soil and does not need frequent fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes its own nitrogen, so supplemental fertilization is generally not required.
