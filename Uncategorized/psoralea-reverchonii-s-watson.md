## 🧤 Care Instructions
Reverchon's Scurfpea thrives on neglect, requiring full sun and well-drained, lean soil to mimic its native dry grassland environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs minimal watering once established. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. Rich soils can promote leaf growth over flowers; lean, well-draining soil is preferred.
