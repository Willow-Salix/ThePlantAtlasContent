## 🌱 Overview
Hedyotis (starviolet) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. Many species of this genus such as Hedyotis biflora, H. corymbosa and H. diffusa are well known medicinal plants. Hedyotis is native to tropical and subtropical Asia and to islands of the northwest Pacific. It comprises about 115 species. The type species for the genus is Hedyotis fruticosa.
Hedyotis was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in Species Plantarum. This generic name is derived from two Greek words, hedys, "sweet", and otos, "ear", in reference to the sweet-scented, ear-shaped leaves of some species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian native thrives in conditions similar to its high-elevation wet tropical forest home. Provide bright indirect light, consistent soil moisture, and moderate feeding during its growing period. Ensure high humidity to best replicate its natural environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, due to the nutrient cycling typical of tropical forest soils.
