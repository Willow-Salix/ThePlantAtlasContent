## Care Guide
Angel's-wings thrives in bright, full sun conditions, mimicking its native Mexican desert habitat. It requires extremely infrequent watering, as it is highly susceptible to root rot from overwatering, making well-draining soil paramount. Fertilization should be minimal, primarily during the spring and summer months.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Apply a balanced, diluted cactus or succulent fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring and early summer) if desired, but it is not strictly necessary for healthy growth in well-draining soil.
