## Care Guide
Grimmia gracilis thrives in bright indirect to partial sun conditions, mimicking its native rocky habitats. It requires infrequent but thorough watering, allowing it to dry out between sessions, and exhibits high tolerance to drought. This hardy moss has very minimal nutrient needs and does not typically require fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Fertilization is generally not required; mosses obtain sufficient nutrients from water and air.
