## Introduction
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant perennial thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its native arid to semi-arid western North American habitats. Once established, it requires infrequent, deep watering and minimal to no fertilization to prevent root rot and encourage its natural growth habit.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. These plants are adapted to lean, well-draining soils and can be harmed by excessive nutrients.
