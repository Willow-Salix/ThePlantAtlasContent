## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean scrubland habitat. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.
