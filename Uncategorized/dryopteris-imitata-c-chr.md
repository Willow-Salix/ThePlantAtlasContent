## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Japan (Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers low to moderate indirect light; thrives in dappled or filtered sun, avoiding harsh direct sunlight, similar to a forest understory. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, but not waterlogged, mimicking its native moist woodland floor. High humidity is also beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
The moth genus Dryopteris is now considered a junior synonym of Oreta.

Dryopteris , commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to Dryopteris filix-mas), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales.
Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American Dryopteris hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization.
The fossil record of this genus shows that it was widespread even as far back as the Cretaceous with fossils being found in Late Cretaceous rock layers from North America down to Antarctica.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate forest fern thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions, reflecting its native woodland understory habitat. Provide consistently moist soil, high ambient humidity, and protect it from direct sun to ensure optimal growth and health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season, or enrichment with organic matter to simulate nutrient cycling in forest soils.
