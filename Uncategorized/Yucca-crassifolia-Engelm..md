## Care Guide
Spanish Bayonet thrives in abundant sunlight and well-draining soil, preferring full sun exposure. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent deep watering once established, and requires minimal fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean, sandy soils and typically requires little to no fertilization. A very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if growth seems stunted.
