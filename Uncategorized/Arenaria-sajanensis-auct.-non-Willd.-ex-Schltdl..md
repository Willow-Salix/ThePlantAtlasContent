## Care Guide
This plant, likely originating from the Alpine Tundra of the Sayan Mountains, requires conditions that mimic its harsh native habitat. Provide full sun and ensure excellent soil drainage, allowing the substrate to dry between moderate waterings. Minimal fertilization is best to prevent lush, unnatural growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal. Alpine soils are typically lean; a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient only if growth appears weak. Avoid over-fertilizing.
