| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily). It thrives in intense, direct light, characteristic of its open desert habitat. |

## Care Guide
The Cardón requires conditions mimicking its native arid desert: maximum direct sunlight and very infrequent watering. Use extremely well-draining soil and fertilize minimally during its active growth period to ensure robust health.

### Fertilizer
Low. Apply a balanced, diluted cactus fertilizer sparingly (once or twice) during the active growing season (spring and summer). Desert soils are typically nutrient-poor.
