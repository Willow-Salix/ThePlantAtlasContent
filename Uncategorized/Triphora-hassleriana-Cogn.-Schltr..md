## Care Guide
This terrestrial or occasionally epiphytic orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its native subtropical moist forest floor. Provide consistent moisture, high humidity, and low to moderate indirect light. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted orchid-specific formula during its growing season to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Use a weak, balanced orchid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) every 2-4 weeks during active growth, reducing frequency in cooler or dormant periods.
