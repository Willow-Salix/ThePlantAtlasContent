## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, including parts of South America, Central America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Rainforests and Humid Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to dappled light; avoid direct, intense sunlight. As epiphytic organisms, they thrive in the understory light conditions of their native habitat. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and consistent moisture are crucial. Replicate frequent rainfall or high atmospheric moisture; misting may be beneficial if grown indoors. Do not allow to dry out completely for extended periods. |

## Care Guide
Laurera lichens thrive in high humidity and consistent moisture, preferring partial shade to dappled light. They require no fertilization, obtaining nutrients naturally from their environment. Mimic their native tropical and subtropical forest conditions for successful growth.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from their environment (air, rain, substrate) and can be harmed by artificial fertilization.
