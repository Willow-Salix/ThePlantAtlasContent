## Care Guide
This plant, commonly referred to as River Bulrush (often a misidentification for 'Scirpus spadiceus auct. non L.'), is a wetland species requiring a consistently wet to submerged environment. It thrives in full sun and rich soil, mimicking its native freshwater wetland habitats. Ensure constant moisture for robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high nutrient requirements. Thrives in rich, mucky, or silty soils common in wetland environments. An annual application of a balanced aquatic plant fertilizer can be beneficial, especially if grown in containers.
