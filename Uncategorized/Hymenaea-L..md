# Jatoba

*Hymenaea L.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Americas (from Mexico and the Caribbean south to Brazil) and East Africa (Madagascar) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests (Rainforests) and Tropical Dry Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. As canopy or emergent trees in their native habitat, they require ample sunlight for optimal growth, especially when mature. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, mimicking the high rainfall of their native tropical environment during growing seasons. Can tolerate short dry periods once established. |

## Care Guide
Provide a warm, humid environment with abundant sunlight to mimic its tropical origins. Ensure consistent moisture during active growth, allowing slight drying between waterings. Fertilize moderately during the growing season to support its vigorous development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer. Being a legume, they fix nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen may not be necessary.
