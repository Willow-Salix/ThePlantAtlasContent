## Care Guide
Savin thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil, mirroring its native habitat on rocky, exposed mountain slopes. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal supplemental watering. Fertilization is generally not needed, making it a low-maintenance choice for challenging growing conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically does not require regular fertilization. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring for young or underperforming plants, but avoid over-fertilizing.
