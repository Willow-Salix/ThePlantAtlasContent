## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, moist environments similar to its native high-elevation forest and meadow habitats. Provide partial sun or filtered light and ensure consistently moist, well-draining soil. Minimal fertilization is generally sufficient for robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. A light annual application of a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich, organic soil.
