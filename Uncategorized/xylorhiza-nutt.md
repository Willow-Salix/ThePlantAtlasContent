## 🧤 Care Instructions
Woodyaster thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland. Provide full, direct sun and water very sparingly, ensuring the soil is completely dry before rewatering. Fertilizer is generally not required.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; typically does not require regular fertilization. A very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once annually in early spring if growth appears stunted, but often unnecessary.
