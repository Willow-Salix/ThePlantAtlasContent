| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine (open forests, meadows, clearings) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in environments with good light exposure, typical of open meadows and forest edges. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to low. Requires consistent moisture during establishment but is drought-tolerant once mature. Prefers well-drained soil and occasional watering only during prolonged dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Western North American native thrives in full sun to partial shade within well-drained, lean soils typical of montane and subalpine meadows. Once established, it is relatively drought-tolerant, requiring moderate to low watering, and benefits from minimal fertilization to prevent leggy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soils. Avoid excessive fertilization, which can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
