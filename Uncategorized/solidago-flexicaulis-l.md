## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Zigzag Goldenrod, provide partial to full shade conditions that mimic its woodland origins. Maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, preferably rich in organic matter, to support its hydration and nutrient needs. Minimal supplemental fertilization is usually required.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to rich soil, high in organic matter, mirroring the nutrient-rich forest floor formed by decomposing leaf litter. Supplemental fertilization is generally not needed if grown in good quality soil.
