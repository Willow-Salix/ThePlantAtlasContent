## Introduction
Lilium ( LIL-ee-əm) is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants growing from bulbs, all with large and often prominent flowers. Lilies are a group of flowering plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world. Most species are native to the Northern Hemisphere and their range is temperate climates and extends into the subtropics. Many other plants have "lily" in their common names, but do not belong to the same genus and are therefore not true lilies. True lilies are known to be highly toxic to cats.

## Care Guide
This lily thrives in temperate montane conditions with well-drained soil. Provide full sun to partial shade and moderate, consistent watering during spring growth, allowing the soil to dry out as it enters summer dormancy. Fertilize lightly in early spring.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in early spring as new growth emerges.
