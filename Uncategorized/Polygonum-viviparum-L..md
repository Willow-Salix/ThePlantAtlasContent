## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Subarctic regions, and alpine/subalpine zones of temperate mountain ranges across Europe, Asia, and North America (e.g., Scandinavia, Siberia, Himalayas, Rockies, Alps). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, Boreal open areas. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. It thrives in open, exposed locations during its short growing season, often with intense light. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist, especially during the growing season, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. It relies on snowmelt and consistent moisture. |

## Introduction
Bistorta vivipara (synonym Persicaria vivipara) is a perennial herbaceous flowering plant in the knotweed and buckwheat family Polygonaceae, commonly known as alpine bistort. Scientific synonyms include Bistorta vivipara and Polygonum viviparum. It is common all over the high Arctic through Europe,  North America, incl. Greenland, and temperate and tropical Asia. Its range stretches further south in high mountainous areas such as the Alps, Carpathians, Pyrenees, Caucasus, Alaska and the Tibetan Plateau.

## Care Guide
Alpine Bistort thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained conditions with full to partial sun, mimicking its native alpine and arctic habitats. Provide consistent moisture during the growing season while ensuring excellent drainage, and use minimal to no fertilizer to prevent over-enrichment.

### Fertilizer
Low. Native soils are typically thin and nutrient-poor. A very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all, is usually sufficient.
