# Large-Leaf Yellow Teatree
### *Leptospermum morrisonii J. Thomp.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern Queensland and northeastern New South Wales, Australia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical and Warm Temperate Heathlands and Wet Sclerophyll Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it thrives in open areas or under light canopy, indicating a need for good light exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist soil, especially during dry periods. Its presence in wet heaths and along watercourses indicates it does not tolerate prolonged drought but also requires good drainage to avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Leptospermum  is a genus of shrubs and small trees in the myrtle family Myrtaceae commonly known as tea trees, although this name is sometimes also used for some species of Melaleuca. Most species are endemic to Australia, with the greatest diversity in the south of the continent, but some are native to other parts of the world, including New Zealand and Southeast Asia. Leptospermums all have five conspicuous petals and five groups of stamens which alternate with the petals. There is a single style in the centre of the flower and the fruit is a woody capsule.
The first formal description of a leptospermum was published in 1776 by the German botanists Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Johann Georg Adam Forster, but an unambiguous definition of individual species in the genus was not achieved until 1979. Leptospermums grow in a wide range of habitats but are most commonly found in moist, low-nutrient soils. They have important uses in horticulture, in the production of honey and in floristry.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native habitat in wet Australian heathlands and forests. It requires regular watering, particularly during dry spells, and should only be fertilized with a low-phosphorus product designed for native plants due to its sensitivity to high phosphorus levels.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low-phosphorus fertilizer specifically formulated for Australian native plants, applied sparingly in spring. Australian native soils are typically low in nutrients, and high phosphorus levels can be detrimental.
