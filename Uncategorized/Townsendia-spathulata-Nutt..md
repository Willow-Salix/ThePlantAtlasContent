## Care Guide
This hardy alpine plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, requiring minimal watering once established due to its excellent drought tolerance. Avoid rich soils and overwatering to ensure its health and longevity, mimicking its native arid montane habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Native soils are typically lean and nutrient-poor, so rich soils or excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
