## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern North America, specifically the Great Plains and southeastern United States. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Prairie |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open prairies and clearings. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Its deep taproot allows it to tolerate drought conditions typical of its native environment, so overwatering should be avoided. |

## Introduction
Callirhoe is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. Its nine species are commonly known as poppy mallows and all are native to the prairies and grasslands of North America. Of the nine species, some are annuals while others are perennial plants.
The genus is named for the Oceanid Callirrhoe in Greek mythology.
Poppy mallow leaves are alternate and palmately lobed. The flowers are cup-shaped and brightly colored.
The purple poppy mallow (Callirhoe involucrata) is grown as a garden plant. It is a low-growing perennial with a large taproot and hairy stems. The flowers range from cerise to reddish violet with white centers. It is especially used in dry climates.
Species include:

Callirhoe bushii Fernald – Bush's poppy mallow
Callirhoe digitata Nutt. – fringed poppy mallow, winecup
Callirhoe involucrata (Torr. & A.Gray) A.Gray – purple poppy mallow, winecup
Callirhoe leiocarpa R.F.Martin – tall poppy mallow
Callirhoe papaver (Cav.) A.Gray – woodland poppy mallow

## Care Guide
Poppy Mallow thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native prairie environment. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. Avoid over-fertilization to maintain its characteristic growth habit.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant thrives in average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization; excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
