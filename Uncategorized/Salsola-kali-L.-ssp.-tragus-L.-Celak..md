## Introduction
Salsola is a genus of the subfamily Salsoloideae in the family Amaranthaceae. The genus sensu stricto is distributed in Australia, central and southwestern Asia, North Africa, and the Mediterranean. Common names of various members of this genus and related genera are saltwort (for their salt tolerance) and tumbleweed or roly-poly. The genus name Salsola is from the Latin salsus, meaning 'salty'.

## Care Guide
Russian Thistle is an extremely resilient plant that thrives in full sun and requires very little water, tolerating severe drought conditions. It prefers poor, well-draining soil and typically needs no fertilization to flourish. The most critical care involves avoiding overwatering, which can quickly lead to root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to poor, disturbed soils and does not require rich nutrients or regular fertilization.
