## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, ranging from eastern Canada and the Great Lakes region south to the southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Alabama). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Bogs and Fens |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and vibrant coloration. |
| **Watering** | Constantly moist to wet substrate. Use only distilled, rain, or reverse osmosis water; never tap water due to its sensitivity to minerals. Keep the pot standing in a tray of pure water. |

## Introduction
Sarracenia ( or ) is a genus comprising 8 to 11 species of North American pitcher plants, commonly called trumpet pitchers. The genus belongs to the family Sarraceniaceae, which also contain the closely allied genera Darlingtonia and Heliamphora.
Sarracenia is a genus of carnivorous plants indigenous to the eastern seaboard of the United States, Texas, the Great Lakes area and southeastern Canada, with most species occurring only in the south-east United States (only S. purpurea occurs in cold-temperate regions). The plant's leaves have evolved into a funnel or pitcher shape in order to trap insects.
The plant attracts its insect prey with secretions from extrafloral nectaries on the lip of the pitcher leaves, as well as a combination of the leaves' color and scent. Slippery footing at the pitcher's rim causes insects to fall inside, where they die and are digested by the plant with proteases and other enzymes.

## Care Guide
Sarracenia heterophylla thrives in full sun and requires a consistently wet, acidic, nutrient-poor environment, mimicking its native bog habitat. Always use pure water like distilled or rainwater, and strictly avoid all traditional fertilizers. Provide ample sunlight and never let the soil dry out to ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizers. These plants obtain all necessary nutrients from the insects they capture. Fertilizing the soil can severely harm or kill the plant.
