## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of North America (e.g., Eastern U.S., Pacific Northwest) and Europe |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to partial shade; often found in shaded understory or on bark, avoiding direct intense sun. |
| **Watering** | High humidity; frequent misting or exposure to consistent moisture, allowing to dry slightly between wettings as lichens absorb water from air and rain. |

## Introduction
Pertusaria is a large genus of warty crustose lichens in the Pertusariaceae family. The fruiting bodies are usually modified apothecia that immersed in warts on the main body (thallus) with small holes for the spores to emerge, similar to ostioles, or are fully above and lecanorine (spore bearing discs surrounded by a ring of tissue similar to the tissue of the thallus.  Members of the genus are commonly called wart lichens.
The widespread genus contains over 500 species.
Classification in the large genus relies heavily on thallus chemistry to distinguish and classify species, some of which differ only in the presence or absence of a single secondary chemical. Lichexanthone, norlichexanthone, and their chlorinated derivatives are common in this genus.

## Care Guide
Pore Lichen thrives in environments mimicking its native temperate forest habitat. It requires consistent high humidity, indirect light to partial shade, and no traditional fertilization. Ensure regular misting or exposure to consistent moisture for optimal health, allowing the lichen to dry slightly between wettings.

### Fertilizer
None; lichens obtain essential nutrients from the atmosphere, rain, and their substrate, not requiring traditional fertilization.
