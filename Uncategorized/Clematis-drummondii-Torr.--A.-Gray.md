| **Climate** | Arid and Semi-arid Scrubland/Desert (e.g., Chihuahuan Desert) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating intense sun but appreciating some afternoon shade in the hottest climates, especially for its roots. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between watering sessions, mimicking its native arid rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Clematis is a genus of about 380 species within the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae. Their garden hybrids and cultivars have been popular among gardeners, beginning with Clematis 'Jackmanii', a garden staple since 1862. More cultivars are being produced constantly,  mainly of Chinese and Japanese origin.

## Care Guide
Drummond's Clematis thrives in full sun to partial shade within its native arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, necessitating infrequent yet deep watering, and requires only minimal fertilization for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder; an annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, as it thrives in lean, well-draining soils.
