## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Alpine and arctic regions across Europe (e.g., Alps, Scandinavia), North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Greenland, Alaska), and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun; tolerant of morning direct sun. Avoid intense, prolonged afternoon sun, especially in warmer climates, to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage. This moss thrives with constant dampness from meltwater, rain, or fog, but not standing water. It can tolerate short dry periods by going dormant. |

## Care Guide
Schistidium brunnescens thrives in cool, bright, and consistently moist conditions, mimicking its native alpine and arctic rock habitats. Ensure excellent drainage and provide bright indirect light or partial sun to prevent desiccation. Fertilization is generally not needed.

### Fertilizer
Not required; mosses obtain sufficient nutrients from water and the substrate. High fertility can be detrimental. If absolutely necessary, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly.
