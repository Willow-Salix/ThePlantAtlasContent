## Care Guide
Yuma Silverbush is a resilient desert plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. It requires minimal water once established, mimicking its native arid habitat. Fertilization is generally not needed, aligning with its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils and generally does not require fertilization. If desired, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
