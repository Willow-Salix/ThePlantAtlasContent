## Care Guide
To successfully cultivate Ray Goldenweed, replicate its native montane semi-arid habitat by providing full sun and excellent drainage. Water sparingly once established, especially during summer, and avoid rich soils or heavy fertilization to prevent overgrowth.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to poor to moderately fertile soils; excessive fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
