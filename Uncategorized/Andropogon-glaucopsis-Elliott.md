## 🧤 Care Instructions
Purple Bluestem is a low-maintenance grass best suited for full sun exposure and well-drained soils, mimicking its native subtropical savanna and pine flatwoods environment. It requires moderate watering until established but is highly drought-tolerant thereafter, with minimal fertilization needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in naturally poor, sandy soils and does not require heavy fertilization. Excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
