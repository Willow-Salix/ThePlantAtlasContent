## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Savanna and Pine Flatwoods |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open savanna and flatwoods habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; water regularly during establishment, then highly drought-tolerant once mature. Allow soil to dry out between waterings, reflecting the distinct wet/dry cycles of its native climate. |

## Care Guide
Purple Bluestem is a low-maintenance grass best suited for full sun exposure and well-drained soils, mimicking its native subtropical savanna and pine flatwoods environment. It requires moderate watering until established but is highly drought-tolerant thereafter, with minimal fertilization needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in naturally poor, sandy soils and does not require heavy fertilization. Excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
