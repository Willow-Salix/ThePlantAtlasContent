## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America, particularly the Great Lakes region of USA and Canada |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to bright indirect light, mimicking filtered light under a temperate forest canopy. Avoid direct, harsh sunlight. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity and regular exposure to moisture from rain or dew. Requires consistent moisture in the environment but no standing water, as it absorbs water directly from the air and surfaces. |

## Introduction
Pertusaria is a large genus of warty crustose lichens in the Pertusariaceae family. The fruiting bodies are usually modified apothecia that immersed in warts on the main body (thallus) with small holes for the spores to emerge, similar to ostioles, or are fully above and lecanorine (spore bearing discs surrounded by a ring of tissue similar to the tissue of the thallus.  Members of the genus are commonly called wart lichens.
The widespread genus contains over 500 species.
Classification in the large genus relies heavily on thallus chemistry to distinguish and classify species, some of which differ only in the presence or absence of a single secondary chemical. Lichexanthone, norlichexanthone, and their chlorinated derivatives are common in this genus.

## Care Guide
Pore lichen thrives in the humid, shaded conditions of temperate forests, requiring moderate to bright indirect light and high atmospheric moisture. It obtains all necessary nutrients and water directly from the environment, making traditional watering or fertilization methods unsuitable.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no external fertilization. Lichens absorb trace nutrients from the air, rain, and accumulated surface dust; traditional plant fertilizers are unnecessary and can be detrimental.
