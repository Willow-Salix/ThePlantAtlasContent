## Care Guide
This plant thrives in warm, humid conditions typical of its native southeastern U.S. habitat. Provide full to partial sun and moderate watering, ensuring good drainage to mimic its natural sandy soil environment. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced all-purpose feed during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low, native to sandy, often nutrient-poor soils. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring to fall), or use a slow-release granular product once a year.
