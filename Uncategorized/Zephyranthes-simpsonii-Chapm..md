## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida, also parts of Georgia and Alabama) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in moist pinelands, savannas, and prairies) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight for optimal flowering, tolerates afternoon shade in very hot climates). |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist during active growth (spring/summer), allowing the top inch to dry out between waterings. Reduce watering significantly or cease during dormant periods (late fall/winter) to mimic its native wet/dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Zephyranthes  is a genus of temperate and tropical bulbous plants in the Amaryllis family, subfamily Amaryllidoideae, native to the Americas and widely cultivated as ornamentals. Following the expansion of the genus in 2019, which now includes the genera Habranthus and Sprekelia, there are about 200 recognized species, as well as numerous hybrids and cultivars. Common names for species in this genus include fairy lily, rainflower, zephyr lily, magic lily, Atamasco lily,  and rain lily.
The name is derived from Ζέφυρος (Zephyrus), the Greek god of the west wind, and ἄνθος (anthos), meaning flower, referring to the slender stalks.

## Care Guide
Thriving in a humid subtropical environment, the Redmargin Zephyrlily requires full to partial sun exposure. Maintain consistent soil moisture during its growing season, allowing for good drainage, and reduce watering during dormancy. Feed lightly with a balanced fertilizer to support its robust growth and prolific blooming.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a liquid feed diluted to half strength every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season. Avoid over-fertilizing.
