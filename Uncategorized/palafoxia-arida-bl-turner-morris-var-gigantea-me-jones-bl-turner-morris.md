## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, tolerating long periods of drought. It needs well-draining soil and very little, if any, supplemental fertilizer to mimic its natural arid environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; a light, balanced fertilizer applied once a year in spring is sufficient for potted plants, or typically no fertilizer is needed for plants in the ground.
