## 🧤 Care Instructions
This vigorous plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering during its active growth period, though it tolerates some drought once established. Fertilize moderately with a balanced formula during the growing season to support its robust growth, especially in less fertile soils, noting its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied during the growing season, especially in poorer soils. As a legume, it contributes to nitrogen fixation.
