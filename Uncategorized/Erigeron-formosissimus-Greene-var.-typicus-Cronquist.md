## Care Guide
This montane wildflower thrives in full sun with well-drained soil, requiring moderate moisture, especially during its growth phase. It is adapted to the fluctuating conditions of its native mountain habitat and generally requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typically thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring is sufficient, or none if the soil is naturally rich.
