## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Brazil (specifically Rio Grande do Sul state) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Humid Forest (Atlantic Forest biome) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade; avoid direct harsh sun as it grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte under canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch of the substrate to dry slightly between waterings. High humidity is crucial, mimicking its native forest environment. |

## Introduction
Pleopeltis is a genus of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae, subfamily Polypodioideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). The genus widely distributed in tropical regions of the world, and also north into temperate regions in eastern North America and eastern Asia. Several species are known by the common name scaly polypody and resurrection fern.
The genus is closely related to Polypodium. Many of the species have been or sometimes are still included in that genus. Further changes in the circumscription of the genus may occur as research continues.
They are epiphytic, epipetric (growing on rocks), or rarely terrestrial ferns, with a creeping, densely hairy or scaly rhizome bearing fronds at intervals along its length. The fronds are evergreen, persisting for 1–2 years, and are entire or deeply pinnatifid. The sori or groups of spore-cases (sporangia) are borne on the back of the frond.

## Care Guide
This subtropical epiphyte thrives in conditions mimicking its native humid forest environment, requiring bright, indirect light and high humidity. Ensure consistent moisture by keeping the substrate moist but not waterlogged, allowing slight drying between waterings. Fertilize sparingly during the growing season to support healthy foliage.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a diluted liquid fertilizer, perhaps monthly. As an epiphyte, it obtains nutrients from decaying organic matter.
