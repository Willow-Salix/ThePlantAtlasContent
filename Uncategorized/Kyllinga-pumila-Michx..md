## Introduction
Kyllinga is genus of flowering plants in the sedge family known commonly as spikesedges. They are native to tropical and warm temperate areas of the world, especially tropical Africa. These sedges vary in morphology, growing to heights from 2.5 centimeters to a meter and sometimes lacking rhizomes. They are closely related to Cyperus species and sometimes treated as part of a more broadly circumscribed Cyperus.
The genus was named for the 17th century Danish botanist Peder Lauridsen Kylling.
Species include:

Kyllinga brevifolia
Kyllinga coriacea
Kyllinga erecta
Kyllinga exigua
Kyllinga gracillima
Kyllinga melanosperma
Kyllinga nemoralis
Kyllinga odorata
Kyllinga planiculmis
Kyllinga polyphylla

Kyllinga triceps
Kyllinga vaginata

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in conditions mimicking its native subtropical wetland habitat. It requires consistently moist to wet soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Provide moderate fertilization during its active growing period to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season; a balanced liquid fertilizer can support robust growth in typically nutrient-rich wetland soils.
