## 🧤 Care Instructions
French marigolds flourish in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring consistent moisture during their active growth but tolerant of brief dry periods. Moderate fertilization supports abundant blooming, and ensuring good air circulation helps prevent common issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced all-purpose fertilizer during the growing and blooming season, especially if soil is poor; avoid over-fertilization which can reduce blooms.
