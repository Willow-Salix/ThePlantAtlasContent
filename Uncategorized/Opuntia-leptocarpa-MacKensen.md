## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert Biome |
| **Sunlight** | High sun. Prefers full sun exposure for at least 6-8 hours daily, but can tolerate some partial shade, especially in extremely hot desert conditions. |
| **Watering** | Low. This drought-tolerant cactus requires infrequent, deep watering only after the soil has completely dried out. Significantly reduce watering during the cooler, dormant winter months. |

## Introduction
Opuntia, commonly called the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family Cactaceae, many known for their flavorful fruit and showy flowers. Cacti are native to the Americas, and are well adapted to arid climates; however, they are still vulnerable to alterations in precipitation and temperature driven by climate change. The plant has been introduced to Australia, southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.
Prickly pear alone is also used to refer to the fruit, but may also be used for the plant itself; in addition, other names given to the plant and its specific parts include tuna (fruit), sabra, sabbar, nopal (pads, plural nopales, from the Nahuatl word nōpalli), nostle (fruit) from the Nahuatl word nōchtli, and paddle cactus. The genus is named for the Ancient Greek city of Opus. The fruit and leaves are edible. The most common culinary species is the "Barbary fig" (Opuntia ficus-indica).
In places where they have been introduced outside their native range, some species in the genus Opuntia behave as aggressive invasive species.

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in abundant sunlight and well-draining soil, mimicking its arid native environment. Provide infrequent, deep watering, allowing complete drying between sessions, and very little to no fertilizer. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent any moisture-related issues.

### Fertilizer
Low. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted, balanced cactus-specific product once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer), or not at all if repotted annually with fresh potting mix.
