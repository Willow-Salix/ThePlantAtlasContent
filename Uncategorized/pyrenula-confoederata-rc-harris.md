## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions, including southeastern United States (e.g., Florida), Central and South America, and parts of Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to partial light, mimicking the dappled light conditions found on tree bark within a dense forest canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity and consistent ambient moisture are crucial. As a lichen, it absorbs water directly from the air and rain, requiring frequent wetting and drying cycles but never prolonged desiccation. Traditional watering in soil is not applicable. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pyrenula is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Pyrenulaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in tropical regions, and contains about 200 species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This 'wart lichen' thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical and subtropical moist forest habitat, requiring high humidity and low to partial light. It absorbs water and nutrients directly from the air and moisture, making consistent ambient humidity vital and rendering traditional soil-based care or fertilizers unsuitable.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer requirements; traditional fertilizers are typically harmful. Lichens derive necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and rain.
