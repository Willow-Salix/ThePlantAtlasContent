## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Puerto Rico |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest (Montane) |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial shade to bright, indirect light. Protect from direct sun, especially during the hottest parts of the day, as this can scorch its fronds. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil and high atmospheric humidity. Do not allow the soil to dry out between waterings; frequent watering is necessary, and consider misting or a pebble tray to maintain humidity. |

## Introduction
Cyathea is a genus of tree ferns, the type genus of the fern order Cyatheales.
The genus name Cyathea is derived from the Greek kyatheion, meaning "little cup", and refers to the cup-shaped sori on the underside of the fronds.
