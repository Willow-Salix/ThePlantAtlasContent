## 🌱 Overview
Ahtiana is a fungal genus in the family Parmeliaceae. A monotypic genus, it contains the single species Ahtiana sphaerosporella, the mountain candlewax lichen, found in western North America. The species was originally classified as Parmelia sphaerosporella by Johannes Müller Argoviensis in 1891, before Trevor Goward established the new genus Ahtiana in 1985, naming it after Finnish lichenologist Teuvo Ahti. This foliose lichen is characterised by its pale yellowish-green thallus, spherical spores, laminal apothecia (fruiting bodies), and the presence of usnic and caperatic acids. It primarily grows on the bark of whitebark pine in subalpine and montane regions, though it occasionally colonises other conifers outside its preferred host's range.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ahtiana aurescens thrives in cool, moist, high-altitude environments typical of western North American mountains. It requires high light exposure, significant atmospheric moisture from rain, fog, and dew, and does not need traditional fertilization. Mimicking these conditions, especially consistent atmospheric moisture and good air circulation, is crucial for its care.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed; obtains nutrients directly from the air and rainwater
