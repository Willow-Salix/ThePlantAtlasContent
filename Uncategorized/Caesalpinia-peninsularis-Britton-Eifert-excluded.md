## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant requires full sun and exceptionally well-draining soil to mimic its arid native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering once established. Minimal to no fertilization is necessary for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and over-fertilization can be detrimental. If desired, a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
