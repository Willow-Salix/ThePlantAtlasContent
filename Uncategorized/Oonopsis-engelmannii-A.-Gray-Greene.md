## Care Guide
Engelmann's False Goldenweed is a robust plant that demands full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its native semi-arid habitats. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and thrives in lean soils without the need for additional fertilizer, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny locations.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental; generally, no additional fertilizer is needed.
