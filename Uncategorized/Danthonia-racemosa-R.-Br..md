## Care Guide
This Australian native is a remarkably low-maintenance grass, highly tolerant of drought and thriving in full sun to partial shade. Provide well-drained soil and water deeply but infrequently once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Minimal fertilization is typically required for this adaptable species.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial in very poor soils, but is often not required.
