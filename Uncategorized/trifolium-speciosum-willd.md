## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean region, including Southern Europe (e.g., Iberian Peninsula, France, Italy, Greece) and North Africa |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, as it typically grows in open fields, pastures, and roadsides without significant canopy cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during its active growing season (typically winter and spring in its native range). It is drought-tolerant once established and can withstand dry conditions during summer dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Showy Clover thrives in full sun and is well-adapted to Mediterranean conditions. It requires moderate watering during its growth period, tolerating dry spells once established, and has low fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements, particularly for nitrogen, as it is a legume capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen through root nodules.
