## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | New Guinea (Papua New Guinea, West Papua) and surrounding islands in Melanesia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light; protect from direct, harsh sun, especially during midday, which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Keep substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged; allow the top inch or two to dry slightly between waterings. Requires high ambient humidity, benefiting from misting or a pebble tray. |

## Introduction
Dischidia is a genus of plants in the "dog-bane" family Apocynaceae, collectively known as the "milkweeds" (true perennial milkweeds in the Apocynaceae are found in the genus Asclepias). They are epiphytes, native to tropical areas of China, India as well as Bhutan’s southern borders, wherever minimal frost occurs. Additionally, they are known from most areas of Mainland Southeast Asia,  including forested areas of Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and some parts of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Several species are also native to Papua New Guinea, northeastern Australia, Mariana Islands and other Pacific islands.

## Care Guide
Hahl's Dischidia thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest habitat. Provide bright indirect light, high humidity, and consistent moisture, allowing the top layer of substrate to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize lightly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength, applied every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler months.
