| **Native Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical Asia (e.g., India, Southeast Asia, China), parts of Africa, and Oceania. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas, and Riparian Zones, often characterized by monsoon climates. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is ideal, reflecting its natural occurrence in open, exposed areas. |
| **Watering** | High. Prefers consistently moist soil, especially during warm growing seasons, mirroring its native habitats along riverbanks and floodplains. Can tolerate brief dry periods. |

## Introduction
Saccharum is a genus of tall perennial plants of the broomsedge tribe within the grass family.
The genus is widespread across tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions in Africa, Eurasia, Australia, the Americas, and assorted oceanic islands. Several species are cultivated and naturalized in areas outside their native habitats.
Saccharum includes the sugarcanes. They have stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are generally rich in sugar, and measure two to six m (6 to 19 ft) tall. All sugarcane species interbreed and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids.

## Care Guide
Wild Sugarcane thrives in full sun and requires abundant water, particularly during its warm growing season, due to its natural occurrence in moist riparian zones. Regular fertilization is beneficial to support its vigorous and rapid growth, maintaining robust health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Benefits from regular feeding with a balanced fertilizer during active growth to support its vigorous nature and rapid growth.
