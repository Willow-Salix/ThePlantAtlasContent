## Care Guide
Dorr's Cabin Jewelflower thrives in conditions mimicking its native Californian Mediterranean climate: full sun, well-draining soil, and minimal water, especially during summer dormancy. Avoid overwatering and heavy fertilization to ensure its health.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer requirements, as it's adapted to lean soils. A light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring is sufficient if growth appears weak.
