## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Southern California coast, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Coastal Scrubland (with significant fog influence and moist microclimates) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in open, sunny coastal environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to high. Requires consistent moisture during the growing season, especially in dry periods, mimicking its preference for moist slopes and areas with coastal fog. |

## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
The Coastal Red Indian Paintbrush thrives in full sun within a Mediterranean coastal scrubland, favoring moist conditions influenced by fog. Due to its hemiparasitic nature, it requires minimal to no direct fertilization, instead drawing nutrients from host plants. Successful cultivation often involves companion planting with appropriate native hosts.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. As a hemiparasite, it obtains nutrients from the roots of host plants and can be harmed by direct fertilization.
