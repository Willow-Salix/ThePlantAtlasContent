## Introduction
Bothriochloa is a common and widespread genus of plants in the grass family native to many countries on all inhabited continents and many islands. They are often called beardgrass, bluegrass or bluestem. Some species are invasive in areas where they have been introduced.
The etymology of the genus name Bothriochloa derives from the two ancient Greek words βοθρίον (bothríon), meaning "small pit or trench", and χλόη or χλόα (khlóa), meaning "new green shoot or blade of grass".
An specimens of Bothriochloa from Gooty Fort Hill, Andhra Pradesh, India was collected in December 2019 and identified as Bothriochloa ewartiana (Domin) C. E. Hubb. based on literature study and international correspondence with experts from Australia, Indonesia and Americas. This study adds an extended and disjunct distribution of a Far Eastern species in Asia from India.

## Care Guide
Cane Bluestem is a low-maintenance grass that thrives in full sun and semi-arid conditions. It requires infrequent, deep watering once established, tolerating drought and lean soils. Avoid overwatering and excessive fertilization to mimic its native grassland habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low, adapted to lean soils. Generally requires little to no fertilization, perhaps a light application in spring if growth is poor.
