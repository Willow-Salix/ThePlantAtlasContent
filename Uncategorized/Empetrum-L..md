## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions including Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, UK), North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska), and Northern Asia (e.g., Siberia), extending into alpine zones of more temperate regions. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra, Alpine Tundra, Boreal Forest margins and heathlands. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring cooler light conditions often found in high latitudes or higher altitudes. Tolerates direct exposure but not intense, scorching heat. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil, mimicking boggy or heathland conditions. Requires regular moisture, especially during growth periods, but dislikes stagnant water around its roots in warmer temperatures. |

## Introduction
Empetrum nigrum, the crowberry, black crowberry, mossberry, rockberry, or, in western Alaska, Labrador, etc., blackberry, is a flowering plant species in the heather family Ericaceae with a near circumboreal distribution in the Northern Hemisphere. The name of the plant comes from the combination of the Greek  for “upon a rock” (en = upon + petros = rock) and the Latin for black (niger).

## Care Guide
Crowberry thrives in cool, moist, and acidic conditions with exposure ranging from full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, making regular fertilization unnecessary. Replicate its native arctic and alpine habitats for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Over-fertilization can harm the plant.
