## Introduction
Bidens is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. The genus include roughly 230 species which are distributed worldwide. Despite their global distribution, the systematics and taxonomy of the genus has been described as complicated and unorganized. The common names beggarticks, black jack, burr marigolds, cobbler's pegs, Spanish needles, stickseeds, tickseeds and tickseed sunflowers refer to the fruits of the plants, most of which are bristly and barbed. The generic name refers to the same character; Bidens comes from the Latin bi ("two") and dens ("tooth").

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian variety needs bright light and consistent, moderate moisture with well-draining soil to replicate its native mesic forest edge environment. Provide a balanced fertilizer during active growth and ensure good air circulation to prevent issues.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula during its active growing season, consistent with nutrient availability in natural shrubland soils.
