## Introduction
Miscanthus, or silvergrass, is a genus of African, Eurasian, and Pacific Island plants in the grass family, Poaceae. The name is derived from the Greek words "miskos", meaning "stem", and "anthos", meaning "flower", in reference to the stalked spikelets on plants of this genus. Several species are known for their height and biomass production, and may be used as ornamental grasses.

## Care Guide
This ornamental grass prefers a location with full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular watering is beneficial, especially during dry spells, and a light annual fertilization supports healthy growth. It is relatively low maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can promote vigorous growth.
