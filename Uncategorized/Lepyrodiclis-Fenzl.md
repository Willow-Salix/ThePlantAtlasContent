## Care Guide
False Jagged Chickweed thrives in full sun conditions, much like its native steppe and semi-arid environments. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from low to moderate fertilization, primarily during its active growth period, reflecting its adaptability to less rich, disturbed soils.
