## 🧤 Care Instructions
Senecio murrayi thrives in conditions mimicking its native rocky, subalpine habitat in Iran, requiring full sun and exceptionally well-draining soil. Water moderately, allowing the substrate to dry thoroughly between applications, and fertilize very sparingly to support its growth without over-enriching.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly once during the growing season if needed.
