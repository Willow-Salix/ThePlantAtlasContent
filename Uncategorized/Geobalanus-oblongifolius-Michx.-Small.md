## Care Guide
Gopher Apple is a hardy, drought-tolerant groundcover native to the sandy soils of the Southeastern US. It thrives in full sun with minimal watering and fertilizer, making it an excellent, low-maintenance choice for warm, dry climates.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. If desired, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once annually in early spring.
