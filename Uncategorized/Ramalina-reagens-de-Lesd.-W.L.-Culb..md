## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in bright light and high humidity with ample air circulation, mimicking its native coastal or semi-arid environments. It requires no traditional watering or fertilization, deriving moisture from the air and nutrients from dust and rain, making it sensitive to pollutants.

### Fertilizer
None required; highly sensitive to nutrient pollution and traditional fertilizers, absorbing all needs directly from air and rain.
