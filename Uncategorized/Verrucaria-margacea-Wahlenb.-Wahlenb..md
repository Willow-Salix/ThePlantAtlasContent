## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Freshwater Aquatic (Temperate/Boreal) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. As an aquatic species, it thrives in submerged or partially shaded conditions within clear streams and rivers, protected from intense direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant submersion in cool, clean, oxygenated freshwater or very frequent wetting. The environment must consistently mimic a flowing stream or river. |

## Introduction
Verrucaria is a genus of lichenized (lichen-forming) fungi in the family Verrucariaceae. These lichens form crust-like growths on rocks, particularly limestone and other calcareous surfaces, though some species also grow on siliceous rock or occasionally on bark and soil. The genus includes both terrestrial species found in dry environments and marine species that can survive periodic flooding or permanent submersion in coastal and freshwater habitats. With about 150 accepted species worldwide, Verrucaria represents a challenging taxonomic group due to overlapping physical characteristics and the polyphyletic nature of the genus.

## Care Guide
To care for Wart Lichen, recreate its native aquatic environment by ensuring constant submersion in cool, clean freshwater with ample oxygenation. Provide low to moderate indirect light and strictly avoid any fertilizers, which are harmful to these unique organisms.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from the water and atmosphere; added fertilizers are detrimental and can promote algal blooms in aquatic setups.
