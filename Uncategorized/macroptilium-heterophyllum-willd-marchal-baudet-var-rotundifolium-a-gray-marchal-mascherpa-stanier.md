## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical/subtropical plant thrives in full to partial sun, similar to its open grassland origins. Water regularly during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and fertilize lightly. Adapt watering to its natural wet and dry cycles for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Benefits from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer applied every 4-6 weeks during the growing season. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen may not be necessary.
