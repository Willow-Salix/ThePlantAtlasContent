## Introduction
Spigelia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Loganiaceae. It contains around 60 species, distributed over the warmer parts of the Americas, from the latitude of Buenos Aires to the Southern United States. It was named after Adriaan van den Spiegel (Adrianus Spigelius) by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum; the type species is Spigelia anthelmia.

## Care Guide
Woodland Pinkroot flourishes in a shady, moist environment, mirroring its native temperate woodland floor. Ensure the soil remains consistently damp but well-drained and enrich it with organic matter. Protect it from intense direct sunlight to prevent leaf scorch.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from organically rich soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or regular amendment with compost, is sufficient.
