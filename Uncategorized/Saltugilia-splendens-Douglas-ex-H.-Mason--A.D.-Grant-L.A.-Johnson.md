## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Coastal Sage Scrub |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth and abundant flowering; tolerates very light partial shade, especially in hotter inland regions. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently and deeply during its active growing season (late winter through spring), allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings. Requires minimal to no water during its summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Saltugilia is a genus of flowering plants in the phlox family, Polemoniaceae. They are known commonly as woodland gilias. There are four species. Two are endemic to California in the United States, and the distributions of the other two extend into Baja California in Mexico.
This genus was erected in the year 2000 to segregate three species from the genus Gilia on the basis of phylogenetic evidence. Analysis of DNA was used in the formation of the new taxon, and studies of other characteristics of the plants, such as morphological, palynological, and ecological traits, were considered.  Saltugilia was a section of genus Gilia. These three species were classified in the new genus Saltugilia, and the fourth was newly described to science in 2001.

## Care Guide
This California native thrives in conditions mimicking its Mediterranean chaparral habitat, requiring abundant sun and excellent drainage. Water sparingly during its spring growth and flowering period, allowing for summer dormancy with very little water. It is a low-maintenance plant that generally does not need heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly in early spring, or it may not require any additional feeding in average garden soils.
