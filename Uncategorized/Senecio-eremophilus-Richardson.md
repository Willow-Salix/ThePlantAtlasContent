## Care Guide
Desert Ragwort is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate to infrequent watering. Fertilize sparingly to support healthy growth without over-enriching the soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season, particularly if grown in poor soil.
