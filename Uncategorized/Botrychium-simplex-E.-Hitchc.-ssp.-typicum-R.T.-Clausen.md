## Introduction
Botrychium is a genus of ferns, seedless vascular plants in the family Ophioglossaceae. Botrychium species are known as moonworts. They are small, with fleshy roots, and reproduce by spores shed into the air. One part of the leaf, the trophophore, is sterile and fernlike; the other, the sporophore, is fertile and carries the clusters of sporangia or spore cases.  Some species only occasionally emerge above ground and gain most of their nourishment from an association with mycorrhizal fungi.

## Care Guide
This small fern thrives in consistently moist, well-drained soil under partial shade to bright indirect light, mimicking its native habitat in temperate to boreal forest edges and moist meadows. Ensure good drainage and avoid direct sun, providing light fertilization during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength, or incorporate organic matter, sparingly during the active growing season.
