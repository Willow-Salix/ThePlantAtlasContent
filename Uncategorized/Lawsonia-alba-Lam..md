## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North Africa, Middle East, Indian subcontinent (e.g., India, Pakistan), parts of Southeast Asia, and Northern Australia. |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Tropical and Subtropical scrublands and dry forests. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. It thrives in high light intensity. |
| **Watering** | Water regularly during hot, dry periods or when actively growing, allowing the top soil to dry out between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established but appreciates consistent moisture without waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Henna is a dye made from dried, powdered leaves of Lawsonia inermis, producing reddish stains used in body art. It has been used since at least the ancient Egyptian period as a hair and body dye, notably in the temporary body art of mehndi (or "henna tattoo") resulting from the staining of the skin using dyes from the henna plant. After henna stains reach their peak colour, they hold for a few days and then gradually wear off by way of exfoliation, typically within one to three weeks.
Henna has been used in ancient Egypt, ancient Near East and the Indian subcontinent to dye skin, hair, and fingernails; as well as fabrics including silk, wool, and leather. Historically, henna was used in West Asia including the Arabian Peninsula and in Carthage, other parts of North Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, the Horn of Africa and the Indian subcontinent.
The name henna is used in other skin and hair dyes, such as black henna and neutral henna, neither of which is derived from the henna plant.

## Care Guide
Henna thrives in hot, sunny conditions, mirroring its native arid and semi-arid environments. It requires full direct sunlight and prefers well-draining soil that is kept consistently moist but not waterlogged during its active growth. This plant is relatively low-maintenance, needing only occasional fertilization and becoming drought-tolerant once established.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer), but it is not a heavy feeder.
