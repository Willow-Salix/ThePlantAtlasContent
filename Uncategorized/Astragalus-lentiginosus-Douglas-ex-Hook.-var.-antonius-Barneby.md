## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires very little water, perfectly suited for arid conditions. It needs well-draining, lean soil and generally does not require fertilizer, making it a low-maintenance option for dry, sunny gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes its own nitrogen. Native desert soils are typically poor; supplemental fertilizer is rarely needed.
