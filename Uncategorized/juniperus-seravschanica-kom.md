## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Asia (Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane Arid |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its native open, high-altitude slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water deeply but infrequently once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Junipers are coniferous trees and shrubs in the genus Juniperus ( joo-NIP-ər-əs) of the cypress family Cupressaceae. Depending on the taxonomy, between 50 and 67 species of junipers are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere as far south as tropical Africa, as far north as the Arctic, and parts of Asia and Central America. The highest-known juniper forest occurs at an altitude of 4,900 metres (16,100 ft) in southeastern Tibet and the northern Himalayas, creating one of the highest tree lines on earth.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Seravshan Juniper is a hardy, drought-tolerant conifer that thrives in full sun and well-draining, poor to average soils. Once established, it requires infrequent deep watering and generally does not need regular fertilization. This species is well-suited for arid or semi-arid climates and can tolerate cold winters and hot, dry summers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; generally does not require regular fertilization. If planted in very poor soil or showing slow growth, a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial.
