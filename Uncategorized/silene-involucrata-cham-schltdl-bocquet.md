## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions across North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada), Greenland, Europe (e.g., Scandinavia), and Asia (e.g., Siberia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is ideal, especially in cooler climates. Can tolerate partial sun, particularly where summer temperatures are high, to avoid scorching. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging, especially during the active growing season. Tolerant of short dry spells once established, but prefers steady moisture from snowmelt or rain. |

## 🌱 Overview
Silene is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. Containing nearly 900 species, it is the largest genus in the family. Common names include campion and catchfly. Many Silene species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Arctic Catchfly thrives in cold, sunny environments, demanding full sun and well-drained, consistently moist soil that mimics its native tundra. It is adapted to lean soils, needing minimal to no fertilization. Ensure good air circulation and protection from prolonged heat and humidity for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires very little to no fertilizer. Native to nutrient-poor tundra soils, an annual light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring, or none at all, is sufficient. Over-fertilization can harm the plant.
