## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (Peninsular and Transverse Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Chaparral and Cismontane Woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; tolerates full sun in coastal or cooler areas, prefers some afternoon shade in hotter inland regions. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires moderate watering during its winter/spring growing season, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce watering significantly or cease during dry summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## Care Guide
This Californian native thrives in Mediterranean conditions, requiring full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing regular watering only during its cooler growing season. Keep fertilization minimal to mimic its natural, less nutrient-rich habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adaptable to poor to moderately fertile soils. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, slow-release formula in early spring, or only if nutrient deficiency is observed.
