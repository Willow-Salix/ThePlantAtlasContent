## Care Guide
This aquatic liverwort thrives in consistently wet conditions with high humidity, mimicking its native stream habitats. Provide low to moderate indirect light and avoid nutrient-rich substrates, as it prefers minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. Nutrients are typically acquired from water. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
