## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (humid understory) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate, indirect light. Avoid direct harsh sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged. Requires high humidity; misting may be beneficial in dry indoor environments. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in a consistently moist, humid environment with low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native temperate forest understory. Avoid direct sunlight and ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues, as it typically does not require fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses are adapted to nutrient-poor substrates and generally do not require supplemental fertilization.
