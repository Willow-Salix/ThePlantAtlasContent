## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tall Oatgrass is a resilient temperate grass that prefers full sun to partial shade and moderate, consistent moisture. It is low-maintenance, thriving in average soils without significant fertilization, and can tolerate some drought once established. Avoid waterlogging to ensure healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not demanding. It can grow in average to poor soils without heavy fertilization but may benefit from a light, balanced fertilizer application in very infertile soils.
