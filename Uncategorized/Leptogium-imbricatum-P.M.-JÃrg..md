## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America (e.g., Costa Rica, Brazil, Colombia) |
| **Climate** | Tropical/Subtropical Humid Forests, often montane cloud forests or lowland rainforests |
| **Sunlight** | Low to indirect light; avoid direct, intense sunlight, which can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires very high humidity and consistent moisture. Frequent misting or placement in a high-humidity environment (like a terrarium) is crucial. Avoid drying out completely. |

## Introduction
Leptogium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Collemataceae. It has about 110 species. Species formerly classified under Leptogium have since been divided among the genera Leptogium, Pseudoleptogium, and Scytinium. Leptogium lichens are predominantly found on tree bark or soil, often among mosses, and sometimes on rocks in moist environments.

## Care Guide
This tropical lichen thrives in very high humidity and low, indirect light conditions, mimicking its native humid forest understory. Provide consistent moisture through frequent misting and ensure a humid environment, while strictly avoiding direct sunlight or any form of artificial fertilization.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens are sensitive to conventional fertilizers and obtain necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate.
