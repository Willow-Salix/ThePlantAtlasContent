## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, primarily the Intermountain West region of the USA (Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, California) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Shrubland/Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, ideally receiving at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to mimic its native open slope and sagebrush scrub environments. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce frequency significantly during cooler or dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## Care Guide
This clover thrives in well-draining soil and full to partial sun, reflecting its native montane shrubland and open forest habitats. It is very drought-tolerant once established and, as a legume, requires minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Provide moderate water, letting soil dry out, and ensure good light for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume. If needed, a low-nitrogen, balanced fertilizer can be applied very sparingly.
