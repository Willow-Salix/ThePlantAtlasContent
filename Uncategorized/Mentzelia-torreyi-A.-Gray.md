## Care Guide
Torrey's Blazingstar is a desert-adapted plant requiring full sun and very well-drained soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry completely, and avoid rich fertilizers to mimic its native arid habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; thrives in poor, rocky, or sandy soils and excess nutrients can be detrimental.
