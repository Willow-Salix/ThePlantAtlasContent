## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Not specifically documented for 'Allium zenobine Cory' in standard botanical references. Many Allium species originate from temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. |
| **Climate** | Not specifically documented for 'Allium zenobine Cory'. Allium species generally thrive in temperate to semi-arid climates with distinct seasonal changes. |
| **Sunlight** | Based on typical Allium species, it likely prefers full sun exposure to partial shade, requiring bright, open environments to flourish. |
| **Watering** | Consistent with other Allium species, moderate watering is needed during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It would likely be drought-tolerant once established, requiring reduced water during dormancy. |

## Introduction
Allium is a large genus of monocotyledonous flowering plants with around 1000 accepted species, making Allium the largest genus in the family Amaryllidaceae and among the largest plant genera in the world. Many of the species are edible, and some have a long history of cultivation and human consumption as a vegetable including the onion, garlic, scallions, shallots, leeks, and chives.
Allium species occur in temperate climates of the Northern Hemisphere, except for a few species occurring in Chile (such as A. juncifolium), Brazil (A. sellovianum), and tropical Africa (A. spathaceum). They vary in height between 5–150 centimetres (2–59 in). The flowers form an umbel at the top of a leafless stalk. The bulbs vary in size between species, from small (around 2–3 mm in diameter) to rather large (8–10 cm). Some species (such as Welsh onion A. fistulosum and leeks (A. ampeloprasum)) develop thickened leaf-bases rather than forming bulbs as such.
Carl Linnaeus first described the genus Allium in 1753. The generic name Allium is the Latin word for garlic, and the type species for the genus is Allium sativum which means "cultivated garlic". The decision to include a species in the genus Allium is taxonomically difficult, and species boundaries are unclear. Estimates of the number of species are as low as 260, and as high as 979. In the APG III classification system, Allium is placed in the family Amaryllidaceae, subfamily Allioideae (formerly the family Alliaceae).  In some of the older classification systems, Allium was placed in Liliaceae. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown this circumscription of Liliaceae is not monophyletic.

Various Allium species have been cultivated from the earliest times. About a dozen species are economically important as crops, or garden vegetables, and an increasing number of species are important as ornamental plants. Plants of the genus produce chemical compounds, mostly derived from cysteine sulfoxides, that give them a characteristic onion or garlic taste and odor. Many are used as food plants, though not all members of the genus are equally flavorful. In most cases, both bulb and leaves are edible. The characteristic Allium flavor depends on the sulfate content of the soil the plant grows in. In the rare occurrence of sulfur-free growth conditions, all Allium species completely lose their usual pungency.

## Care Guide
Specific care guidelines for Allium zenobine Cory are not available due to the obscurity of this name. Extrapolating from general Allium characteristics, it would likely require full sun, well-drained soil, and moderate watering during active growth, with minimal fertilization needs.

### Fertilizer
Allium species are generally not heavy feeders. A low to moderate application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, or enriching the soil with organic matter, should be sufficient.
