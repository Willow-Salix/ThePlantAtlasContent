## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient grassland plant thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native South American savannas. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and a balanced fertilizer can support growth during the active season, though it tolerates poorer soils well.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a general-purpose, balanced fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season. Thrives even in relatively poor soils.
