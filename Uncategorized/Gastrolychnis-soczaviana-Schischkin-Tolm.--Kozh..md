## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central Asia (e.g., Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan) |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers bright, unobstructed light typical of high-altitude open areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid consistently wet soil, as alpine plants are adapted to well-drained conditions. |

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in bright, open conditions with excellent drainage, mimicking its native rocky, well-drained slopes. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and prefers lean soils, making fertilizer largely unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. Excessive fertilization can lead to weak, leggy growth rather than robust flowering.
