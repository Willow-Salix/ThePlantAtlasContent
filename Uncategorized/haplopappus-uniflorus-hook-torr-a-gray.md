## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lyall's Goldenweed is a hardy alpine perennial that prefers full sun exposure and well-drained, lean soil. It requires moderate, consistent moisture during its growing season, but should not be waterlogged. Minimal fertilization is necessary, reflecting its adaptation to high-elevation, nutrient-scarce environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental. A very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring if growth seems weak.
