## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico (Oaxaca, Chiapas) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Montane Forest/Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it grows in open woodlands or scrub, indicating a need for good light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Reflecting its native montane scrubland environment with seasonal rainfall, allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Increase frequency during active growth, reduce during cooler or dormant periods. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Native to the subtropical montane forests and scrublands of Mexico, Viguiera longifolia thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and benefits from light fertilization during its active growing period.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate. Soils in subtropical montane scrublands are typically not overly rich. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season (spring and summer).
