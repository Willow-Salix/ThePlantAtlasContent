## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions reminiscent of its native temperate forest understory. Ensure consistently moist, well-draining soil and protect it from intense direct sun. Fertilize lightly with organic matter in spring.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, organic soil. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or organic compost annually in early spring to support vigorous growth.
