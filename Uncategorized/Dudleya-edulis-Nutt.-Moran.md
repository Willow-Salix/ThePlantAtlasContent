# Fingertips

*Dudleya edulis (Nutt.) Moran* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal Southern California (USA) and northern Baja California (Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland/Coastal Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun to partial sun. Prefers bright, direct sunlight for at least 6 hours daily, especially in cooler coastal areas, but can benefit from some afternoon shade in extremely hot inland regions. |
| **Watering** | Water sparingly, only when the soil is completely dry, typically once every 2-4 weeks during its active growing season (fall to spring). Withhold water almost entirely during its summer dormancy to prevent rot. |

## Introduction
"Fingertips" is a 1963 hit single recorded live by "Little" Stevie Wonder for Motown's then Tamla label.

## Care Guide
This Dudleya thrives in bright, direct sunlight with minimal watering, mimicking its arid coastal habitat. Ensure excellent drainage and water deeply but infrequently during its active fall-to-spring growth, avoiding water during its summer dormancy to prevent rot.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A diluted, balanced succulent fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (fall-spring), but it is not essential for healthy growth.
