## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Temperate Zones (e.g., North America, Europe), commonly found on exposed siliceous rocks. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal, characterized by periods of high exposure to sunlight and atmospheric moisture, followed by dry spells. |
| **Sunlight** | High direct sunlight to partial sun; thrives in exposed locations on rocks or other substrates. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular exposure to ambient moisture (rain, dew, high humidity) for hydration and nutrient absorption, followed by periods of drying; avoid constant submersion. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
This saxicolous lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions characteristic of temperate and boreal regions. It primarily obtains moisture and nutrients from the atmosphere, requiring regular exposure to humidity or rain followed by drying periods. Providing a suitable rocky substrate and mimicking its native light and moisture cycles is key to its care, as traditional watering and fertilizing are not applicable.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is necessary; lichens obtain all required nutrients directly from the atmosphere and their substrate.
