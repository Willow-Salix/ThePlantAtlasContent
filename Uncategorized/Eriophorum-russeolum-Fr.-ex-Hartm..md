## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia), northern Asia, and northern North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska, Greenland). |
| **Climate** | Boreal Wetlands/Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright indirect light is essential for robust growth, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to waterlogged soil conditions; it thrives in bog-like environments and should never be allowed to dry out. May tolerate standing water. |

## Introduction
Eriophorum (cottongrass, cotton-grass or cottonsedge) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae, the sedge family. They are found in the cool temperate, alpine, and Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, primarily in the middle latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia.

## Care Guide
Red Cottongrass needs full sun and perpetually wet, acidic soil to mimic its native bog and tundra environment. Ensure constant moisture, potentially by keeping roots submerged, and apply fertilizer very sparingly due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a highly diluted solution formulated for bog plants or acid-loving plants, as its native soils are typically nutrient-poor.
