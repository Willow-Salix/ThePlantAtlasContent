## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant requires full sun and excellent drainage, thriving in conditions similar to its high-altitude native habitat. Water moderately, ensuring the soil dries between waterings, and keep fertilizer to a minimum to avoid stressing the plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, with a highly diluted balanced formula.
