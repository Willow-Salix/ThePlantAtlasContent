| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical/Subtropical Montane Forests, characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons and high altitudes. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with its open forest habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is adapted to periods of drought and requires excellent drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
A pine is any conifer in the genus Pinus () of the family Pinaceae. Pinus is the sole genus in the subfamily Pinoideae. The species are evergreen trees or shrubs with their leaves in bunches, usually of 2 to 5 needles. The seeds are carried on woody cones, with two seeds to each cone scale.
Pines are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere; they occupy large areas of taiga (boreal forest), but are found in many habitats, including the Mediterranean Basin, and dry tropical forests in southeast Asia and Central America. Some are fire-resistant or fire-dependent. 
Pine trees provide one of the most extensively used types of timber. The seeds are used to make dishes such as pesto, while retsina wine is flavoured with pine resin.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ocote Chino thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its native montane habitat. It requires moderate watering with periods of dryness to mimic natural wet and dry seasons. Light fertilization supports its growth without over-enriching the soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization, especially during initial establishment or in poor soils. A balanced, slow-release conifer fertilizer can be applied annually in spring.
