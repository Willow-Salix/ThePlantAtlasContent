## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Valley and surrounding foothills of California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean climate; Arid Grassland/Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive in its open, dry native habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture during its active growth period in late winter and spring, mimicking natural rainfall. As an annual, it prefers dry conditions and is highly drought-tolerant once it begins to set seed in late spring and through the dry summer. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cordylanthus (lit. 'club-flower'), commonly known as bird's beaks, is a genus of parasitic plants in the broomrape family, Orobanchaceae. These western North American natives are sparse, weedy-looking annuals with long branching erect stems and little foliage, and many bear bird's-beak–shaped flowers. They are remarkable among the broomrapes for growing at searing temperatures in arid climates.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This annual plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, reflecting its Californian Mediterranean native habitat. Provide regular watering during its active growth in cooler, wetter months, then allow it to experience a dry period as it sets seed and completes its life cycle in hot summers. Avoid over-fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, well-draining soils and can be sensitive to rich soil conditions or excessive nutrients.
