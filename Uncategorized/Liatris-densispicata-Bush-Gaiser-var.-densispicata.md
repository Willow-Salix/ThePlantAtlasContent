## Introduction
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## Care Guide
Densespike Blazing Star thrives in full sun with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mirroring its native prairie and meadow habitats. It is adapted to average to lean soils, requiring minimal fertilization. Ensure adequate moisture and sunlight for robust growth and abundant blooms.
