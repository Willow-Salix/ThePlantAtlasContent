## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, primarily the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States (from southern Maine to Georgia, and west to Ohio and West Virginia). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest (often found in dry to mesic woodlands, clearings, and woodland edges). |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat of open woodlands and clearings, it typically receives 6+ hours of direct sunlight, but can tolerate some afternoon shade, especially in hotter regions. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, but is quite tolerant of drier conditions once established. Water regularly during prolonged dry spells, ensuring the soil doesn't become waterlogged. |

## Introduction
Eurybia spectabilis, commonly known as the eastern showy aster, simply showy aster or purple wood aster, is an herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is present along the coastal plain of the U.S. where it is most often found growing in dry, sandy soils. Although it is not considered threatened due to its extensive range, it is locally endangered in many states. The flowers appear in the fall and show ray florets that are a violet-purple and yellow disc florets. It is one of the parent species of the hybrid Eurybia × herveyi.

## Care Guide
The Eastern Showy Aster thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, though it tolerates some drought once established. Avoid overly rich soils as it prefers average fertility and benefits from only light fertilization. Ensure moderate watering during dry periods to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Native to soils that are typically average to lean in fertility, it benefits from a light application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, but avoids overly rich soil.
