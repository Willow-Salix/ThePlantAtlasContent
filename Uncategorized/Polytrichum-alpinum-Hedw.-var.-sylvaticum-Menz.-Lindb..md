## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including subalpine forests and woodlands of North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Boreal and Subalpine Woodland/Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade, avoid direct intense sun exposure, especially in warmer climates, as it typically grows on forest floors beneath a canopy. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial; the substrate should remain damp but not waterlogged. High ambient humidity is also essential for moss health, mirroring damp forest undergrowth. |

## Introduction
Polytrichum is a genus of mosses — commonly called haircap moss or hair moss — which contains approximately 70 species that have a cosmopolitan distribution.
The genus Polytrichum has a number of closely related sporophytic characters. The scientific name is derived from the Ancient Greek words polys, meaning "many", and thrix, meaning "hair". This name was used in ancient times to refer to plants with fine, hairlike parts, including mosses, but this application specifically refers to the hairy calyptras found on young sporophytes. A similar naming related to hair appears in Old Norse, haddr silfjar, "hair of Sif", goddess from Norse Mythology, wife of the god Thor. There are two major sections of Polytrichum species. The first — section Polytrichum — has narrow, toothed, and relatively erect leaf margins. The other — section Juniperifolia — has broad, entire,  and sharply inflexed leaf margins that enclose the lamellae on the upper leaf surface.

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, damp, shaded environments mimicking its native subalpine woodland habitat. Provide consistent moisture, high humidity, and protection from direct sunlight. Fertilization is generally not required, as mosses are not heavy feeders and prefer nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. Mosses derive nutrients from their environment; an occasional, highly diluted moss-specific feed or organic matter addition may be beneficial but is rarely critical.
