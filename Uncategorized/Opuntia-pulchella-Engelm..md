## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure for at least 6-8 hours daily to thrive, replicating its open desert habitat. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant; water very sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Opuntia, commonly called the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family Cactaceae, many known for their flavorful fruit and showy flowers. Cacti are native to the Americas, and are well adapted to arid climates; however, they are still vulnerable to alterations in precipitation and temperature driven by climate change. The plant has been introduced to Australia, southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.
Prickly pear alone is also used to refer to the fruit, but may also be used for the plant itself; in addition, other names given to the plant and its specific parts include tuna (fruit), sabra, sabbar, nopal (pads, plural nopales, from the Nahuatl word nōpalli), nostle (fruit) from the Nahuatl word nōchtli, and paddle cactus. The genus is named for the Ancient Greek city of Opus. The fruit and leaves are edible. The most common culinary species is the "Barbary fig" (Opuntia ficus-indica).
In places where they have been introduced outside their native range, some species in the genus Opuntia behave as aggressive invasive species.

## Care Guide
The Sand Prickly Pear thrives in conditions mimicking its arid native habitat, requiring abundant sunlight and very infrequent watering. It is highly drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, with minimal to no fertilizer necessary for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Has low nutrient needs. Fertilize infrequently with a balanced, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer during its active growing season (spring/summer), or not at all.
