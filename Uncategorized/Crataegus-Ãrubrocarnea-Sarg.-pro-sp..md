## Care Guide
Hawthorns thrive in temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. They require moderate watering, especially when young or during dry periods, and generally benefit from minimal fertilization in good soil to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially for young plants or those in poor soil. Established plants in good quality soil may need little to no additional fertilizer.
