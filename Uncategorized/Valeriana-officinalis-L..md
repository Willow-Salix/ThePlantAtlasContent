## Introduction
Valeriana is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae, members of which may be commonly known as valerians. It contains many species, including the garden valerian, Valeriana officinalis. Valeriana has centers of diversity in Eurasia and South America (especially in the Andes), and is represented by native species on all continents except Antarctica. 
Some species have been introduced to parts of the world outside their native range, including Valeriana rubra in the western United States and Valeriana macrosiphon in Western Australia.

## Care Guide
Garden Valerian thrives in temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Regular watering is crucial, particularly in dry weather, to emulate its native damp meadow habitats, and it benefits from moderate soil fertility.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; thrives in reasonably fertile, well-draining soils. A balanced organic fertilizer can be beneficial annually.
