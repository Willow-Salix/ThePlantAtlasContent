# Hassea Lichen

*Hassea Zahlbr.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland to Semi-Arid Desert |
| **Sunlight** | High light to full sun; can tolerate partial shade but prefers strong illumination. |
| **Watering** | Extremely infrequent. Moisture is primarily absorbed from atmospheric humidity, dew, or occasional rainfall. Avoid standing water; brief misting during prolonged dry spells may be beneficial. |

## Introduction
Sarcopyrenia is a genus of lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) fungi. It has 11 species. It is the only genus in Sarcopyreniaceae, a family in the order Verrucariales. Sarcopyreniaceae is one of the few families composed entirely of lichenicolous fungi. These tiny fungi produce small, black, flask-shaped fruiting bodies (perithecia) typically less than half a millimetre across, containing extremely narrow, thread-like ascospores. While they initially grow on crustose lichens, their fruiting bodies often outlast their hosts and end up sitting on bare rock, making their exact relationship with lichens somewhat unclear.

## Care Guide
Hassea lichens are highly resilient organisms adapted to arid environments, requiring abundant light and extremely infrequent moisture, often from atmospheric sources. They do not need conventional fertilizers. Replicating a dry, well-ventilated habitat with good light is crucial for their minimal care.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and their substrate; traditional fertilizers can be harmful.
