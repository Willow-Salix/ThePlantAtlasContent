| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Monsoon Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth. |

## Introduction
Millettia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of about 169 species of shrubs, lianas or trees, which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Indochina, southern China, Malesia, and New Guinea. Typical habitats include tropical rain forest and seasonally-dry lowland and upland forest and forest margins, woodland, thicket, wooded grassland, and secondary vegetation.

## Care Guide
The Millettia 'oiltree', native to tropical and subtropical Asia, thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistent watering during its active growth phase, tapering off during drier periods. Being a nitrogen-fixing plant, it benefits from moderate, balanced fertilization, with less emphasis on nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose formula during the growing season. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally does not require heavy nitrogen supplementation.
