## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate Eurasia and North America |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Open Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open, well-lit environments but can tolerate some afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. While tolerant of drought once established, regular watering that allows the topsoil to dry slightly between applications promotes optimal growth. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Festuca rubra is a species of grass known by the common name red fescue, creeping red fescue or the rush-leaf fescue. It is widespread across much of the Northern Hemisphere and can tolerate many habitats and climates. It is best adapted to well-drained soils in cool, temperate climates; it prefers shadier areas and is often planted for its shade tolerance. Wild animals browse it, but it has not been important for domestic forage due to low productivity and palatability. It is also an ornamental plant for gardens.

## Care Guide
Red Fescue is a hardy and adaptable grass that thrives in temperate conditions. Provide full sun to partial shade and moderate watering, allowing soil to dry slightly. It has low fertilizer needs, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, especially in poorer soils.
