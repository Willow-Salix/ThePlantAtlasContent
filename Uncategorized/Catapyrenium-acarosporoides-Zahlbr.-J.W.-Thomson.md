## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and semi-arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Western North America, Central and Northern Europe, and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Steppe, Arid Shrubland, and open Boreal Forest edges, often in exposed or partly shaded, disturbed ground. |
| **Sunlight** | High to Moderate Indirect Light; tolerates some direct morning or late afternoon sun in cooler conditions. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow the substrate to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid prolonged saturation, as it is adapted to periods of dryness. |

## Introduction
Catapyrenium is a genus of squamulose lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. These small lichens grow as clusters of tiny scales (squamules that lie flat against rocks and soil, often in dry or disturbed habitats. The genus includes about 18 species found worldwide, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions where they help stabilize soil surfaces.

## Care Guide
This earth lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate to semi-arid habitats. Provide high to moderate indirect light and allow its substrate to dry completely between infrequent waterings. Fertilization is not necessary, as lichens gather nutrients from the air and substrate.

### Fertilizer
Not required; lichens are slow-growing symbiotic organisms that obtain necessary nutrients from the atmosphere and the minerals present in their substrate.
