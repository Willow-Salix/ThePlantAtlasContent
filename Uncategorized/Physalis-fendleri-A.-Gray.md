| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-arid Shrublands and Grasslands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day for optimal growth and fruit production. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Physalis (, , , , from Ancient Greek: φυσαλλίς phusallís 'bladder') is a genus of approximately 75 to 90 flowering plants in the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which are native to the Americas and Australasia. At least 46 species are endemic to Mexico. Cultivated and weedy species have been introduced worldwide. A defining feature of Physalis is a large, papery husk derived from the calyx, which partly or fully encloses the fruit. Many species bear edible fruit, and some species are cultivated.
The typical Physalis fruit is similar to a firm tomato in texture, and like a sweet, tangy grape in flavor. Some species, such as the Cape gooseberry and tomatillo, have been bred into many cultivars with varying flavors, from tart to sweet to savory. Nations including Colombia, India, and Mexico have a significant economic trade in Physalis fruit. The fruits of many species are generically referred to as physalis, groundcherries, husk tomatoes, husk cherries, poha berries, and golden berries.

## Care Guide
Fendler's Groundcherry thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, adapted to its native arid and semi-arid environments. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent but deep watering and minimal fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer at the start of the growing season may be beneficial in very poor soils, but often not necessary.
