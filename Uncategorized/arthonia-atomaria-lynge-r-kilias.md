| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Boreal Forest (Taiga) margins |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect light to partial shade, avoiding direct, intense sunlight which can cause desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires high ambient humidity with occasional moisture from misting or atmospheric precipitation; tolerant of dry periods. No traditional watering of soil is needed as it absorbs water directly from the air. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cold, humid environments with indirect light, mimicking its native Arctic and Sub-Arctic habitats. It requires high atmospheric moisture with intermittent dry periods, obtaining all necessary nutrients from the air and its substrate without the need for traditional fertilizers or soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No conventional fertilizer is required. Lichens are self-sufficient, deriving trace nutrients from the atmosphere and their substrate.
