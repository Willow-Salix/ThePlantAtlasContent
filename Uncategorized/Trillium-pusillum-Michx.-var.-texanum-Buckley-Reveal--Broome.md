## Care Guide
The Texas Dwarf Trillium requires a shaded, consistently moist environment similar to its native woodland understory. Ensure well-draining, organically rich, acidic soil and protect it from harsh afternoon sun to support its delicate nature.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with organic matter or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring. Prefers naturally rich, acidic woodland soil.
