## 🌱 Overview
Maxillaria, abbreviated as Max in the horticultural trade, is a large genus of orchids (family Orchidaceae). This is a diverse genus, with very different morphological forms. Their characteristics can vary widely.
They are commonly called spider orchids, flame orchids or tiger orchids. Their scientific name is derived from the Latin word maxilla, meaning jawbone, reflecting on the column and the base of the lip of some species, that may evoke a protruding jaw.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical montane cloud forest habitat. Provide bright, indirect light, consistently moist conditions with high humidity, and regular diluted feeding during active growth. Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Apply a balanced orchid fertilizer at a diluted strength (e.g., quarter strength) every 2-4 weeks during active growth. Reduce frequency during dormant periods.
