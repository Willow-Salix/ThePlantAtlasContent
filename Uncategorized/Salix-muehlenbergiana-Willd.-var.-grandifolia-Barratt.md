## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This willow thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, replicating its native temperate wetland and riparian habitats. Ensure it receives full to partial sun exposure and moderate fertilization to support its robust growth. Consistent watering is paramount for its health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied in early spring, or a liquid feed throughout the growing season.
