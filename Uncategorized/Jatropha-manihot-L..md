## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Americas (e.g., Mexico, Central America, Caribbean) |
| **Climate** | Dry Tropical to Subtropical Scrubland or Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, needing at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Low; water deeply when the top inch of soil is dry, then allow it to dry out completely before the next watering. Highly drought-tolerant, reduce watering significantly in cooler or dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Jatropha is a genus of flowering plants in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. The name is derived from the Greek words ἰατρός (iatros), meaning "physician", and τροφή (trophe), meaning "nutrition", hence the common name physic nut. Another common name is nettlespurge. It contains approximately 180 species of succulent plants, shrubs and trees (some are deciduous, like Jatropha curcas). Most of these are native to the Americas, with 66 species found in the Old World. Plants produce separate male and female flowers. As with many members of the family Euphorbiaceae, Jatropha contains compounds that are highly toxic. Jatropha species have traditionally been used in basketmaking, tanning and dye production. In the 2000s, one species, Jatropha curcas, generated interest as an oil crop for biodiesel production and also medicinal importance when used as lamp oil; native Mexicans in the Veracruz area developed by selective breeding a Jatropha curcas variant lacking the toxic compounds, yielding a better income when used as source for biodiesel, because of its edible byproduct. Toxicity may return if edible Jatropha is pollinated by toxic types.

## Care Guide
This Jatropha species, originating from dry tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, thrives in full sun with minimal, infrequent watering due to its inherent drought tolerance. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot and fertilize sparingly, primarily during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season. Many Jatropha species tolerate poor soils and do not require heavy feeding.
