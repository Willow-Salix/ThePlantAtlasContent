| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including states like Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and parts of western Canada. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland, Montane Grasslands, Foothills |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflecting its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low; highly drought-tolerant and accustomed to dry conditions, requiring infrequent watering allowing the soil to dry out completely. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and very dry conditions, mirroring its native Western North American scrubland and grassland habitats. It requires minimal watering and well-draining, poor to moderate soil. As a hemiparasite, successful cultivation often necessitates a compatible host plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to moderate, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization is generally detrimental, especially given its hemiparasitic nature where it draws nutrients from host plants.
