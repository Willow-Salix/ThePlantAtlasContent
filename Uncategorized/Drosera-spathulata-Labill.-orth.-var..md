## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and various Pacific islands. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Wetlands and Montane Bogs. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sun daily) in humid conditions. Provide bright, unobstructed light for best growth and coloration. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently wet using the tray method with distilled water, rainwater, or reverse osmosis water. Never let the pot dry out, mimicking its natural boggy habitat. |

## Introduction
Drosera, which is  commonly known as the sundews, is one of the largest genera of carnivorous plants, with at least 194 species. These members of the family Droseraceae lure, capture, and digest insects using stalked mucilaginous glands covering their leaf surfaces. The insects are used to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which the plants grow. Various species, which vary greatly in size and form, are native to every continent except Antarctica.
Charles Darwin performed much of the early research into Drosera, engaging in a long series of experiments with Drosera rotundifolia, which were the first to confirm carnivory in plants.  In an 1860 letter, Darwin wrote, "...at the present moment, I care more about Drosera than the origin of all the species in the world".

## Care Guide
This sundew thrives in constantly moist, nutrient-poor, bog-like conditions with abundant sunlight. Use only distilled or rainwater, keeping the soil perpetually wet, and absolutely avoid conventional fertilizers as they are detrimental to its health.

### Fertilizer
Do not fertilize. Carnivorous plants obtain nutrients from insects; conventional fertilizers will burn their roots and are detrimental. If growing indoors without insects, occasional feeding of small insects or a highly diluted specialized carnivorous plant fertilizer may be considered, but generally isn't necessary.
