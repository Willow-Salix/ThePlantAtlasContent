## Care Guide
Mottlecah requires full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its native Mediterranean and semi-arid environment. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and prefers infrequent watering, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Native to nutrient-poor soils, it thrives without heavy fertilization. A light, slow-release native plant formula can be used sparingly if growth seems stunted.
