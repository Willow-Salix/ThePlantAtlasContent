## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico (specifically southern states like Oaxaca, Chiapas, Guerrero, and Jalisco) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest and Subtropical Scrubland (characterized by warm temperatures and distinct wet and dry seasons) |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (requires high light exposure, typical of its open native habitats). |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the active growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Drought tolerant once established, requiring significantly less water during dry or dormant periods. |

## Care Guide
The Oval Viguiera thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native tropical dry forest environment. It requires moderate watering during its growth phase, becoming quite drought tolerant in drier seasons. Fertilize lightly to moderately during active growth to support its development.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Avoid heavy fertilization.
