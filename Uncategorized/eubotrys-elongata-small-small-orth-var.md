## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant requires consistently moist to wet, acidic soil and thrives in dappled to partial sun conditions. It is crucial to prevent the soil from drying out, replicating its native boggy habitat. Fertilize lightly with an acid-specific formula to support vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with an acid-forming fertilizer, especially during its active growing season, as it thrives in acidic, often sandy soils.
