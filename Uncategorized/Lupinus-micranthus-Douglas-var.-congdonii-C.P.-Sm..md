## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean climate. Water moderately during its active growth period, reducing significantly as it approaches summer dormancy. Avoid nitrogen-rich fertilizers due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to no nitrogen fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. An all-purpose fertilizer balanced in phosphorus and potassium, applied sparingly if needed, is suitable for poor soils.
