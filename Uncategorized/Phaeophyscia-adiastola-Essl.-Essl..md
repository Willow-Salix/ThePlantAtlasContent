## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in North America, particularly the eastern and central United States, Canada, and parts of the Pacific Northwest. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (thriving in mesic to moist, often shaded microclimates within these forests). |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light. It naturally grows on tree bark, often under a canopy or on shaded sides, so direct sunlight should be avoided. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity is crucial. Lichens absorb moisture from their surroundings; regular misting or placement in a terrarium/humid environment is essential to keep it consistently moist without being waterlogged. |

## Introduction
Phaeophyscia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. These lichens typically appear as leaf-like (foliose) growths that spread across tree bark, rocks, or other surfaces, usually in well-lit, nutrient-rich environments. Their structure consists of short or long lobes that range in colour from pale grey to dark brown, becoming dark green when wet, and they often have dark undersides with root-like attachments (rhizines). The genus is distinguished from its relatives by its unique chemical composition and reproductive features, lacking a substance called atranorin and producing ellipsoidal spores. While some species reproduce through specialised propagules called soredia or isidia, others form small cup-like fruiting bodies (apothecia) on their surface for reproduction. There are over 50 known species of Phaeophyscia worldwide.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in high humidity and low to medium indirect light, mimicking its natural temperate forest habitat. It requires consistent moisture from its environment, often achieved through regular misting, and does not need traditional fertilizers which can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain nutrients from airborne particles and the substrate itself; conventional fertilizers can be harmful.
