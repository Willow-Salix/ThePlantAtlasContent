## Care Guide
This epiphyte thrives in conditions mimicking its native subtropical swamps: very high humidity, minimal direct light, and consistent moisture to its aerial roots. Provide excellent air circulation and apply extremely dilute fertilizer sparingly during growth phases to avoid nutrient burn.

### Fertilizer
Very dilute, balanced orchid fertilizer applied sparingly (e.g., 1/4 strength every 2-4 weeks during active growth). Nutrients are primarily absorbed from environmental debris.
