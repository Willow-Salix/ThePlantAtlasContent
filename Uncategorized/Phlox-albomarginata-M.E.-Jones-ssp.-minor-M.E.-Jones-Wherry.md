## Care Guide
This desert phlox thrives in hot, sunny conditions with excellent drainage. It requires minimal water, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between waterings, and has very low fertilizer needs, mimicking its native arid scrubland environment.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; prefers lean soils and may only require a light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, or none at all.
