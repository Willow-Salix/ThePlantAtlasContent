## Introduction
Blueberries are a widely distributed and widespread group of perennial flowering plants with blue or purple berries. They are classified in the section Cyanococcus within the genus Vaccinium. Commercial blueberries—both wild (lowbush) and cultivated (highbush)—are all native to North America. The highbush varieties were introduced into Europe during the 1930s.
Blueberries are usually prostrate shrubs that can vary in size from 10 centimeters (4 inches) to 4 meters (13 feet) in height. In the commercial production of blueberries, the species with small, pea-size berries growing on low-level bushes is known as "lowbush blueberries" (synonymous with "wild"), while the species with larger berries growing on taller, cultivated bushes is known as "highbush blueberries". Canada is the leading producer of lowbush blueberries, while the United States produces some 29% of the world's supply of highbush blueberries.

## Care Guide
Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure consistently moist, acidic soil conditions. Fertilize lightly with products designed for acid-loving plants to support healthy growth and fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Prefers highly acidic soil (pH 4.5-5.5) and benefits from light fertilization with specific acid-loving plant formulas; avoid high nitrogen or alkaline fertilizers.
