## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Alpine regions including Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia), North America (e.g., Greenland, Canada), and parts of Russia. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra / Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure, tolerating direct sun in cool conditions, typical of exposed rocky substrates above the treeline. |
| **Watering** | Absorbs moisture directly from air and precipitation (rain, snowmelt, fog). Requires periods of moisture followed by complete drying. Avoid constant saturation; infrequent misting or watering to simulate natural precipitation cycles is ideal. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cold, exposed, high-light environments, mirroring its arctic and alpine rocky habitats. It requires intermittent moisture, with periods of complete drying between hydration, and obtains sufficient nutrients from its environment without the need for additional fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer is required. Lichens are self-sufficient in nutrient acquisition from air, rain, and the substrate itself.
