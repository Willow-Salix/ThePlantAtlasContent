## Care Guide
Thriving in tropical full sun conditions, Wild Jute requires regular, consistent watering during its active growth period, mimicking monsoon rainfall. It generally adapts well to average, well-drained soils but will benefit from moderate fertilization to support vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertility. A balanced, general-purpose fertilizer applied during the active growing season is sufficient, as it often grows in average to disturbed soils.
