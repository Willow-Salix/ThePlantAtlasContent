## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gambel's Yellowcress thrives in consistently moist to wet soil under full to partial sun, essential for mimicking its native arid riparian zones. Frequent watering is critical as this plant requires constant moisture and will not tolerate dry conditions. Provide low to moderate fertilization to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; while it benefits from nutrient flow in its native wet environments, it is not typically a heavy feeder. A dilute, balanced fertilizer can be used if soil is poor.
