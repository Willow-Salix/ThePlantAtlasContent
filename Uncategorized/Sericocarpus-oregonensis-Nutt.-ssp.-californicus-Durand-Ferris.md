## Care Guide
This California native thrives in conditions mimicking its Mediterranean origin, requiring full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. It needs moderate watering but is drought-tolerant once established, making it a low-maintenance plant. Minimal fertilization is typically required for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It adapts well to nutrient-poor soils; an annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if needed.
