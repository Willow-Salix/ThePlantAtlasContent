| **Native Origin** | Alaska, Yukon, British Columbia, and parts of northern Canada |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra/Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, reflecting its exposure in open alpine meadows and slopes. |

## Introduction
Anemone () is a genus of flowering plants in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae. Plants of the genus are commonly called windflowers. They are native to the temperate and subtropical regions of all regions except Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica. The genus is closely related to several other genera including Anemonoides, Anemonastrum,  Hepatica, and Pulsatilla. Some botanists include these genera within Anemone.

## Care Guide
The Alaska Anemone thrives in cool, well-drained conditions, mimicking its native alpine habitat. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure consistently moist, but never waterlogged, soil, particularly during its active growth period. Fertilizer should be minimal, reflecting the nutrient-poor soils of its native range.

### Fertilizer
Low; alpine soils are generally not rich. A light, balanced fertilizer once in spring is sufficient, or none if soil is naturally fertile.
