## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Canadian Arctic Archipelago (e.g., Queen Elizabeth Islands), possibly Greenland |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, exposed areas typical of arctic environments, receiving long daylight hours with low light intensity during its short growing season. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial during the short summer growing season, as it often grows in areas with meltwater and poorly drained soils. Tolerant of wet conditions but not prolonged drought. |

## Introduction
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## Care Guide
Festuca edlundiae requires extremely cold temperatures and consistent moisture during its brief growing season. It thrives in nutrient-poor, often poorly drained soils typical of the Arctic Tundra. Provide full to partial sun, acknowledging the low intensity of arctic light, and avoid heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor tundra soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental and is generally unnecessary.
