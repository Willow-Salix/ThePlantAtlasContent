# Sarmenthypnum Moss

*Sarmenthypnum Tuom. & T. Kop.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Boreal and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Fennoscandia, Russia, Canada, and Alaska. |
| **Climate** | Boreal/Subarctic Wetland (fens, bogs) |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect to moderate light; tolerates partial shade to partial sun, but needs protection from intense, direct sun to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist to wet; requires high humidity and should never be allowed to dry out, mimicking its native bog/fen environment. |

## Care Guide
Sarmenthypnum moss requires consistently wet, high-humidity conditions with indirect to moderate light, replicating its cool boreal wetland habitat. Ensure the substrate never dries out and avoid intense direct sun. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it's adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses from nutrient-poor wetland environments do not require significant fertilization, and excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
