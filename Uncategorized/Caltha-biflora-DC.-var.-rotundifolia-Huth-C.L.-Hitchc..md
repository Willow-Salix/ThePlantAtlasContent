## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine and Alpine Wet Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating more sun in cooler climates or with abundant moisture. |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to very moist soil; requires constant moisture and does not tolerate drying out, thriving in boggy or perpetually damp conditions. |

## Introduction
Caltha is a genus of rhizomatous perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae ("buttercup family"), to which ten species have been assigned. They occur in moist environments in temperate and cold regions of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Their leaves are generally heart-shaped or kidney-shaped, or are characteristically diplophyllous (the auricles of the leaf blades form distinctly inflexed appendages). Flowers are star shaped and mostly yellow to white. True petals and nectaries are missing but the five or more sepals are distinctly colored. As usual in the buttercup family there is a circle of stamens around (two to twenty-five) free carpels.

## Care Guide
Thriving in cool, consistently wet conditions, this plant mimics its native subalpine and alpine wet meadow habitats. It requires full sun to partial shade and soil rich in organic matter, never allowing it to dry out. Provide light fertilization if the soil naturally lacks nutrients to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to rich in organic matter; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied lightly in spring if soil is naturally poor.
