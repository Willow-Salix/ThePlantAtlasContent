## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Europe (Mediterranean Basin, e.g., Italy, Greece, Balkan Peninsula) and Western Asia (Turkey, Caucasus) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands, and Scrub (Temperate, with hot dry summers and mild wet winters) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers some afternoon shade in regions with intense summer heat to prevent bolting. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture during its active growth period in spring, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Requires reduced watering as it enters dormancy or completes its lifecycle in late summer. |

## Introduction
Anthriscus (chervils) is a common plant genus of the family Apiaceae, growing in Europe and temperate parts of Asia. It comprises 15 species. The genus grows in meadows and verges on slightly wet porous soils. One species, Anthriscus cerefolium is cultivated and used in the kitchen to flavor foods.
Anthriscus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the mouse moth (recorded on cow parsley).
The hollow stem is erect and branched, ending in compound umbels of small white or greenish flowers. The leaves are bipinnate or tripinnate.

## Care Guide
Long-beaked Chervil thrives in conditions similar to its Mediterranean native habitat, preferring full sun to partial shade and moist, well-draining soil during its active spring growth. It requires consistent watering and light fertilization in its growing phase, adapting to drier conditions as it approaches its annual dormancy or seed production in summer.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during its active growing season, typically with a balanced all-purpose fertilizer. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it is not a heavy feeder.
