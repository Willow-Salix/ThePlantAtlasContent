## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic-alpine and montane regions across Europe (e.g., Alps, Scandinavia, UK) and North America (e.g., Greenland, Arctic Canada, Alaska, western US mountains) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, Montane Cold |
| **☀️ Light** | High light; thrives in exposed conditions and is tolerant of direct sun due to its habitat on open rock faces. |
| **💧 Water** | Intermittent moisture from rainfall, snowmelt, or dew, followed by periods of dryness; highly tolerant of desiccation and capable of absorbing water directly from the atmosphere. |

## 🌱 Overview
Schaereria is a genus of lichen-forming fungi. It is the sole genus in the family Schaereriaceae, which itself is the only family in the Schaereriales, an order in the subclass Ostropomycetidae of the class Lecanoromycetes. Most Schaereria species are crustose lichens that live on rocks. Schaereria was first proposed by Gustav Wilhelm Körber in 1855 and was later taken up by other lichenologists despite periods of disuse.
Distinctive characteristics of species in the Schaereria genus include a crustose to squamulose thallus, ascomata (fruiting bodies) with a blackened ring and a blackish disk, and asci (spore-bearing cells) that lack tholus (a thickened part of the inner wall near the tip). The secondary chemistry of the genus produces specific substances, including the pigment known as Cinereorufa-green in Schaereria cinereorufa. The genus, having a cosmopolitan distribution, primarily favours cold to cool climates of the Northern Hemisphere. However, certain species have been identified in both polar regions and others in warmer locales like Queensland (Australia). Schaereria species often grow on siliceous rocks, with a few variants being epiphytic (plant-dwelling) or even lichen-dwelling. Various lichenicolous fungi and lichens have been observed to grow on Schaereria species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Schaereria tenebrosa is a saxicolous lichen adapted to harsh arctic-alpine and montane environments. It requires high, exposed light conditions and tolerates significant desiccation, absorbing moisture directly from environmental humidity or precipitation. This organism does not need traditional fertilization, deriving nutrients from its surroundings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required; obtains necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, dissolved minerals in precipitation) and minerals leached from its rock substrate.
