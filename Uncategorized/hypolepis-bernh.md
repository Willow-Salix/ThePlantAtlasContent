## 🧤 Care Instructions
Beadferns thrive in conditions that mimic their native forest floor habitat: consistently moist soil, high humidity, and dappled shade. Protect from direct sun and provide regular, but not excessive, fertilization during growth. Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength, every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Reduce or cease in winter.
