## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry to Mesic Shrubland and Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, especially thriving in open, exposed areas typical of pioneer species. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings; tolerant of some drought once established due to its presence in drier forest and shrubland environments. |

## Introduction
Leptecophylla tameiameiae, known as pūkiawe or maiele in the Hawaiian language, is a species of flowering plant that is native to the Hawaiian and Marquesas Islands. 
The specific epithet honors King Kamehameha I, who formed the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. It grows as a tree up to 4.6 m (15 ft) tall in forests and as a shrub 0.9–3 m (3.0–9.8 ft) in height elsewhere.  Its small needle-like leaves are whitish underneath, dark green above.  The round berries range in color from white through shades of pink to red. Pūkiawe is found in a variety of habitats in Hawaii at elevations of 15–3,230 m (49–10,597 ft), including mixed mesic forests, wet forests, bogs, and alpine shrublands.

## Care Guide
Pukiawe is a robust Hawaiian native that prefers full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering, tolerating dry periods once established, and thrives with minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to lean, volcanic soils.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs, as it is adapted to often nutrient-poor volcanic soils. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth appears weak.
