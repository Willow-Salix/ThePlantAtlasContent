## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Australia, New Zealand |
| **Climate** | Temperate to semi-arid rocky outcrops and open woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright indirect light, as it naturally grows on exposed rocks. |
| **Watering** | Occasional wetting or misting, allowing for complete drying out between applications. Lichens absorb water directly and tolerate dry periods. |

## Introduction
Xanthoparmelia (commonly known as green rock shields or rock-shield lichens) is a genus of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. This genus of lichen is commonly found in the United States, South America, southern Africa, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
The name means 'golden yellow parmelia'. The photobiont (photosynthetic partner) is Trebouxia (a genus of green algae).

## Care Guide
This rock-dwelling lichen thrives in high light conditions. It requires occasional wetting or misting, followed by complete drying out periods, mimicking natural rain cycles. Avoid traditional fertilizers, as lichens are highly sensitive to excess nutrients and absorb what they need from the environment.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens are extremely sensitive to excess nutrients and obtain what they need from air and rainwater.
