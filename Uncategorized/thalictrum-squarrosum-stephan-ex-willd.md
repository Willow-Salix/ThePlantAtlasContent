## 🌱 Overview
Thalictrum ( ) is a genus of 120-200 species of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae, native mostly to temperate regions. Meadow-rue is a common name for plants in this genus.
Thalictrum is a taxonomically difficult genus with poorly understood species boundaries; it is in need of further taxonomic and field research for clarification.
Despite their common name of "meadow-rue", Thalictrum species are not closely related to the true rue (family Rutaceae), but resemble its members in having compound leaves twice or thrice divided.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This perennial thrives in cool, moist, temperate conditions, preferring partial shade to full sun with consistently damp soil. Provide regular watering and a light spring fertilization to encourage healthy growth and prevent stress during dry periods.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or compost in early spring is sufficient. Avoid over-fertilizing.
