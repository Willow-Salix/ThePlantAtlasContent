## Care Guide
Searsia thrives in bright light and prefers well-draining soil that dries out between waterings, reflecting its native arid to semi-arid environments. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant requiring minimal fertilizer and attention once established.

### Fertilizer
Low; apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly in spring, or not at all if planted in reasonably fertile soil, as native soils are not overly rich.
