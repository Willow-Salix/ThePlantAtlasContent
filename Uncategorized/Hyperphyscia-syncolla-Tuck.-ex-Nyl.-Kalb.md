## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of Eastern and Central North America (USA, Canada) and parts of Europe. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to filtered sunlight, mimicking the dappled light found under a forest canopy. Avoid direct, harsh sun which can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and regular exposure to moisture from rain or heavy dew. It absorbs water directly from the air and surfaces, not from soil; traditional watering is not applicable. |

## Introduction
Hyperphyscia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. These lichens form tightly attached, leaf-like crusts that spread outward in rosettes, with individual lobes radiating in shallow, overlapping tiers that are seldom more than a millimetre or two wide and range in colour from pale brownish-grey to dark brown. They reproduce through brown, disc-shaped fruiting bodies that sit directly on the upper surface and contain thick-walled brown ascospores divided by a single cross-wall, typical of many members of their family.

## Care Guide
Hyperphyscia lichen thrives in humid, temperate forest conditions, requiring consistent high humidity and filtered sunlight. As a lichen, it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air, making traditional watering and fertilization unnecessary and potentially harmful to its delicate structure.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens are self-sufficient, obtaining all necessary nutrients from the air, rain, and minute particles in their environment. Applying fertilizer is detrimental.
