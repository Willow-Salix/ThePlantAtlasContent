## Care Guide
The Jumping Cholla thrives in conditions mimicking its arid desert home, demanding full sun and very infrequent, deep watering. It requires minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils. This plant is a low-maintenance choice for hot, dry environments.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; apply a balanced, diluted cactus fertilizer sparingly during the active growing season (spring/summer), reflecting the nutrient-poor desert soils.
