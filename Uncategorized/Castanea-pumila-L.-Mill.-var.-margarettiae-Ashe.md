## Introduction
Castanea pumila, commonly known as the Allegheny chinquapin, American chinquapin (from the Powhatan) or dwarf chestnut, is a species of chestnut native to the southeastern United States. The native range is from Massachusetts and New York to Maryland and extreme southern New Jersey and southeast Pennsylvania south to central Florida, west to eastern Texas, and north to southern Missouri and Kentucky. The plant's habitat is dry sandy and rocky uplands and ridges mixed with oak and hickory to 1000 m elevation. It grows best on well-drained soils in full sun or partial shade. Allegheny chinquapin is relatively resistant to chestnut blight compared to the closely-related American chestnut.

## Care Guide
This Chinkapin variety thrives in its native southeastern US climate, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistent moisture with good drainage. Plant in moderately rich soil, mimicking its deciduous forest habitat, and fertilize annually for robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Prefers moderately rich, well-drained soil; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied annually in early spring, especially for young plants or in poor soils.
