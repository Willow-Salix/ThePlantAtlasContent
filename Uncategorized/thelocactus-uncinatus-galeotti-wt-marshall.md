## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in abundant sunlight and requires infrequent watering, allowing its soil to dry completely. Provide well-draining soil and a lean feeding schedule during its active growth to mimic its arid native habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization. Use a low-nitrogen, high-potassium cactus fertilizer diluted to half strength once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
