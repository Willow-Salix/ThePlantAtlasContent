## Care Guide
Nuttall's Linanthus thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions, mirroring its native Mediterranean and dry temperate habitats. Provide moderate water during its active spring growth, then significantly reduce watering as it enters summer dormancy to prevent rot. This plant prefers lean soils and requires minimal fertilization for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary, but a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be applied if growth seems sluggish.
