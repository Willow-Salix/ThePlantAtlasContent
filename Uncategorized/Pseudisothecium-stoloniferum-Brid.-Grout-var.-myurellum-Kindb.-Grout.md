# Slender Sprawling Moss

*Pseudisothecium stoloniferum (Brid.) Grout var. myurellum (Kindb.) Grout* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pacific Northwest of North America (e.g., coastal British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Northern California) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforest/Coastal Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. It grows on tree trunks and forest floors, indicating a preference for filtered or dappled light. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is critical; the substrate should always be damp but not waterlogged. High humidity is essential, requiring frequent misting or a terrarium environment. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate rainforest environment. Provide consistently moist, high-humidity conditions with low to moderate indirect light. Fertilization is typically unnecessary, as over-fertilization can be harmful.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses acquire most of their nutrients from rainwater and decaying organic matter in their environment.
