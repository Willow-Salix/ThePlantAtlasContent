## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (e.g., Eastern Canada, Northeastern and Appalachian regions of USA) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest, Boreal Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to bright indirect light. As an epiphyte or lithophyte, it's typically found on tree trunks or rocks, often in the forest understory, protected from harsh direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture and high humidity are crucial. Mimic frequent rainfall or dew; keep substrate moist but not waterlogged. Benefits from regular misting or placement in a terrarium/humid environment. |

## Introduction
Ulota is a genus of mosses comprising 69 species with a worldwide distribution, though most species are found in the southern hemisphere.
They have commonly been grouped within the genus Orthotrichum, though recently they have been placed in their own genus. Their phylogeny and taxonomy have been an area of debate ever since they were placed in their own genus, though it has been largely accepted to place Ulota as a genus of their own. They can be found growing on trees close to the coast, though some species are also found on rocks. Their shoots form small tufts to large mats across habitats, often intertwined with other mosses, including Orthotrichum species.
Ulota reproduce using sexual structures, sporangium (plural: sporangia), that are terminal on the shoot. The calyptra covering the developing sporangium can be hairy or not hairy depending on the species, but the hairs extend from the sporangium base to the apex as opposed to the calyptra hairs of Polytrichum mosses which extend from the apex to the base.

## Care Guide
Ulota americana thrives in a cool, humid environment with consistent moisture and dappled light, mimicking its native temperate forest habitat. It requires high humidity and regular watering but minimal to no fertilization. Focus on creating a stable, moist atmosphere rather than nutrient-rich feeding.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. Mosses absorb nutrients from rainwater and air; over-fertilizing can be harmful. If desired, a highly diluted (1/8 strength) liquid fertilizer can be applied very sparingly once or twice a year.
