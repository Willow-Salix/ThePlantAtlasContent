## Care Guide
Dasynotus I.M. Johnst. thrives in full sun and well-draining soils, mimicking its native Western USA habitat. Water moderately during the growing season, allowing soil to dry between waterings, as it is drought-tolerant once established. Minimal fertilization is typically needed to maintain its health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring is generally sufficient, or may not be needed at all.
