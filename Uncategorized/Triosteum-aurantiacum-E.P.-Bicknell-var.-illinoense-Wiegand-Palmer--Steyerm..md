## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern United States |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to dappled sunlight, replicating its natural woodland understory or forest edge habitat. Avoid intense, direct full sun. |
| **Watering** | Regular and consistent moisture is preferred, mimicking the moderate rainfall of its native habitat. Ensure soil remains consistently damp but not waterlogged, especially during dry periods. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
To care for Illinois horse-gentian, provide partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil rich in organic matter. Ensure regular watering, especially when rainfall is scarce, and apply a moderate fertilizer in spring. This will mimic its preferred temperate woodland environment.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Benefits from rich, organic soil. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or compost amendment once in spring can be beneficial, but heavy feeding is not typically required.
