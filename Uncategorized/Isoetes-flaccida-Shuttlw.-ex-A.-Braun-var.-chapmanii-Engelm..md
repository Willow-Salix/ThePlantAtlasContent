## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida, Georgia, and Alabama) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. In its native habitat, it grows in open, shallow waters, receiving direct sunlight. When cultivated, bright indirect light to several hours of direct morning sun is ideal. |
| **Watering** | This plant is aquatic or semi-aquatic, requiring constant submergence in shallow water or extremely wet, boggy soil conditions. It has no tolerance for drying out and must remain consistently saturated. |

## Introduction
Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of lycopod. It is the only living genus in the family Isoetaceae and order Isoetales. As of 2016, there were about 200 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution mostly in aquatic habitats but with the individual species often scarce to rare. Species virtually identical to modern quillworts have existed since the Jurassic epoch, though the timing of the origin of modern Isoetes is subject to considerable uncertainty.
The name of the genus may also be spelled Isoëtes. The diaeresis (two dots over the e) indicates that the o and the e are to be pronounced in two distinct syllables. Including this in print is optional; either spelling (Isoetes or Isoëtes) is correct.

## Care Guide
Chapman's Quillwort is an aquatic plant native to subtropical wetlands of the southeastern U.S., requiring full to partial sun. It must be kept consistently submerged in shallow water or in a very boggy, saturated substrate and cannot tolerate drying out. Provide low to moderate aquatic plant fertilization to ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As an aquatic plant, it primarily absorbs nutrients from the water column and substrate. Over-fertilization can encourage algae. Use aquatic plant fertilizers or root tabs sparingly, perhaps every few months.
