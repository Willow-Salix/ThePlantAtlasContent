## Care Guide
Schott's Stickpea, native to arid scrublands, thrives in full sun and requires infrequent watering due to its drought tolerance. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic its natural dry environment. It has very low fertilizer requirements, benefitting from a lean nutrient profile.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. If needed, a light application of a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
