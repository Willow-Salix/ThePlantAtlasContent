## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical / Temperate Deciduous Forest (moist, shaded understory) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade; requires protection from direct, intense sunlight which can scorch fronds. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist; native habitat in swamps and stream banks indicates a high need for moisture and high humidity. Do not allow soil to dry out completely. |

## Introduction
The moth genus Dryopteris is now considered a junior synonym of Oreta.

Dryopteris , commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to Dryopteris filix-mas), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales.
Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American Dryopteris hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization.
The fossil record of this genus shows that it was widespread even as far back as the Cretaceous with fossils being found in Late Cretaceous rock layers from North America down to Antarctica.

## Care Guide
The Southern Woodfern thrives in consistently moist, shaded conditions, mirroring its native forest understory habitat. Provide ample humidity and regular watering, ensuring the soil never dries out completely, while protecting it from direct sun and heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding; ferns generally do not require heavy fertilization. Use a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly once or twice during the growing season, or enrich soil with organic matter.
