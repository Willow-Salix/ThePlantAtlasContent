## Care Guide
Matted Starwort thrives in cool, exposed conditions with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide full to partial sun and avoid rich, heavily fertilized growing mediums. It requires minimal fertilization to mimic its natural, nutrient-poor tundra environment.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in nutrient-poor soils; a very light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, or none if planted in a suitable medium.
