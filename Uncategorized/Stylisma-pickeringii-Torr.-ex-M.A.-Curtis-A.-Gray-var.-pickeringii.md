## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Southeastern United States (e.g., New Jersey, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Pine Barrens and Dry Sandhills |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Thrives in very well-drained, sandy soils and is highly drought-tolerant. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Stylisma is a genus of flowering plants in the morning glory family, commonly known as dawnflowers. This genus is native to the eastern United States.
This genus consists of low vining or trailing herbs. They are found primarily in the Southeastern Coastal Plain in sandy habitats. However one species, Stylisma pickeringii, extends into the Midwest.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant perennial thrives in full sun and very well-drained, sandy soils, characteristic of its pine barren native habitat. It requires minimal watering once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and prefers nutrient-poor conditions, making heavy fertilization unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, using a low-dose, balanced fertilizer primarily during establishment or if signs of nutrient deficiency appear.
