## Care Guide
The Arctic Poppy thrives in conditions that mimic its native tundra, requiring full sun exposure and very well-drained soil. Water moderately, ensuring the soil doesn't become waterlogged, and fertilize sparingly as it's adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low, as its native tundra soils are typically poor in nutrients and organic matter.
