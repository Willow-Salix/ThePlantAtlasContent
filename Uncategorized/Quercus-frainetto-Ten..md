## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern Europe (Balkan Peninsula, Southern Italy) and Anatolia (Turkey) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Forest and Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and health, as it typically grows in open woodlands. |
| **Watering** | Young trees require moderate, consistent watering, especially during dry periods, to establish their root system. Mature trees are highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering and relying mostly on natural rainfall, reflecting their adaptation to hot, dry summers. |

## Introduction
Quercus pubescens (synonyms virgiliana), commonly known as the downy oak, pubescent oak or Italian oak, is a species of white oak (genus Quercus sect. Quercus) native to southern Europe and southwest Asia. It is found from northern Spain (Pyrenees) and France in the West to Turkey and the Caucasus in the East.

## Care Guide
The Italian Oak thrives in full sun, reflecting its natural habitat in open woodlands. Once established, it is remarkably drought-tolerant, requiring minimal supplemental watering beyond natural rainfall. Fertilization is generally low-demand for mature specimens, focusing more on healthy soil structure.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Established trees generally do not require regular fertilization in suitable soils. Young trees may benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season to aid establishment.
