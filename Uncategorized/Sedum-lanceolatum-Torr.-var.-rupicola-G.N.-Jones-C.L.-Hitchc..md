## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (including the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Montane to Subalpine Semi-Arid |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, with full sun promoting the best growth and flowering, mimicking its exposed rocky habitats. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant due to its succulent nature and native dry, rocky slopes. Overwatering will lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Sedum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, members of which are commonly known as stonecrops. The genus has been described as containing up to 600 species, subsequently reduced to 400–500. They are leaf succulents found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, but extending into the southern hemisphere in Africa and South America. The plants vary from annual and creeping herbs to shrubs. The plants have water-storing leaves. The flowers usually have five petals, seldom four or six. There are typically twice as many stamens as petals. Various species formerly classified as Sedum are now in the segregate genera Hylotelephium and Rhodiola.
Well-known European species of Sedum are Sedum acre, Sedum album, Sedum dasyphyllum, and Sedum hispanicum.

## Care Guide
This rock-dwelling succulent thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soils, mimicking its native montane to subalpine rocky habitats. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions, as it is highly drought tolerant and susceptible to root rot from overwatering. Minimal fertilization is required for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. A light, balanced fertilizer once in early spring is sufficient, or none at all if planted in rich enough soil.
