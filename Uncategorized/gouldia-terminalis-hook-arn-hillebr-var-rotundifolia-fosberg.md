# Gouldia Terminalis (Hook. & Arn.) Hillebr. Var. Rotundifolia Fosberg
### *Gouldia terminalis (Hook. & Arn.) Hillebr. var. rotundifolia Fosberg*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Maui, Hawaii) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest / Mesic Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect to partial sun. As an understory plant in its native habitat, it prefers filtered light and protection from direct, harsh sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil. Its native climate experiences frequent rainfall, so the soil should not be allowed to dry out completely between waterings, but also avoid waterlogging. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian native thrives in conditions similar to its tropical wet forest home, requiring consistently moist, well-draining soil and indirect to partial sunlight. Maintain high humidity and provide a balanced, diluted fertilizer during active growth to ensure optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to low. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied during the growing season to support its growth, mimicking the nutrient cycling in forest environments.
