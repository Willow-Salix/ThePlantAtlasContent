## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate to boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe and North America. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate to Boreal Wetland (specifically calciferous fens, springs, and base-rich mires). |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light to partial shade; direct sun should be avoided. Prefers dim, indirect light, similar to being submerged or growing under other vegetation. |
| **Watering** | Constantly moist to fully submerged. This moss requires perpetually wet conditions and high humidity, thriving in standing or slow-moving water. |

## Care Guide
Scorpidium Cossonii thrives in consistently wet, cool, and low-light environments, often submerged in calcareous water. Ensure continuous moisture and avoid direct sunlight to replicate its native fen and spring habitats. Fertilization is generally not required.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses have very low nutrient demands, and this species is adapted to nutrient-poor but mineral-rich (calcareous) environments.
