## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar-alpine regions, including Arctic zones (e.g., Greenland, Svalbard, Arctic Canada, Russia) and high mountain ranges globally (e.g., European Alps, Rocky Mountains, Himalayas, Andes, New Zealand). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Arctic Tundra. |
| **Sunlight** | Requires very high light exposure, mimicking its natural habitat on exposed rocks in high-altitude or arctic environments. Tolerates and thrives in full sun, often with intense UV, but benefits from cool temperatures and good air circulation. |
| **Watering** | As a lichen, it absorbs moisture directly from the atmosphere. It needs consistent access to high atmospheric humidity, regular misting, or exposure to dew/rain cycles, but with excellent air circulation to prevent fungal issues. Tolerant of periodic desiccation but requires rehydration to thrive. Avoid standing water or prolonged wetness without airflow. |

## Introduction
Pseudephebe is a genus of fruticose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. It contains three species that grow on rocks.

## Care Guide
This alpine-arctic lichen thrives in very bright, cool conditions with high atmospheric humidity and excellent air circulation, mimicking its natural rock habitat. It requires no traditional watering or fertilization, instead absorbing moisture and trace nutrients directly from the environment. Maintaining cold, exposed, yet atmospherically moist conditions is crucial for its care.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and their substrate and are highly sensitive to pollutants and excess nutrients, which can be detrimental to their growth.
