## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Europe, Northern Asia |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland, Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full sun; prefers partial shade in hotter climates to prevent leaf scorch and maintain variegation, mimicking its understory or edge-of-woodland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture, especially during dry periods, reflecting moderate rainfall in temperate zones. Tolerates some drought once established, but performs best with regular watering when the top inch of soil feels dry. |

## Introduction
Aegopodium is a plant genus of the family Apiaceae native to Europe and western Asia. It is represented by about twelve species, all are herbs. Flowers are compounded, umbels appearing in spring-summer and are visited by many types of insect pollinators. Fruit consists of two-winged or ribbed nuts that separate on ripening.
The most well-known member is the Aegopodium podagraria, the ground elder also known as snow-on-the-mountain, Bishop's weed, goutweed, native to Europe and Asia. It is variegated green and white that sometimes reverts to solid green within a patch. Small, white, five-petal flowers are held about three feet high, above the leaves, in flat topped clusters. Underground are long white branching rhizomes that vaguely resemble quackgrass. Regarded as an ecological threat, goutweed is aggressive, invasive and forms dense patches reducing species diversity in the ground layer. On the other hand, because of this, it is often used as a low maintenance ground cover.

## Care Guide
Variegated Goutweed is a highly adaptable plant, thriving in a range of light from partial shade to full sun, though some shade is beneficial in warm climates. It prefers consistently moist soil but tolerates drought once established. Minimal fertilization is required due to its vigorous nature and ability to grow in average soils, making it a low-maintenance groundcover.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Its native habitats often include average to rich woodland soils, but it's known to thrive even in poorer conditions, indicating it is not a heavy feeder. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth is desired, but often unnecessary.
