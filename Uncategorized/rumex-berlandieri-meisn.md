## 🌱 Overview
The docks and sorrels, genus Rumex, are a genus of about 200 species of annual, biennial, and perennial herbs in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae.
Members of this genus are very common perennial herbs with a native almost worldwide distribution, and introduced species growing in the few places where the genus is not native.
Some are nuisance weeds (and are sometimes called dockweed or dock weed), but some are grown for their edible leaves. Rumex species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species, and are the only host plants of Lycaena dispar and Lycaena rubidus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Berlandier's Dock thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native habitat in temperate to subtropical wetlands and riparian zones. Ensure the soil remains damp and provide moderate fertilization during its active growth to support its robust nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied during the growing season to support its robust growth, especially if native soils are not naturally rich in organic matter.
