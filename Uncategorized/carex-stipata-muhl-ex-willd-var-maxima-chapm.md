## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Stalkgrain Sedge is a wetland plant that demands consistently wet to saturated soil, thriving even in standing water. It is adaptable to a range of light conditions from full sun to partial shade, and due to its native habitat, it requires only light to moderate fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. An annual application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer or organic compost in spring should suffice, as wetland plants often derive nutrients from decaying organic matter.
