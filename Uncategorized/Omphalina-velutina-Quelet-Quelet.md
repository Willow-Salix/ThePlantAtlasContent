## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Europe and North America (cool temperate to boreal regions) |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light to indirect light, mimicking the conditions of a dense forest floor or shaded, mossy areas. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist substrate and high humidity are essential, reflecting its habitat among mosses and decaying wood in damp forests; avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Omphalina is a genus of small agarics with white, nonamyloid, basidiospores and decurrent gills. Typically the cap has a deep central depression giving the umbrella-like to funnel-shaped cap the appearance of a belly button, or a belly with a navel. Similarly-shaped agarics are said to be omphalinoid in appearance.

## Care Guide
This fungus thrives in cool, damp environments with very low light, typical of a forest floor. It requires a consistently moist substrate rich in decaying organic material rather than traditional fertilization, making its cultivation focused on providing the right decomposing medium.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable in the traditional sense; this fungus derives nutrients from decomposing organic matter (e.g., very rotten wood, peat, moss) and requires a substrate rich in such materials.
