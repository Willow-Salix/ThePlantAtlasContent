## Care Guide
The Kodiak Keyflower thrives in the cool, moist conditions of its native subarctic bogs. It requires consistently wet, acidic, and nutrient-poor soil, along with bright indirect to moderate sunlight. Mimic its natural habitat by providing ample moisture and minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient requirements. If fertilizing, use a highly diluted, balanced orchid fertilizer very sparingly during the active growth period, reflecting its natural preference for nutrient-poor, acidic bog soils.
