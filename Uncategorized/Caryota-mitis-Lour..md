## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade; protect from intense direct afternoon sun, which can scorch leaves, as it often grows in the understory or forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, allowing the top inch or two to dry out slightly between waterings, mimicking consistent rainforest humidity and rainfall. Requires high humidity. |

## Introduction
Caryota is a genus of palm trees. They are often known as fishtail palms because of the shape of their leaves.
As of September 2025, the genus comprises 14 accepted species, with a native distribution ranging from the Indian subcontinent and southern China, extending in a south-east direction to Queensland, Australia and Vanuatu.
One of the more widely known species is Caryota urens, the flowers of which are used to make one type of jaggery (an unrefined sugar), and also to make palm wine. Caryota mitis is native to Indochina, but has become an invasive introduced species in the US state of Florida. They are also one of the few Arecaceae with bipinnate foliage. Many grow in mountainous areas and are adapted to warm mediterranean climates as well as subtropical and tropical climates.
Fishtail palms contain raphides.

## Care Guide
To thrive, this palm requires conditions similar to its native tropical rainforest, meaning bright indirect light or partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. High humidity is crucial, and it benefits from regular feeding during warmer months. Protect it from direct, harsh sunlight.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release palm fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer) to support its vigorous growth in nutrient-rich but potentially leached rainforest soils.
