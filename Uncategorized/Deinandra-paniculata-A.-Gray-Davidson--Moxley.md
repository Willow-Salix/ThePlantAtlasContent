## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean scrubland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, particularly during dry periods. Avoid over-fertilization, as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and does not tolerate rich, heavily fertilized conditions well.
