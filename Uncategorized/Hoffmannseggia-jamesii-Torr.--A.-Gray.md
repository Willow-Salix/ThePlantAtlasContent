## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland and Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive in conditions similar to its native open habitats. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent but deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, mimicking its adaptation to erratic rainfall. |

## Introduction
Hoffmannseggia is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, known generally as rushpeas. These are pod-bearing herbs and subshrubs native to the Americas. In North America they range from California and Nebraska to southern Mexico, and from Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru to southern Argentina and Chile in South America.
The generic name honors Johann Centurius, Count of Hoffmannsegg, a nineteenth-century German nobleman and botanist.

## Care Guide
James' Rushpea thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, typical of its arid native environment. Water sparingly, ensuring the soil dries completely between waterings, and requires very little to no supplemental fertilizer. This resilient plant is well-suited for xeriscaping or low-maintenance gardens in hot, dry climates.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native to lean, often sandy or rocky soils, it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. If fertilized, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient.
