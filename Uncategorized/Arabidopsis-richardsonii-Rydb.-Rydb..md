## Introduction
Arabidopsis (rockcress) is a genus of small flowering plants in the cabbage and mustard family, Brassicaceae. Arabidopsis species are native to temperate and subarctic Eurasia and North America, North Africa, and the mountains of eastern tropical Africa. This genus is of great interest since it contains thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), one of the model organisms used for studying plant biology and the first plant to have its entire genome sequenced. Changes in thale cress are easily observed, making it a very useful model.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in environments mimicking its native alpine conditions, preferring cool temperatures and bright light. Ensure well-drained soil that remains consistently moist, and fertilize sparingly to reflect its natural lean habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of a balanced, diluted fertilizer during the active growing season is sufficient.
