## 🧤 Care Instructions
Michaux's Milkvetch thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions characteristic of its native dry pine flatwoods and sandhills. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, preferring lean, sandy soils with little to no supplemental fertilizer. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is needed. It thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils and, as a legume, fixes its own nitrogen.
