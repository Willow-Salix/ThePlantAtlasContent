## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern United States |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest (Riparian Zones) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to dappled sunlight, mimicking understory conditions found along woodland edges or stream banks. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist; frequent watering is essential, especially during dry periods, to prevent the soil from drying out, similar to its native floodplains and river bottoms. |

## Introduction
Iodanthus pinnatifidus, commonly known as purplerocket, is a species of flowering plant in the mustard family. It is monotypic, with no other species in the genus Iodanthus.
It is native to eastern North America, where its range is centered in the Midwest and Upper South regions of the United States. Its typical natural habitat is in wet to mesic forests, in bottomlands and lower slopes. It can also occur in more open wet thickets and meadows. It is a conservative species that typically occurs in intact natural areas, and is not found in ecologically degraded sites.
Iodanthus pinnatifidus is an erect perennial herb. It produces a raceme of light purple flowers which fade to white. It blooms from late April to early July.

## Care Guide
Iodanthus thrives in consistently moist soil and partial shade, mirroring its native riparian woodland habitat. Ensure regular watering and provide a rich, organic growing medium for optimal health, reflecting its preference for fertile, damp environments.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, organic soil; moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release product or annual compost amendment will support its growth in nutrient-rich riparian soils.
