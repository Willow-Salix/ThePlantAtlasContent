## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Montane Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its native open, exposed habitat. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent watering. Mimic its native drought conditions by allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering is detrimental. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
James' Buckwheat thrives in bright, dry conditions, mirroring its native Southwestern US habitat. It requires full sun exposure and very infrequent watering, along with well-draining, lean soil to prevent root rot and ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Its native rocky, lean soils suggest it thrives in low-nutrient conditions. If desired, a very diluted, low-phosphorus fertilizer can be applied sparingly once in spring.
