## Care Guide
Green Deathcamas thrives in temperate, montane regions of Western North America, preferring full sun to partial shade and moist, well-drained soils during its spring growth. Provide moderate watering and low to moderate fertilization to mimic its native grassland and open woodland environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, but generally not a heavy feeder.
