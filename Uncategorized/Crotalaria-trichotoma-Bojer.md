## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Madagascar, Tropical East Africa |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Savanna |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and flowering, though it can tolerate partial sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Water moderately during the growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry out completely between waterings. Its native climate suggests tolerance to distinct wet and dry periods, making it somewhat drought-tolerant once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Crotalaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae (subfamily Faboideae) commonly known as rattlepods. The genus includes over 700 species of herbaceous plants and shrubs. Africa is the continent with the majority of Crotalaria species (approximately 400 species), which are mainly found in damp grassland, especially in floodplains, depressions and along edges of swamps and rivers, but also in deciduous bush land, roadsides and fields. Some species of Crotalaria are grown as ornamentals. The common name rattlepod or rattlebox is derived from the fact that the seeds become loose in the pod as they mature, and rattle when the pod is shaken. The name derives from the Ancient Greek κρόταλον, meaning "castanet", and is the same root as the name for the rattlesnakes (Crotalus).
Crotalaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Endoclita sericeus, Etiella zinckenella and Utetheisa ornatrix. The toxic alkaloids produced by some members of this genus are known to be incorporated by Utetheisia larvae and used to secure their defense from predators.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical savanna native thrives in full sun with moderate watering, adapting well to periods of dryness. It benefits from light, balanced fertilization during its active growth, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. As a legume, it can fix nitrogen, so a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied monthly during the active growing season is sufficient, or less if planted in naturally fertile soil.
