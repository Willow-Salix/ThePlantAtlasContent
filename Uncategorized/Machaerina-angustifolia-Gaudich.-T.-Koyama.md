Machaerina (twigrush) is a genus of flowering plants in the sedge family. Its species occur in tropical America, the West Indies, Malesia, Australia and the Pacific region. The name comes from the Greek machaira (a large knife), alluding to the shape of the leaves in the type species – Machaerina restioides.
