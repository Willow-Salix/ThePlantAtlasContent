## Care Guide
Diplopterygium thrives in consistently moist, humid conditions with partial to bright indirect light, mimicking its native tropical and subtropical forest environments. Ensure well-draining soil and provide occasional, diluted fertilization during active growth to support its robust, spreading habit.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Apply a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer); reduce or cease in winter.
