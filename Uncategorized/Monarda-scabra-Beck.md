## Introduction
Monarda fistulosa, the wild bergamot or bee balm, is a wildflower in the mint family Lamiaceae, widespread and abundant as a native plant in much of North America. This plant, with showy summer-blooming pink to lavender flowers, is often used as a honey plant, medicinal plant, and garden ornamental.  The species is quite variable, and several subspecies or varieties have been recognized within it. Despite its name, it has no relation to the 'true' bergamot, a citrus fruit.

## Care Guide
Wild Bergamot is a resilient plant best suited for full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native prairie and woodland edge environments. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal fertilization, thriving in leaner soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in average to poor soils, typical of its native habitat. Avoid excessive fertilization, which can lead to leggy growth.
