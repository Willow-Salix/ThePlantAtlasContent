## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Europe (Fennoscandia, Iceland), Greenland, Northern Russia (Siberia), thriving in subalpine and subarctic regions. |
| **Climate** | Boreal/Subarctic, Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun for optimal growth and vigor, tolerating partial sun conditions, especially in the warmest parts of its range. |
| **Watering** | Needs consistently moist, but well-drained soil, reflecting its native environment with ample snowmelt and rainfall. Avoid both drought stress and waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Betula pubescens (syn. Betula alba), commonly known as downy birch and also as moor birch, white birch, European white birch or hairy birch, is a species of deciduous tree, native and abundant throughout northern Europe and northern Asia, growing further north than any other broadleaf tree. It is closely related to, and often confused with, the silver birch (B. pendula), but grows in wetter places with heavier soils and poorer drainage; smaller trees can also be confused with the dwarf birch (B. nana).
Six varieties are recognised and it hybridises with the silver and dwarf birches. A number of cultivars have been developed, but many are no longer in cultivation. The larva of the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) feeds on the foliage and in some years, large areas of birch forest can be defoliated by this insect. Many fungi are associated with the tree and certain pathogenic fungi are the causal agents of birch dieback disease.
The tree is a pioneer species, readily colonising cleared land, but later being replaced by taller, more long-lived species. The bark can be stripped off without killing the tree. The bark and the timber is used for turnery and in the manufacture of plywood, furniture, shelves, coffins, matches, toys and wood flooring. The inner bark is edible and it was ground up and used in bread-making in times of famine. The rising sap in spring can be used to make refreshing drinks, wines, ales and liqueurs and various parts of the tree have been used in herbal medicine.

## Care Guide
The Downy Birch thrives in cool, northern climates, requiring full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It has low to moderate fertilizer needs, reflecting its adaptation to less nutrient-rich environments. Ensure good air circulation and protection from excessive heat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It is adapted to relatively infertile soils; light annual fertilization with a balanced, slow-release product or enriching the soil with organic matter is usually sufficient.
