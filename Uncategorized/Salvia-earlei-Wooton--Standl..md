## Introduction
Salvia () is the largest genus of plants in the sage family Lamiaceae, with just under 1,000 species of shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and annuals. Within the Lamiaceae, Salvia is part of the tribe Mentheae within the subfamily Nepetoideae.  One of several genera commonly referred to as sage, it includes two widely used herbs, Salvia officinalis (common sage, or just "sage") and Salvia rosmarinus (rosemary, formerly Rosmarinus officinalis). 
The genus is distributed throughout the Old World and the Americas (over 900 total species), with three distinct regions of diversity: Central America and South America (approximately 600 species); Central Asia and the Mediterranean (250 species); Eastern Asia (90 species).

## Care Guide
Earley's Sage thrives in full sun and dry conditions, reflecting its native arid scrubland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, preferring lean soils. Over-watering and rich fertilization should be avoided.

### Fertilizer
Low. Generally thrives in lean to poor soils and does not require frequent fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring may be beneficial in very poor soils.
