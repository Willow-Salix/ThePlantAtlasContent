## Introduction
Eucalyptus botryoides, commonly known as the bangalay, bastard jarrah, woollybutt or southern mahogany, is a small to tall tree native to southeastern Australia. Reaching up to 40 metres (130 feet) high, it has rough bark on its trunk and branches. It is found on sandstone- or shale-based soils in open woodland, or on more sandy soils behind sand dunes. The white flowers appear in summer and autumn. It reproduces by resprouting from its woody lignotuber or epicormic buds after bushfire. E. botryoides hybridises with the Sydney blue gum (E. saligna) in the Sydney region. The hard, durable wood has been used for panelling and flooring.

## Care Guide
Thriving in its native coastal forest environment, Southern Mahogany requires full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Water regularly, particularly during establishment, and use a low-phosphorus fertilizer sparingly to support its growth without over-enrichment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, typically with a low-phosphorus formula suitable for Australian native plants, especially in poor soils. Avoid over-fertilization.
