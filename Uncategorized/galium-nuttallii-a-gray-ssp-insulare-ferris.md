## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California Channel Islands, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (Chaparral and Coastal Sage Scrub) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in bright, open conditions typical of its native scrubland habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during the dry summer months. Requires more water during cooler, wet growing seasons. |

## 🌱 Overview
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This climbing bedstraw, native to the California Channel Islands, thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly drought-tolerant once established. Provide infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely, and minimal fertilization to mimic its natural Mediterranean scrubland environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Does not require rich soil; an annual application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season is sufficient, or none at all for established outdoor plants.
