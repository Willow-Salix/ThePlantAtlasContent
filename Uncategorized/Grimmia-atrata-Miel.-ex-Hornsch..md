## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including Europe (Alps, Scandinavia), North America (Rocky Mountains, higher latitudes), and parts of Asia, typically in montane and alpine areas. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate some direct morning sun in cooler climates but generally prefers protection from intense afternoon sun, especially in warmer conditions. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage. Allow the surface to dry slightly between waterings but do not let it dry out completely for extended periods. Replicate meltwater conditions. |

## Introduction
Grimmia is a genus of mosses, originally named by Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart in honour of Johann Friedrich Carl Grimm, a physician and botanist from Gotha, Germany.

## Care Guide
Grimmia Dry Rock Moss thrives in cool, high-altitude conditions with bright, indirect light and consistent moisture, mimicking its native alpine environment. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging, and avoid heavy fertilization as it prefers nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Mosses are not heavy feeders, and alpine environments are typically nutrient-poor. High fertilizer concentrations can be detrimental.
