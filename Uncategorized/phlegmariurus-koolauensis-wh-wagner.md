## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rare Hawaiian clubmoss thrives in conditions mimicking its native cloud forest environment, requiring very high humidity and consistent moisture. Provide indirect bright light and ensure the growing medium offers excellent drainage. Fertilize very sparingly during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a highly diluted liquid fertilizer during the active growing season. As an epiphyte, it derives nutrients from decaying organic matter.
