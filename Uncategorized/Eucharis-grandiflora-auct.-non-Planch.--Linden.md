## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Upper Amazon basin, specifically Peru and Colombia |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect light, mimicking its native understory environment. Direct sunlight should be avoided as it can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture during its active growth period, typical of a rainforest floor. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce frequency significantly during dormancy in winter. |

## Introduction
Urceolina is a genus of South American plants in the amaryllis family native to Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Panama, and Peru. It has also been introduced to many South and Central American states, as well as India and Sri Lanka. The formerly accepted genera Eucharis and Caliphruria are now regarded as synonyms of this genus. Many species of this genus share the common name Amazon lily.

## Care Guide
To thrive, the Amazon Lily needs bright, indirect light and consistently moist but well-draining soil, along with high humidity. Feed regularly during the spring and summer, and provide a cooler, drier rest period in winter to encourage blooming.

### Fertilizer
Beneficial to fertilize every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring through summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, reflecting the nutrient cycling in its native habitat. Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
