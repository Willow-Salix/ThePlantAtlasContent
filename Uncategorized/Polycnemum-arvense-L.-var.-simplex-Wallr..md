## Care Guide
This hardy annual thrives in full sun and well-draining, even poor soils, mirroring its natural habitat in open, disturbed ground. Water moderately, allowing the soil to completely dry out between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization as it is highly drought-tolerant and not a heavy feeder.

### Fertilizer
Low to None. This plant thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils and does not require rich nutrients. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
