## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (primarily California, USA) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Grasslands, Chaparral) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it thrives in open, exposed areas typical of its native grasslands and chaparral. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate watering; tolerant of drought once established, preferring drier conditions during summer consistent with its Mediterranean native climate. |

## Introduction
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## Care Guide
Dwarf Checkerbloom thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean climate. It requires low to moderate watering, especially after establishment, tolerating dry periods well. Minimal fertilization is needed to maintain its health and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilizer; it is adapted to moderately fertile soils common in its natural habitat and generally does not require heavy feeding.
