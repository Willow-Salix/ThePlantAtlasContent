## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, East Asia, parts of Africa, and Australia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas, and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in open, exposed areas, grasslands, and disturbed sites. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist soil, mimicking the ample rainfall of its native tropical climate, but is highly drought-tolerant once established due to its aggressive root system. |

## Introduction
Imperata cylindrica (commonly known as cogongrass  or kunai grass ) is a species of perennial rhizomatous grass native to tropical and subtropical Asia, Micronesia, Melanesia, Australia, Africa, and Southern Europe. It has also been introduced to Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Southeastern United States. It is a highly flammable pyrophyte, and can spread rapidly by colonizing disturbed areas and encouraging more frequent wildfires.

## Care Guide
Cogon Grass thrives in full sun with consistently moist soil, reflecting its native grassland environment. It is highly adaptable and can tolerate drought and poor soils, making it a robust but potentially invasive plant. Minimal fertilization is needed for its care.

### Fertilizer
Low, as this plant is very adaptable and can thrive even in nutrient-poor and disturbed soils. Excessive fertilization is generally unnecessary.
