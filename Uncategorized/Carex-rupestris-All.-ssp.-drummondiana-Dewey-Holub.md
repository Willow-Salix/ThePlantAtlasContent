## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and alpine regions of North America, including Alaska, Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and the Rocky Mountains (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Alberta, British Columbia). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure; thrives in full sun, reflecting its native environment above the treeline or in open arctic landscapes. It requires direct, unfiltered sunlight for optimal growth. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist but extremely well-drained soil, especially during its short growing season, mimicking conditions from melting snow and seasonal precipitation. Avoid waterlogging, particularly in cold conditions. |

## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This alpine/arctic sedge demands full sun and consistently moist, yet highly well-drained soil to replicate its native tundra habitat. It thrives in nutrient-poor conditions, requiring minimal to no fertilization. Protection from prolonged heat and humidity is essential, favoring cool, open environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, lean soils typical of alpine and arctic environments. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
