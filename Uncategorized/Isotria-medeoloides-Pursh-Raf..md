## Care Guide
This rare terrestrial orchid requires a cool, moist, and shaded understory environment typical of temperate deciduous forests. Ensure consistently moist, well-drained acidic soil rich in organic matter, and provide very minimal fertilization to mimic its natural reliance on decaying leaf litter for nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Very low to minimal; nutrient needs are primarily met by decaying organic matter (leaf litter) in its natural habitat. If fertilized, use a very dilute, balanced solution sparingly once per growing season.
