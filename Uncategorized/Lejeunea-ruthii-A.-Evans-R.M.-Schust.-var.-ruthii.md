## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in consistently humid, moist environments with low, filtered light, mimicking its native habitat on shaded rocks and tree bases near streams. Ensure constant moisture and high ambient humidity, avoiding direct sun and excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low; minimal to no fertilization is needed. If used, apply a highly diluted liquid bryophyte-specific fertilizer sparingly.
