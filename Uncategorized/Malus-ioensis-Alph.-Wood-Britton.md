## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central United States (ranging from Minnesota south to Louisiana, and east to Ohio and Kentucky) |
| **Climate** | Temperate, characterized by hot summers and cold winters, found in open woodlands, prairies, and along stream banks. |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight) for optimal flowering and fruiting. Can tolerate light partial shade, especially in the hottest parts of its range. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering, particularly during dry spells, to mimic the seasonal rainfall of its native habitat. Established plants show some drought tolerance but prefer consistently moist, well-drained soil. |
