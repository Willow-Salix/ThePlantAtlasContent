## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (Intermountain West), including Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring direct sunlight for most of the day to thrive, mimicking its open desert and scrubland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering will lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## Care Guide
This arid-adapted plant thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soils. It requires infrequent, deep watering, as it is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to overwatering. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its native low-nutrient environment.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is required, as it is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor sandy or gravelly soils found in its native habitat.
