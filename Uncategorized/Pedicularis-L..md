## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America (especially western mountains), Europe, and Asia (especially the Himalayas and mountainous China). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine Meadows, with some species found in Arctic Tundra or temperate bogs. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun exposure; requires bright light for optimal growth. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil; never allow the soil to dry out completely, mimicking the constant moisture from snowmelt and rainfall in their native habitats. |

## Care Guide
Louseworts thrive in cool, consistently moist environments with bright light, reflecting their alpine and subalpine origins. Ensure the soil remains perpetually damp and avoid over-fertilization due to their hemi-parasitic nature.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As hemi-parasitic plants, they derive a significant portion of their nutrients from host plants; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
