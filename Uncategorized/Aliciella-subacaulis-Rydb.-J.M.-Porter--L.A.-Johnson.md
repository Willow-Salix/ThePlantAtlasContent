## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, indicative of its drought-tolerant nature in arid regions. |

## Introduction
Aliciella is a genus of plants in the phlox family. It includes 23 species native to the western United States and northwestern Mexico. These plants have been treated as members of genus Gilia until recently, when it was proposed they be moved back to Aliciella. This genus was created in 1905 to include certain gilias that seemed distinct from most of the others, but it was abandoned soon after. Later genetic analyses suggest it should be revived.

## Care Guide
Pinyon Gilia thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soil, requiring very little water once established. Mimicking its high desert origin, it is highly drought-tolerant and benefits from minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant for arid landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; native soils are typically lean, suggesting minimal supplemental fertilization is needed, perhaps a light application once a year.
