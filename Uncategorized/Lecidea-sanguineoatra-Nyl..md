## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Europe, particularly Northern and Central Europe, often in upland and montane regions (e.g., Scandinavia, British Isles, Alps). |
| **Climate** | Upland Temperate / Montane, characterized by cool temperatures, high atmospheric humidity, and frequent precipitation (rain, fog). |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. While found on exposed rocks, it benefits from some shelter from the most intense direct sunlight, especially during peak warmth. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and frequent exposure to moisture (rain, mist, fog) to thrive. It should never be allowed to dry out completely for extended periods, as it absorbs water directly from the environment. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, humid conditions found in upland European environments. It requires bright, indirect light and consistently high atmospheric moisture from mist or humidity. Avoid traditional fertilizers as they are unnecessary and potentially harmful.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens are self-sufficient composite organisms that derive necessary nutrients from the air, rainwater, and substrates, and do not require traditional fertilization.
