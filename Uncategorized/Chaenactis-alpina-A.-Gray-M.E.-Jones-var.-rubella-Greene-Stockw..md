## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically high elevations in the Sierra Nevada and White Mountains of California and Nevada, USA) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6+ hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, mimicking its exposed mountain habitat. |
| **Watering** | Requires well-drained soil and moderate watering. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings, especially after the initial spring growth, as it's adapted to rocky, often droughty alpine soils after snowmelt. |

## Introduction
Chaenactis is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae which are known generally as pincushions and dustymaidens.
These wildflowers are native to western North America, especially the desert southwest of the United States. They are quite variable in appearance. They are generally aster-like in appearance with many disc florets in each head. There may be only disc florets, but sometimes there are also enlarged ray florets along the edges of the corolla. They may be white to yellow or pink.

## Care Guide
Provide full sun and excellent drainage, replicating its high-mountain origins. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization to prevent lush, weak growth. This plant thrives on lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; these plants are adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky alpine soils. A very light, balanced fertilizer might be applied once in spring if growth is poor, but generally not necessary.
