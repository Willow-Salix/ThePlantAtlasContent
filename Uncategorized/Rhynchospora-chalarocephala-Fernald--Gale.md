## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily coastal plain states from Virginia to Texas) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Wet Pine Flatwoods, Savannas, Bogs) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers open, exposed areas typical of its native wetland habitats. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its natural habitat in bogs, wet flatwoods, and ditches. It should never be allowed to dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## Care Guide
Loosehead Beaksedge thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet soil, replicating its native bog and wet flatwood environments. It is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, so fertilizer needs are minimal. Ensure it never dries out to mimic its natural wetland habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a native wetland plant adapted to nutrient-poor sandy or boggy soils, excessive fertilizer can be detrimental. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
