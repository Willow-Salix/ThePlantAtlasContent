## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East African Highlands (e.g., Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda) |
| **Climate** | Afro-montane Grassland and Moorland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright, direct light for optimal growth and flowering, typical of open high-altitude environments. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering during the active growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry out completely between waterings. Tolerates short periods of drought once established, reflecting its native seasonal rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
The genus Helichrysum  consists of an estimated 600 species of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). The type species is Helichrysum orientale. They often go by the names everlasting, immortelle, and strawflower. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words ἥλιος (helios, sun) and χρῡσός (chrysos, gold).
It occurs in Africa (with 244 species in South Africa), Madagascar, Australasia and Eurasia. The plants may be annuals, herbaceous perennials or shrubs, growing to a height of 60–90 cm (24–35 inches). The genus was a wastebasket taxon, and many of its members have been reclassified in smaller genera, most notably the Everlastings, now in the genus Xerochrysum.
Their leaves are oblong to lanceolate. They are flat and pubescent on both sides. The bristles of the pappus are scabrous, barbellate, or plumose.
The receptacle (base of the flower head) is often smooth, with a fringed margin, or honey-combed, and resemble daisies. They may be in almost all colors, except blue. There are many capitula and generally flat-topped corymbs or panicles. The corolla lobes show glandular hairs at the abaxial surface.
Helichrysum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the bucculaticid leaf-miners Bucculatrix gnaphaliella (which feeds exclusively on Helichrysum arenarium) and Bucculatrix helichrysella (feeds exclusively on H. italicum) and the Coleophora case-bearers C. caelebipennella, C. gnaphalii (feeds exclusively on H arenarium) and C. helichrysiella (feeds exclusively on H. italicum).

## Care Guide
This East African montane plant thrives in bright, direct sunlight and well-drained soil, mimicking its open, high-altitude origins. Water regularly during its active growth, letting the soil dry out between waterings, and provide minimal fertilization to align with its leaner native soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula once or twice during the active growing season is sufficient. Over-fertilizing should be avoided as native montane soils are typically not overly rich.
