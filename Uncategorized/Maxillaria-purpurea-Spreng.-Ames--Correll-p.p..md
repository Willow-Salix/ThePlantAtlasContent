## Introduction
Maxillaria, abbreviated as Max in the horticultural trade, is a large genus of orchids (family Orchidaceae). This is a diverse genus, with very different morphological forms. Their characteristics can vary widely.
They are commonly called spider orchids, flame orchids or tiger orchids. Their scientific name is derived from the Latin word maxilla, meaning jawbone, reflecting on the column and the base of the lip of some species, that may evoke a protruding jaw.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical moist forests, preferring bright indirect light and high humidity. Consistent watering is essential, allowing the roots to dry out briefly between applications, supported by light, regular fertilization during its growing season.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced orchid fertilizer, applied at a diluted strength (e.g., quarter strength) every 1-2 weeks during active growth.
