| **Climate** | Subtropical Grassland / Pine Flatwoods |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and flowering) |
| **Watering** | Moderate, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established due to its native habitat's occasional dry periods. |

## Care Guide
This bluestem variety, native to the open, sunny grasslands and pine flatwoods of the Southeastern U.S., thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering, tolerating periods of drought once established, and has low fertilizer needs, thriving in average to poor soils without much intervention.

### Fertilizer
Low, as it naturally thrives in nutrient-poor to average soils. Fertilizer is generally not needed, or a light application of a balanced, slow-release formula can be used in extremely depleted soils.
