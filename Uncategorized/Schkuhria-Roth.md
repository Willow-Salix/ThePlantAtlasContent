## Introduction
Schkuhria is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Bahieae within the family Asteraceae. False threadleaf is a common name. It includes two species native to the Americas, ranging from the south-central United States to Argentina. The genus was named in honour of Christian Schkuhr (1741-1811), a German gardener and physical scientist at the University of Wittenberg.

## Care Guide
False Threadleaf thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, showing strong drought tolerance. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. Minimal fertilization is required, mimicking its native semi-arid and montane environments.

### Fertilizer
Low; a light application of balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, especially in poor soils.
