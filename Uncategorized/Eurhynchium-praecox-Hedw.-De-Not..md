## Care Guide
This moss thrives in a cool, humid environment with consistent moisture and low light, replicating its native temperate forest floor habitat. Avoid direct sun and ensure the substrate remains damp but not waterlogged, while high humidity is crucial for its health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Mosses have low nutrient demands and can typically derive what they need from their environment.
