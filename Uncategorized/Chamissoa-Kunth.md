## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |

| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forest, often found in forest edges, clearings, and secondary vegetation. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Can tolerate some morning sun but should be protected from intense, direct afternoon sun, especially in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained, avoiding waterlogging. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch, mimicking the frequent rainfall of its native habitat. |

## Care Guide
Chamissoa thrives in conditions similar to its native tropical forest edges, requiring bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Moderate fertilization during active growth will support its vigorous habit. Ensure good air circulation and avoid extreme temperature fluctuations.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, typically every 2-4 weeks. Reduce or cease fertilization during the cooler, darker months.
