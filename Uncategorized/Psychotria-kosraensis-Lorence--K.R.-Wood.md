## Introduction
Psychotria is a large genus of flowering plants in the coffee family Rubiaceae, with over 1,600 species. The genus has a pantropical distribution and members of the genus are small understorey trees in tropical forests. Some species are endangered or facing extinction due to deforestation, especially species of central Africa and the Pacific.
Many species, including Psychotria viridis, produce the psychedelic chemical dimethyltryptamine (DMT).

## Care Guide
This tropical plant requires a consistently moist environment with high humidity, typical of its native rainforest habitat. Provide low to medium indirect light and avoid direct sunlight to prevent leaf scorch. Fertilize moderately during active growth to support its lush foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization; use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength monthly during the growing season (spring and summer).
