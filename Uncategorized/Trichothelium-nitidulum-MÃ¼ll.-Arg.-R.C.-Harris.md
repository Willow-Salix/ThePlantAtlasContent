## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest environment, requiring high humidity and low to moderate indirect light. Ensure consistent moisture through misting and good air circulation, as no traditional fertilization is needed.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain nutrients from atmospheric deposition, rainwater, and their substrate.
