## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical Americas, including Southern Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean (e.g., Florida, West Indies), and northern South America (e.g., Brazil, Colombia). |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest / Subtropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light. As an understory or epiphytic plant, it thrives in dappled shade; direct sunlight will scorch its leaves. |
| **Watering** | Keep the substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water frequently, ensuring good drainage, and maintain high humidity, ideally through misting or a pebble tray. |

## Introduction
Pteris cretica, the Cretan brake, ribbon fern, or Cretan brake fern, is a species of evergreen fern in the family Pteridaceae, native to Europe, Asia and Africa.

## Care Guide
The Ribbon Fern requires conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest environment: high humidity, consistent moisture, and low to medium indirect light. Avoid direct sun and ensure good drainage to prevent root rot, while providing minimal, diluted fertilization during its active growth phase.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization; use a diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., half-strength) every 4-6 weeks during the growing season, or even less frequently, as epiphytes generally require minimal nutrients.
