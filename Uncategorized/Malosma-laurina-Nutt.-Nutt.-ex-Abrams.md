## Care Guide
Laurel sumac thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean climate. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization is generally not needed, as it prefers lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally not required. If growth is poor, a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial.
