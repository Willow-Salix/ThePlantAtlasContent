## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and Central North America, including eastern Canada (Ontario, Quebec) and the eastern/midwestern United States (e.g., New England, Great Lakes states, south to North Carolina, west to Missouri). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest / Humid Continental (specifically moist, shaded areas within this biome). |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial Shade to Full Shade. Thrives in the understory or along edges of moist woodlands, avoiding harsh direct sun. |
| **💧 Water** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil. Its natural habitat in wetlands, swamps, and streambanks means it does not tolerate drying out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Torrey's Sedge thrives in cool, consistently moist to wet conditions, preferring partial to full shade to mimic its native woodland and wetland habitats. Ensure its soil never dries out and enrich with organic matter for best growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; benefits from soil rich in organic matter. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost application in spring is sufficient if soil nutrients are poor.
