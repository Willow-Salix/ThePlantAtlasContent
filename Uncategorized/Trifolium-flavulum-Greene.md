## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub (Mediterranean climate) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in open, exposed areas typical of grasslands and chaparral. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during its active growth period (fall through spring, mirroring Mediterranean wet season). Tolerates dry conditions in summer as it typically completes its lifecycle. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This clover thrives in full sun to partial shade in a Mediterranean-like climate. Provide moderate water during its active growth from fall to spring, allowing it to naturally dry out or die back in summer. It requires minimal fertilizer, particularly avoiding high nitrogen, as it enhances soil fertility naturally.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer, especially avoiding high nitrogen due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Thrives in average to somewhat poor soils.
