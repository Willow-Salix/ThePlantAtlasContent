## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Alaska, British Columbia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool, Moist Coniferous and Boreal Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect light to partial shade; avoid direct, intense sunlight which can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires very high atmospheric humidity and regular moisture from mist or rain; it does not absorb water through roots. Ensure consistent dampness without prolonged submersion. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bryoria is a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. Many members of this genus are known as horsehair lichens. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in boreal and cool temperate areas. These lichens typically grow as slender, hair-like strands that hang from conifer trees or form small bushes, ranging in colour from dark brown to pale grey. They play important ecological roles, particularly as winter food for caribou in northern forests, where some species can accumulate in large quantities in the forest canopy. The genus contains about 35 species found worldwide, with ongoing discoveries of new species especially in mountainous regions of Asia and western North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for horsehair lichen, replicate its native cool, humid forest environment. Provide indirect or dappled light, maintain very high atmospheric humidity through frequent misting, and avoid direct sun. No fertilization is needed as it is sensitive to chemical inputs and draws nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens are sensitive and derive all necessary nutrients from the air and moisture.
