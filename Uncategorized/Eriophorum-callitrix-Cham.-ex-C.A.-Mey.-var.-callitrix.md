| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Boreal Wetlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (requires high light exposure, typical of open tundra environments with long summer daylight hours) |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to boggy conditions; thrives in saturated soil or shallow standing water, mimicking its natural habitat in bogs and marshes. |

## Introduction
Eriophorum callitrix, commonly known as Arctic cotton, Arctic cottongrass, suputi, or pualunnguat in Inuktitut, is a perennial Arctic plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is one of the most widespread flowering plants in the northern hemisphere and tundra regions. Upon every stem grows a single round, white and wooly fruit. The seeds are covered in this cottony mass and usually disperse when the wind carries them away.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun with consistently wet to boggy conditions, replicating its natural arctic tundra habitat. It requires very low fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; native soils in tundra environments are typically nutrient-poor, so minimal to no fertilization is required.
