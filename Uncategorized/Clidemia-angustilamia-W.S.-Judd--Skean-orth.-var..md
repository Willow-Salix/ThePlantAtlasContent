## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hispaniola (Dominican Republic, Haiti) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane/Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Requires dappled to indirect light, mimicking its native understory habitat. Avoid direct, harsh sunlight which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Needs consistently moist but not waterlogged soil, reflecting the high rainfall and humidity of its native cloud forest environment. Ensure excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Miconia is a genus of flowering plants in the glory bush family, Melastomataceae, native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Americas. The species are mostly shrubs and small to medium-sized trees up to 15 m tall. The generic name honours Catalan physician and botanist Francesc Micó. Some species are known by the common name johnnyberry.
Many species are threatened by habitat destruction in their native range, and some are feared to be on the brink of extinction. On the other hand, M. calvescens is a contributing factor in the decline and maybe even extinction of other plants: it has become a highly invasive weed on a number of Pacific Islands where it was introduced, including Hawaii and Tahiti. It is often referred to as the "purple plague" or the "green cancer" in reference to its habit of overgrowing native ecosystems, and its leaves which are bright green above and bright purple below.
Miconia fruit are a favorite food of many birds (invasive M. calvescens spreads by this route). The leaves of some species are eaten by caterpillars of the moth-butterflies (Hedylidae).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in high-humidity environments with consistent, indirect light, mimicking its native tropical montane forest. Maintain evenly moist, well-draining soil and provide moderate fertilization during active growth to support its health and development.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization during the growing season with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer. Native soils are typically moderate in nutrients from organic decomposition.
