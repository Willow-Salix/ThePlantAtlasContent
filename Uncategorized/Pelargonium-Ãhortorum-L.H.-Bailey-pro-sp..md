## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Africa, primarily the Cape region of South Africa (ancestral species) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical, often Mediterranean-like, characterized by open, well-drained habitats and varying rainfall patterns |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers bright, direct light for optimal flowering, reflecting its origin in open, exposed areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking periods of drought in its native environment. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Pelargonium × hortorum, commonly called zonal geranium, or garden geranium, is a nothospecies of Pelargonium most commonly used as an ornamental plant. It is a hybrid between Pelargonium zonale and Pelargonium inquinans. They are the group of Pelargonium cultivars, with leaves marked with a brown annular zone and inflorescence in the form of large balls of tight flowers, usually red, pink, or white. These are the most common geraniums of garden centers and florists, sold in pots for windowsills and balconies or planted in flowerbeds.

## Care Guide
Zonal Geraniums flourish in bright light and well-drained conditions, echoing their ancestral home in the open landscapes of Southern Africa. Water thoroughly when the soil is dry to the touch, and provide moderate fertilizer during the growing season for robust health and continuous blooms.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding; fertilize with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer), as native soils may not be consistently rich.
