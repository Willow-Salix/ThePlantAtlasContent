## Introduction
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).

## Care Guide
A native of the central and western US prairies, Soft Aster thrives in full to partial sun and well-draining soil. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and generally requires minimal fertilization once established, making it a low-maintenance choice for native gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average garden soil and generally does not require heavy fertilization; a light annual compost application is usually sufficient.
