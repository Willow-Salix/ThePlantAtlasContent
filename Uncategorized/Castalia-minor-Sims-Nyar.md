## Introduction
Castalia  (Ancient Greek: Κασταλία, romanized: Kastalia), in ancient Greek and Roman mythology, is a young nymph, a daughter of the river-god Achelous who attracted the god Apollo and who is said to have flung herself into the sacred spring in Delphi when pursued by him. The spring took the name Castalia afterwards.

## Care Guide
The Pygmy Waterlily is a temperate aquatic plant that needs a consistently submerged environment in full to partial sun. It requires nutrient-rich soil at its base to flourish and produce its small, delicate flowers, often going dormant in colder winter climates.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in a rich, mucky substrate at the bottom of a pond or container. Benefits from the addition of slow-release aquatic plant fertilizer tablets pushed into the substrate during the growing season.
