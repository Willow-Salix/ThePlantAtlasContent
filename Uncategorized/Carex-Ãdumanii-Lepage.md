## Care Guide
This sedge requires consistently moist to wet soil and full to partial sun to thrive, mimicking its native habitat in open temperate grasslands and wetlands. It is well-suited to consistent watering during its growing season, with minimal fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, but often not necessary in established garden settings.
