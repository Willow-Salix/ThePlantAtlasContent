## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western Europe, particularly Great Britain and Ireland, also found in other temperate regions. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Maritime, thriving in cool, damp, and shaded microclimates, typically on calcareous rocks or soil over lime-rich substrates. |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade. Direct sunlight should be strictly avoided as it can cause rapid desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist conditions. The substrate should remain damp, but good drainage is essential to prevent waterlogging. High ambient humidity is also beneficial. |

## Care Guide
This calcicolous moss thrives in cool, damp, and shaded conditions, mimicking its native temperate maritime microclimates. Ensure constant moisture in the substrate without waterlogging, and provide high humidity. Avoid direct sunlight and refrain from heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Mosses have very low nutrient demands and can be harmed by excessive or concentrated feeding.
