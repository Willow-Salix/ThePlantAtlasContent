## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate and Mediterranean regions across Europe, North America, and other continents, often found in human-modified landscapes. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Mediterranean, frequently found in environments with moderate humidity and temperature, including urban and semi-urban settings. |
| **Sunlight** | High to moderate indirect light. Often grows in exposed locations on tree bark or rocks, receiving significant ambient light, but can also tolerate partial shade. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, high humidity) for hydration, alternating with periods of dryness. Does not absorb water from soil. |

## Introduction
Caloplaca chlorina is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling) crustose lichen in the family Teloschistaceae. It occurs in Europe, where it grows on damp siliceous rocks. This lichen forms dark grey crusts with a bluish tint that break into irregular blocks covered with powdery granules, giving the surface a flour-like appearance. It was first described in 1850 and rarely produces fruiting bodies, but when present they are small with bright yellow to orange centres surrounded by thick grey rims.

## Care Guide
Caloplaca chlorina is a crustose lichen that thrives on specific substrates like nutrient-rich bark and calciferous rocks in temperate to Mediterranean climates. Its 'care' involves providing stable surfaces with atmospheric moisture and appropriate light exposure, as it absorbs water and nutrients directly from its environment. Traditional plant care methods are not applicable.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. This lichen absorbs nutrients directly from the air, rainwater, and its substrate (e.g., bark, rock surface).
