## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Humid tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, including Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Humid Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. Thrives in dappled shade, often found in the understory of dense forests or on mossy surfaces, protected from direct, harsh sun. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity and frequent moisture are essential. Absorbs water directly from the air and surface wetting, requiring consistent damp conditions without prolonged drying out. |

## Introduction
Leptogium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Collemataceae. It has about 110 species. Species formerly classified under Leptogium have since been divided among the genera Leptogium, Pseudoleptogium, and Scytinium. Leptogium lichens are predominantly found on tree bark or soil, often among mosses, and sometimes on rocks in moist environments.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in consistently high humidity and frequent moisture, mimicking its native tropical humid forest environment. It requires low to moderate indirect light and should never be exposed to direct harsh sun. Avoid traditional fertilizers, as it obtains nutrients from the air and rainfall.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and rainfall and can be sensitive to chemical fertilizers and pollutants.
