## Care Guide
James's Ragwort thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its arid native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering only after the soil has completely dried out. Fertilization is generally not necessary, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; may benefit from a very diluted, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring if growth is poor.
