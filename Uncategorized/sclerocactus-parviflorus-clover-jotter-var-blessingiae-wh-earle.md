## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in its native arid scrubland conditions, demanding full sun and extremely infrequent watering. It requires well-draining soil and very little fertilizer, mimicking the lean, rocky soils of its habitat. Ensure a cool, dry dormancy period in winter for best health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization. A balanced, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the active growing season.
