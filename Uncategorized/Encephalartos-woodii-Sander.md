## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (specifically, the Ngoye Forest) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Forest (found on a steep, south-facing slope within a humid gorge environment) |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect light to partial shade. Protect from intense, direct afternoon sun which can scorch its leaves. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture during the growing season, but absolutely critical for excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings; reduce frequency in cooler, dormant months. |

## Introduction
Encephalartos woodii, Wood's cycad, is a rare cycad in the genus Encephalartos, and is endemic to the oNgoye Forest of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It is one of the rarest plants in the world, being extinct in the wild with all specimens being clones of the type. The specific and common name both honour John Medley Wood, curator of the Durban Botanic Garden and director of the Natal Government Herbarium of South Africa, who discovered the plant in 1895.

## Care Guide
Wood's Cycad thrives in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light and consistent, but not excessive, moisture. Mimicking its native subtropical, sheltered gorge environment is key, focusing on humidity and protection from harsh sun. Its extreme rarity and specific needs necessitate careful attention to prevent root rot and ensure proper nutrient balance.

### Fertilizer
A balanced, slow-release fertilizer formulated for cycads or palms should be applied sparingly during the active growing season. Over-fertilization can harm the plant.
