## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe, extending into parts of Western Asia (e.g., Pyrenees, Alps, Carpathians, Balkan Peninsula, Caucasus, Anatolia, Iran) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine to Alpine Meadow (Temperate Montane) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open mountain meadows with high exposure. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Requires consistent moisture during the active growing season but well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging. Can tolerate short dry spells once established. Reduce watering significantly during dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Phleum (common name timothy) is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the grass family. The genus is native to Europe, Asia and north Africa, with one species (P. alpinum) also in North and South America.
They are tufted grasses growing to 20–150 cm tall, with cylindrical, spike-like panicles containing many densely packed spikelets.

## Care Guide
Micheli's Timothy thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native subalpine meadow habitat. It requires moderate watering during its active growth but is sensitive to waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, focusing on gradual nutrient release and soil health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Benefits from a light application of a balanced granular fertilizer in early spring, or an annual top-dressing of compost, particularly in poorer soils. Avoid excessive fertilization.
