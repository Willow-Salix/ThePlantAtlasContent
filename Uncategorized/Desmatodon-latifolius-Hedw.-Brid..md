# Wideleaf Desmatodon Moss

*Desmatodon latifolius (Hedw.) Brid.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and parts of Asia |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest/Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to moderate shade, avoiding direct intense sunlight. Mimics conditions found under a forest canopy or on sheltered rocks. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial, but avoid waterlogging. Regular watering or misting to maintain high humidity, allowing surface to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Desmatodon is an extinct genus of diadectid reptiliomorph. With fossils found from the Kasimovian (Missourian) stage of the Late Carboniferous of Pennsylvania, Colorado, and New Mexico in the United States, Desmatodon is the oldest known diadectid, the group of the first known herbivorous tetrapods. Later members obtained larger sizes, with Desmatodon being somewhat smaller, though its actual size is unknown due to the fragmentary nature of the fossils. Two species are currently recognized: the type species D. hollandi and the species D. hesperis.

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in partial to moderate shade, mimicking its native temperate woodland environment. It requires consistent moisture and high humidity, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Fertilizer is generally not needed due to its low nutrient requirements, making it a low-maintenance plant once established.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses are not heavy feeders and can be sensitive to excessive nutrients. If desired, an extremely diluted liquid fertilizer could be used very sparingly.
