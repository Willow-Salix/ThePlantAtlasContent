| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (southeastern Canada and eastern United States) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest and Wetland/Swamp environments |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives best in full sun for optimal flowering, fruiting, and fall color. |

## Introduction
Aronia arbutifolia, called the red chokeberry, is a North American species of shrubs in the rose family. It is native to eastern Canada and to the eastern and central United States, from eastern Texas to Nova Scotia inland to Ontario, Ohio, Kentucky, and Oklahoma.
Aronia arbutifolia is a branching shrub forming clumps by means of stems forming from the roots. It may reach a height between 1.8 and 3.6 meters (6 and 12 feet). Flowers are white or pink, producing black or bright red fruits. The fruits, whose ill taste inspired the common name, are bitterly acidic (though edible) when eaten raw, but are high in pectin and can be used to make delicious thick jams and jellies.
It is a popular landscaping plant.

## Care Guide
This adaptable plant, thriving in its native temperate forest and wetland habitats, prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist soil, though it's tolerant of both wet feet and drought once established. It typically requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for various landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low. Generally performs well in average to poor soils. A light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring may benefit growth in very poor soils, but it's often not necessary.
