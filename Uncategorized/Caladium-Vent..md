## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical South America, particularly the Amazon Basin (e.g., Brazil, Peru, Colombia) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect bright light to partial shade. Mimics its native understory environment where it receives dappled sunlight through the canopy. Direct sun can scorch the delicate leaves. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during the growing season (spring/summer). Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly before re-watering. High humidity is also crucial, reflecting its rainforest origins. |

## Introduction
Caladium () is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. They are often known by the common name elephant ear (which they share with the closely related genera Alocasia, Colocasia, and Xanthosoma), heart of Jesus, and angel wings. There are over 1000 named cultivars of Caladium bicolor from the original South American plant.
The genus Caladium includes seven species that are native to South America and Central America, and naturalized in India, parts of Africa, and various tropical islands. They grow in open areas of the forest and on the banks of rivers and go dormant during the dry season. The wild plants grow to 15–35 inches (40–90 cm) tall, with leaves mostly 6-18 inches (15–45 cm) long and broad.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Caladiums require conditions that mimic their native tropical rainforests: warm temperatures, high humidity, consistent moisture, and indirect bright light. Ensure good drainage while keeping the soil evenly moist and provide regular feeding during the growing season for vibrant foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to heavy feeder during the active growing season. Use a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks at half strength to support robust foliage growth in its naturally nutrient-rich, organic soil environment.
