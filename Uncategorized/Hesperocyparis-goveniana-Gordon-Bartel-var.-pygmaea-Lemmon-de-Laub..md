## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mendocino County, California, USA |
| **Climate** | Coastal Pygmy Forest within a Mediterranean Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it grows in open, stunted forests with minimal canopy shade. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering during establishment. Tolerant of periods of drought once mature, and also capable of enduring temporary winter waterlogging due to its native hardpan soils, though good drainage is generally preferred in cultivation to prevent root rot. |

## Care Guide
This cypress thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil, despite its native tolerance for poor drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and should be fertilized minimally, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. This plant is adapted to extremely nutrient-poor, acidic soils and does not require rich amendments.
