| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern United States, extending west to some southwestern states. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Freshwater Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun to thrive, indicative of its open wetland habitat. Can tolerate light partial shade but may have reduced vigor. |
| **Watering** | Demands consistently wet to saturated soil, often preferring shallowly submerged conditions. Its native habitat in ephemeral wetlands suggests it can tolerate brief periods of drying, but regular saturation is ideal. |

## Care Guide
Hall's bulrush flourishes in full sun and necessitates consistently wet to submerged soil conditions, mirroring its natural wetland environment. Providing nutrient-rich substrate and maintaining high moisture levels are crucial for its successful cultivation. While it can endure short dry spells, continuous saturation promotes optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; thrives in nutrient-rich soils typical of wetland environments. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or aquatic plant food can be beneficial if grown in sterile media or poor soil.
