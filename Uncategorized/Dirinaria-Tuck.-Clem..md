| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests, Humid Woodlands, and Coastal Areas |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect to partial sun. Avoid harsh, prolonged direct sunlight, which can cause desiccation. Dappled light is ideal. |

## Care Guide
Dirinaria lichens thrive in tropical and subtropical conditions, preferring high humidity and bright indirect light. They absorb moisture and nutrients directly from the air and rain, therefore requiring no traditional watering or fertilization, but consistent moisture in their environment is crucial.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens absorb nutrients directly from the air and precipitation and can be sensitive to chemical fertilizers.
