## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
This California native thrives in full sun within a Mediterranean climate, requiring well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant once established, needing moderate water during its growing season and very little during dry summers. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, fertilizer requirements are minimal, with a preference for low-nitrogen formulations if any are used.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. A light, balanced fertilizer or compost can be applied sparingly if soil is very poor.
