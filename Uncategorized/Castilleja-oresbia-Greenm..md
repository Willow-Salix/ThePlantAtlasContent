| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Wallowa County, Oregon, USA |
| **Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure, typical of open high-altitude environments. |
| **Watering** | Prefers well-drained soil and tolerates dry conditions once established; water sparingly, especially in humid climates, to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
This subalpine native thrives in full sun and lean, well-drained soils, requiring minimal watering once established. Being hemi-parasitic, it does not need and can be harmed by fertilizers, drawing nutrients from host plants instead.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils; avoid fertilization as it is a hemi-parasitic plant and excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
