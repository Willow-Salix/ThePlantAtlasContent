## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, North America, Asia) and parts of Africa |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal, characterized by dry, exposed, rocky or calcareous environments |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating high light levels typical of open habitats and rock surfaces. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering, allowing the substrate to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid prolonged wetness, as it thrives in drier conditions. |

## Introduction
Encalypta is a genus of moss in the family Encalyptaceae; commonly known as "Extinguisher moss". It includes 34 species and is broadly distributed across the continents of America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, as well as Madagascar and New Zealand. The name is derived from the Greek en, meaning in, and kalyptos, which means to cover, veil or lid.

## Care Guide
Mimic its native dry, open, and rocky environment by providing ample light and allowing the substrate to dry out between infrequent waterings. This moss requires minimal nutrients, thriving on neglect rather than rich care, and dislikes prolonged moisture.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required, as mosses have low nutrient demands and are adapted to nutrient-poor environments.
