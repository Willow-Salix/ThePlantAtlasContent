## Care Guide
The Clubhair Mariposa Lily thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean climate, requiring full sun and regular watering during its winter and spring growth period. It is crucial to keep the plant dry during its summer dormancy to prevent bulb rot. Fertilization needs are low to moderate.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly at the beginning of the growing season or none if the soil is adequately rich. Avoid high nitrogen.
