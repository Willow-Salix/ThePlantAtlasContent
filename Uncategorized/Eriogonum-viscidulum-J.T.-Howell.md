## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (Inner North Coast Ranges and adjacent areas) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Arid Scrubland/Chaparral) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed chaparral and woodlands. |
| **Watering** | Very low. Mimic the native dry summers by allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings; extremely drought-tolerant once established and prefers infrequent, deep watering during the cooler months, if at all. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
Sticky Buckwheat, native to California's dry chaparral, requires full sun and exceptionally well-draining soil to thrive. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing very infrequent watering once established, especially during warm, dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal or avoided, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Native to soils that are not rich, it thrives in lean conditions and does not require regular fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
