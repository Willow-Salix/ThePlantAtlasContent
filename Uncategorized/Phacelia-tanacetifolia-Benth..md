## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily California) and northwestern Mexico (Baja California). |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean and Arid/Semi-arid Scrubland. |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure, reflecting its native habitats in open grasslands, disturbed areas, and chaparral where it receives direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Needs moderate watering during germination and active growth. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and prefers infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, consistent with its adaptation to seasonal rainfall. |

## Introduction
Phacelia (phacelia, scorpionweed, heliotrope) is a genus of about 200 species of annual or perennial herbaceous plants in the borage family, native to North and South America. California is particularly rich in species with over 90 recorded in the region.
The genus is traditionally placed at family rank with the waterleafs (Hydrophyllaceae) in the order Boraginales. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, recognizing that the traditional Boraginaceae and Hydrophyllaceae are paraphyletic with respect to each other, merges the latter into the former and considers the family basal in the Euasterids I clade. Other botanists continue to recognize the Hydrophyllaceae and Boraginales after analysing the secondary structure of the ITS1 genetic region rather than its sequence for these higher taxonomic levels.  This placed Phacelia within the Hydrophyllaceae. Further molecular taxonomic analysis of the Boraginales has divided the Boraginales in two and placed Phacelia among the monophyletic herbaceous Hydrophyllaceae in Boraginales II.
The genus includes both annual and perennial species. Many have been cultivated as garden and honey plants.
There are reports that glandular hairs of stems, flowers and leaves of some species of Phacelia secrete oil droplets that can cause an unpleasant skin rash (contact dermatitis) in some people, specifically from P. brachyloba, P. campanularia, P. crenulata, P. gina-glenneae, P. grandiflora, P. ixodes, P. minor, and P. pedicellata. The major contact allergen of P. crenulata has been identified as geranylhydroquinone and of P. minor as geranylgeranylhydroquinone.
The mining bee Andrena phaceliae is a specialist pollinator of this genus in the Eastern United States.

## Care Guide
Lacy Phacelia thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean and arid environments. Provide moderate water during its growing season, then reduce frequency as it tolerates drought. Avoid excessive fertilization as it prefers lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Adapts well to poor to moderately fertile soils and typically does not require heavy fertilization. Excessive nutrients can lead to lush foliage but fewer flowers; a very light, balanced feed might be used only in extremely poor soils.
