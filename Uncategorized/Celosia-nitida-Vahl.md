## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun to partial shade in warm, tropical and subtropical climates. It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture during its active growth but can tolerate short dry periods once established, with minimal need for heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. Thrives in average garden soil without heavy fertilization; a light application of balanced fertilizer once in spring is sufficient.
