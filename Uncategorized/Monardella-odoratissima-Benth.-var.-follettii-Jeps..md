## Care Guide
This plant thrives in a Mediterranean climate, requiring full sun to partial shade and very well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing minimal water, especially during dry summer months. Avoid overwatering and heavy fertilization to ensure its health.

### Fertilizer
Very low; adapted to lean, rocky, or sandy soils. Does not require regular fertilization, as rich soil can be detrimental.
