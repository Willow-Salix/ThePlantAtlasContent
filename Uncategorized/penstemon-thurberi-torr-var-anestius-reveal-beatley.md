| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |

## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted penstemon requires full sun and thrives in well-drained, lean soils. Water infrequently and deeply once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. Avoid excessive fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor desert soils, and over-fertilization can be detrimental.
