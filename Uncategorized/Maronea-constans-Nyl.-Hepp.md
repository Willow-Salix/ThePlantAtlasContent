## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in environments mimicking its temperate forest origin, needing moderate light and high humidity. Ensure regular access to atmospheric moisture and good air circulation, while avoiding direct, harsh sun and chemical fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required, as lichens absorb necessary nutrients from air, rain, and their substrate. Chemical fertilizers can be harmful.
