## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (California, Oregon, Nevada, Idaho) |
| **Climate** | Montane/Subalpine Riparian Zones and Moist Meadows in Temperate Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers brighter light for optimal flowering, especially in cooler regions. In hotter climates, some afternoon shade can prevent stress. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil is crucial; requires frequent watering, mimicking its native habitat near streams and seeps. The soil should never be allowed to dry out completely, but good drainage is also important to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
Grant's Monkeyflower thrives in bright, consistently moist conditions, much like its native montane riparian zones. Provide full to partial sun and ensure the soil remains damp, along with moderate fertilization during its growth period, to encourage healthy foliage and vibrant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer), typically every 2-4 weeks. Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler, dormant periods.
