## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Florida, USA (Southeastern United States) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light or dappled sun. Can tolerate some direct morning sun but should be protected from harsh afternoon sun to prevent leaf burn. |
| **Watering** | Being epiphytic, it absorbs water from humidity and rainfall. In cultivation, mist daily or soak the plant in non-chlorinated water for 20-30 minutes weekly, ensuring it dries completely within 4 hours to prevent rot. |

## Introduction
Tillandsia is a genus of around 650 species of evergreen, perennial flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae, native to the forests, mountains and deserts of the Neotropics, from northern Mexico and the southeastern United States to Mesoamerica and the Caribbean to central Argentina. Their leaves, more or less silvery in color, are covered with specialized cells (trichomes) capable of rapidly absorbing water that gathers on them.
They are also commonly known as air plants because they obtain nutrients and water from the air, not needing soil for nourishment. They have a natural propensity to cling to whatever surfaces are readily available: telephone wires, tree branches, bark, bare rocks, etc. Their light seeds and a silky parachute facilitate their spread.  Most Tillandsia species are epiphytes – which translates to 'upon a plant'. Some are aerophytes, which have a minimal root system and grow on shifting desert soil. Due to their epiphytic way of life, these plants will not grow in soil but live on the branches of trees, in deserts and on other substrates that will not be saturated with water for very long.

## Care Guide
This Tillandsia thrives in bright, indirect light and high humidity, typical of its native Florida. Ensure regular watering via misting or soaking, allowing the plant to dry thoroughly afterward. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted, bromeliad-specific solution during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Provide a very diluted (1/4 strength) bromeliad-specific liquid fertilizer monthly or bi-monthly during the growing season, applied through misting or soaking.
