## 🌱 Overview
Chrysopsis (golden asters) are plants in the family Asteraceae native to the southern and eastern United States. All the species are found in Florida, although some are found in other states as well.
These are annual and perennial herbs bearing daisy-like flower heads with yellow disc florets and usually yellow ray florets. Some species formerly classified in this genus are now included in other genera: Heterotheca, Pityopsis, Stenotus, Ionactis, Aster, Eucephalus, Erigeron, Machaeranthera, Croptilon, Xanthisma, Oclemena, Bradburia, Oxypappus, Arnica, and Helichrysopsis.
Golden asters are often used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Schinia petulans (which feeds exclusively on C. subulata).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, indicative of its native temperate dry scrubland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization once established, mirroring its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires very low fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
