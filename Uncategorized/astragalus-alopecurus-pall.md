## 🧤 Care Instructions
Native to the temperate steppes, Foxtail Milk-vetch thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil, tolerating drought conditions. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it needs minimal fertilization, preferably a balanced formula if supplemented.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
