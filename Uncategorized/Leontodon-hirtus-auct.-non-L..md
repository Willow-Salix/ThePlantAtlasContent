## Introduction
Leontodon saxatilis is a species of hawkbit known by the common names lesser hawkbit, rough hawkbit, and hairy hawkbit. It is native to Europe and North Africa but can be found in many other places across the globe as an introduced species and often a noxious weed. This is a dandelion-like herb growing patches of many erect, leafless stems from a basal rosette of leaves. The leaves are 2 to 15 centimeters long, 0.5 to 2.5 centimeters wide, entire or lobed, and green in color. Atop the stems are solitary flower heads which are ligulate, containing layered rings of ray florets with no disc florets. The florets are yellow with toothed tips. The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus of scales. Fruits near the center of the flower head are rough, while those growing along the edges of the head are smooth.

## Care Guide
Provide full to partial sun exposure and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, as it's tolerant of drier conditions. Fertilizer needs are low, thriving in poor to average soils. Focus on well-drained conditions to mimic its temperate grassland origins.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils, so excessive feeding is unnecessary and can be detrimental.
