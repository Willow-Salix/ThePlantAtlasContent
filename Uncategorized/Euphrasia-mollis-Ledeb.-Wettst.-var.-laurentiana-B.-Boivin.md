## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Canada (Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia) and Northeastern United States (e.g., Maine), particularly associated with the St. Lawrence River valley and coastal regions. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate to Boreal Wetland/Bogland, characterized by moist, often acidic, peaty soils in open areas. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. As it thrives in open bog and marsh habitats, it requires good light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil. It should never be allowed to dry out, mimicking its natural boggy environment. |

## Introduction
Euphrasia, or eyebright, is a genus of about 215 species of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae (formerly included in the Scrophulariaceae), with a cosmopolitan distribution. They are hemiparasitic on grasses and other plants. Both the common and generic names refer to the plant's use in a lotion for treating eye infections, with Euphrasia literally meaning 'good-cheer'.
Many species are found in alpine or sub-alpine meadows where snow is common. Flowers usually are borne terminally, are zygomorphic, and have a lower petal shaped like a lip. The most common flower colours are purple, blue-white, and violet. Some species have yellow markings on the lower petal to act as a guide to pollinating insects.
Alternative names, mainly in herbalism, are Augentrostkraut, Euphrasiae herba, Herba Euphrasiae and Herbe d'Euphraise.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full to partial sun with consistently wet, acidic, and nutrient-poor soil, mimicking its native bog and marsh habitats. Ensure the soil never dries out and avoid over-fertilization, which can harm this bog specialist.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. Native bog soils are typically low in nutrients and acidic, so rich fertilizers would be detrimental. Use a very dilute, low-phosphorus, acid-formulating fertilizer if needed.
