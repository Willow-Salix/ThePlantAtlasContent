## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant grass thrives in full sun and nutrient-poor, dry soils, characteristic of its native arid and semi-arid habitats. It requires very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and generally no fertilizer. Mimicking its desert environment by providing ample sunlight and sparse watering is key to its cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. This grass is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy or stony soils and does not require regular fertilization.
