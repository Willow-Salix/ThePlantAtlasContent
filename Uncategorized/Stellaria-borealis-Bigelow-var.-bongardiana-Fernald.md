## Care Guide
Northern Starwort thrives in cool, moist conditions characteristic of boreal and subalpine regions. It requires consistently wet soil and prefers partial sun, though it can tolerate full sun in cool climates. Fertilization needs are low; provide a light feeding annually if necessary.

### Fertilizer
