## 🧤 Care Instructions
This sedge thrives in consistently wet conditions, requiring continuously moist to wet soil to replicate its marshy native habitat. It prefers full sun to partial sun exposure for optimal growth. Fertilizer needs are low to moderate, benefiting from organic matter but adaptable to various soil fertility levels.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from organically rich soil but is generally not a heavy feeder and can tolerate less fertile, waterlogged conditions.
