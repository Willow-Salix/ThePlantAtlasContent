## Care Guide
Reed's Ephedra thrives in full sun exposure and is exceptionally drought-tolerant, requiring very little water. It prefers well-draining soil and has minimal fertilizer requirements, reflecting its adaptation to arid desert environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. If necessary, a single application of a dilute, balanced fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none at all if planted in native-like lean soil.
