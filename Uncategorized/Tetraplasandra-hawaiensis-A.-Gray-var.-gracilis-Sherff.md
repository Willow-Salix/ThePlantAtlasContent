# Hawaiian Ohe

*Tetraplasandra hawaiensis A. Gray var. gracilis Sherff* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands, USA |
| **Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade, mimicking the dappled light of a forest understory. Avoid harsh, direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is key; water regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. Avoid letting the plant sit in standing water. |

## Introduction
Tetraplasandra is a no longer recognised genus of plants in the ivy family, Araliaceae. They are small to medium trees, (rarely shrubs or large trees) of mesic to wet forests.
Some authors have recognized as many as 19 species in Tetraplasandra, while others have recognized as few as six. In 2007, the authors of a scientific paper recommended that the genus be divided into nine species. In 2010, all of these nine species were included in Polyscias subgenus Tetraplasandra, a subgenus of 21 species in the large genus Polyscias, which will comprise about 250 species, when about 90 undescribed species are published.
The range of variation in Tetraplasandra is unusually large for a genus in Araliaceae  Most of the species were originally described in other genera which were later merged with Tetraplasandra.
The type species for the genus is T. hawaiensis.
As defined by William R. Philipson in 1970, Tetraplasandra is endemic to Hawaii and occurs on six of the eight main islands. Niʻihau and Kahoʻolawe are low-lying and dry; consequently, they do not support Tetraplasandra. T. oahuensis, T. kavaiensis, and T. hawaiensis are found on six, five, and four of the islands, respectively. The other species are single-island endemics.
T. oahuensis and T.kavaiensis have done well in cultivation in Southern California. They are sensitive to heat, but very tolerant of shade, and they need some wind protection. In horticulture, T. kavaiensis has often been misidentified as T. meiandra. True T. meiandra is now treated as a synonym of T. oahuensis.
T. gymnocarpa, a rare tree of Oʻahu, is considered an oddity, since it is the only species in Araliaceae whose flowers have a completely superior ovary.
The genus Tetraplasandra has long been known as a close relative of the obsolete genera Gastonia, Reynoldsia, and Munroidendron. This was confirmed by a pollen study in 1971. In 2010, those four genera, along with Arthrophyllum and Cuphocarpus, were all sunk into Polyscias, raising the number of species in that genus from about 100 to 159.
Four Hawaiian names are applied to groups of Tetraplasandra species. T. hawaiensis is known as ʻohe. T. kavaiensis and T. gymnocarpa are called ʻoheʻohe. T. waimeae is called ʻohe kikoʻola. T. oahuensis and T. lydgatei are called ʻohe mauka. The related name, ʻohe makai, is applied to Polyscias sandwicensis, formerly known as Reynoldsia sandwicensis. These names closely correspond to clades currently recognized within Tetraplasandra.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian Ohe thrives in conditions similar to its native tropical moist forest habitat. Provide bright, indirect light and maintain consistent soil moisture, ensuring good drainage. Feed moderately during its active growth period to support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, or a slow-release granular fertilizer, to support growth in nutrient-rich forest-like conditions.
