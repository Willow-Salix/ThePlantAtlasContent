## Introduction
Tetraneuris, commonly known as four-nerve daisy or bitterweed, is a genus of North American plants in the sneezeweed tribe within the daisy family.
The genus includes one annual species, Tetraneuris linearifolia, with all the other species being perennials.
The name is of Greek origin, deriving from tetra, meaning "four", and neuron, meaning "nerve", which refers to the venation of the rays: three-lobed with the outer lobes themselves having an apparent vein down the middle.

## Care Guide
Lakeside Tetraneuris is a resilient plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native semi-arid grasslands. Provide infrequent but deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between sessions, and avoid heavy fertilization to maintain its vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in lean soils and may benefit from a very light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring if growth is poor.
