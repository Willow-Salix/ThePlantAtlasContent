| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., California, Arizona) and Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland to Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; adapted to high light exposure typical of exposed rocks in arid regions. |

## Introduction
Buellia is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Caliciaceae. The fungi are usually part of a crustose lichen. In this case, the lichen species is given the same name as the fungus. But members may also grow as parasites on lichens (lichenicolous). The algae in the lichen (the photobiont partner) is always a member of the genus Trebouxia.
Lichens in the genus are commonly called disc lichens, or button lichens. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains almost 1000 species.
Genetic studies indicate that the genus Amandinea and Buellia may be the same, although this is not widely accepted.
The genus Buellia was described by Italian botanist Gioseppe De Notaris in 1846 and named after his friend, Esperanzo Buelli.

## Care Guide
This crustose lichen thrives in dry, sunny environments, typically on exposed rocks. It requires very infrequent moisture, relying on atmospheric humidity and occasional precipitation, and does not need any supplemental fertilization.

### Fertilizer
None; lichens are self-sufficient symbiotic organisms that derive nutrients from the atmosphere and substrate.
