## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Indian subcontinent (e.g., India, Nepal, Bangladesh) and Southeast Asia (e.g., Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to moderate indirect light. In its native habitat, it often grows in the understory or sub-canopy, protected from direct, harsh sun. |
| **Watering** | Regular and consistent watering, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out slightly between waterings, mimicking tropical rainfall patterns with occasional drier spells. |

## Introduction
Symplocos is a genus of flowering plants in the order Ericales. It contains about 300 species distributed in Asia and the Americas. Many species grow in humid tropical regions. This is sometimes considered to be the only genus in family Symplocaceae. Plants in this family are shrubs and trees with white or yellow flowers. The oldest fossils of the genus date to the lower Eocene of Europe and North America, with the genus being present in Europe as late as the Pliocene. Fossil seeds of †Symplocos granulosa are frequent in sediment rock layers of the Late Oligocene to the Late Miocene of Denmark, Germany, Austria and Poland. The fossil seeds are very similar to the seeds of the extan southern Chinese species Symplocos glandulifera and Symplocos sulcata. Fossil seeds of  †Symplocos paucicostata are known from the Middle Pliocene sediment rock layers in Reuver, the Netherlands and from the Late Pliocene sediment rock layers in northern Italy. The fossil seeds are very similar to the seeds of the extant East Asian species Symplocos paniculata.

## Care Guide
Lodhtree thrives in conditions that mimic its native subtropical/tropical moist forest environment. Provide partial shade, consistently moist but well-draining soil, and moderate fertilization during active growth periods. Ensuring high ambient humidity will also contribute to its health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring through summer) with a balanced, organic-rich fertilizer. Native forest soils are generally fertile from decaying organic matter.
