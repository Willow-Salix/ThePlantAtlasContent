### *Epilichen scabrosus (Ach.) Clem. ex Hafellner*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including temperate to subarctic areas of Europe, North America, and Greenland, typically in mountainous or exposed rocky habitats. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate to Subarctic, found in Alpine Tundra, Montane regions, and Boreal rocky outcrops. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, as it grows on exposed siliceous rocks. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies on intermittent natural moisture from rainfall, fog, and dew; highly tolerant of prolonged dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Epilichen is a small genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Rhizocarpaceae. These parasitic lichens live on other lichens, beginning as thin, crust-like patches that may break into small islands or scales, and in some cases produce no visible body at all except for their reproductive structures. They reproduce through black, disc-shaped fruiting bodies that contain distinctive brown spores with a "doughnut ring" appearance, and can eventually take over the space occupied by their host lichen once it dies.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Epilichen scabrosus is a specialized lichen that thrives in cool, exposed, rocky environments. It requires significant light exposure and obtains all its moisture from atmospheric humidity and precipitation. No artificial watering or fertilization is needed, as it grows symbiotically on other lichens and is highly self-sufficient.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. As a lichenicolous lichen, it derives nutrients from its host lichen and the atmosphere.
