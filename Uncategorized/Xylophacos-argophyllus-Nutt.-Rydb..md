## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically the Great Basin region, including states like Nevada, Utah, California, Arizona, Oregon, Idaho) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Semi-Arid Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to mimic its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low watering; it is highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between infrequent waterings, as excessive moisture will lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Astragalus is a large genus of over 3,000 species of herbs and small shrubs, belonging to the legume family Fabaceae and the subfamily Faboideae. It is the largest genus of plants in terms of described species. The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Common names include milkvetch (most species), locoweed (in North America, some species) and goat's-thorn (A. gummifer, A. tragacantha). Some pale-flowered vetches (Vicia spp.) are similar in appearance, but they are more vine-like than Astragalus.

## Care Guide
Silverleaf Milkvetch thrives in conditions similar to its native arid scrublands, requiring full sun and very well-drained soil. Provide infrequent watering once established, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly, and avoid heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. This plant is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of arid environments.
