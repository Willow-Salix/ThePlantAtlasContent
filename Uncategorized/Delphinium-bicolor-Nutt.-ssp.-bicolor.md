| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving with at least 6 hours of direct sun daily for optimal flowering. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Keep soil consistently moist during active growth (spring through early summer), allowing the top inch or two to dry out between waterings. Drought tolerant once established. |

## Introduction
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in temperate climates with full sun and well-draining soil. Provide moderate water during its active growth period in spring and early summer, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and keep fertilization minimal. It is well-adapted to drier conditions once established and prefers not to be over-fed.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. If planted in poor soil, apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in early spring. Avoid over-fertilization, which can lead to leggy growth.
