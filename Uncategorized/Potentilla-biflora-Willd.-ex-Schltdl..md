## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia, including Siberia, Central Asia (e.g., Altai Mountains, Himalayas), Mongolia, and parts of China. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in open, exposed alpine and arctic habitats without tree cover. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture, especially during the growing season, mimicking snowmelt. Soil should be well-draining to prevent waterlogging in cold conditions. |

## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and cool temperatures, adapting well to exposed conditions. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil during its short growing season, preferably from snowmelt simulation. Fertilization should be minimal or avoided due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor alpine soils and does not require rich fertilization.
