## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its native coastal grasslands and scrub. It requires moderate watering during its active growth period but is highly drought-tolerant once established, accustomed to dry Mediterranean summers. Fertilization is rarely needed as it adapts well to average to poor soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to None; thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization.
