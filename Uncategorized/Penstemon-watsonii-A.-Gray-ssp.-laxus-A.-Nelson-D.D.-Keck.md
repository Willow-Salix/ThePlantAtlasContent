| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Great Basin region (Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Wyoming) |
| **Climate** | Arid Montane Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours direct sunlight daily) to very light partial shade. |
| **Watering** | Low; highly drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This subspecies of Watson's Penstemon, native to the arid montane shrublands of the Great Basin, thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, mimicking its native habitat. Avoid over-fertilization to ensure vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a light, balanced slow-release formula in spring only if soil is very poor.
