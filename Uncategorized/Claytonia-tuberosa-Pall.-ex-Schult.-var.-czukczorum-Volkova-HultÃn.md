## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Russian Far East (Chukotka Peninsula) |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, mimicking the open, exposed conditions of the tundra during its short, intense growing season. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture during its active growth period, typically from spring snowmelt and summer rains; however, excellent drainage is crucial to prevent tuber rot. Allow soil to dry out completely during its dormant phase. |

## Introduction
Claytonia (spring beauty) is a genus of flowering plants native to Asia, North America, and Central America. The vitamin-rich leaves can be eaten raw or cooked, and the tubers can be prepared like potatoes.

## Care Guide
This tundra native thrives with ample light and consistent moisture during its brief spring/summer growing period, followed by a dry dormancy. Ensure excellent drainage to protect its tuberous roots. Minimal to no fertilization is required due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer is needed, as its native tundra soils are naturally poor in nutrients.
