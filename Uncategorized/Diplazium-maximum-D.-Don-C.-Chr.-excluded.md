## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Assam, Bangladesh, East Himalaya, India, Laccadive Islands, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; avoid direct sunlight, mimicking its native understory environment where it receives dappled or filtered light. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial. Keep the soil continuously moist but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, reflecting its habitat with regular, ample rainfall. |

## Introduction
Diplazium is a genus of ferns that specifically includes the approximately 400 known species of twinsorus ferns.  The Greek root is diplazein meaning double: the indusia in this genus lie on both sides of the vein.  These ferns were earlier considered part of either the Athyriaceae, Dryopteridaceae, Aspleniaceae, or Polypodiaceae families or recognized as belonging to their own taxonomic family. The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) places the genus in the Athyriaceae. The taxonomy of the genus is difficult and poorly known, and by 2009 has never been the subject of a complete monographic study. Their distribution is pantropical, with a few species extending into temperate areas.
The rhizome of the genus Diplazium varies from creeping to erect, and is scaly.  Its fronds are deciduous or evergreen, are trophopodic and are either monomorphic or weakly dimorphic.  The stipe is green, deeply grooved from above, and is either scaly or glabrous.  It always has two lunate vascular bundles.  The blades are either singular or in sets of two and are entirely pinnate, range from oblong-lanceolate to deltate, and from herbaceous to papery.  It has linear basal sori that are paired back-to-back on the same vein.  The indusium is linear and persistent, and the sporangia are brownish.
Some common species include Diplazium hymenodes, the peacock fern; Diplazium esculentum, the vegetable fern; Diplazium molokaiense, the Molokai twinsorus fern; and Diplazium lonchophyllum, the lance-leaved glade fern.

## Care Guide
This fern thrives in conditions that mimic its native tropical and subtropical forest understory. Provide consistent soil moisture, high ambient humidity, and filtered indirect light. Fertilize lightly during the active growing period.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize sparingly with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season. Forest understories provide nutrients from decaying organic matter, so ferns are not heavy feeders.
