## Care Guide
Gundlachia thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, preferring to dry out between waterings. It requires minimal fertilization, reflecting its adaptation to poor, sandy or rocky native soils. Ensure excellent drainage to mimic its natural coastal scrub habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low; minimal fertilization needed, especially if planted in poor to average soil. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth is poor.
