## Care Guide
Tobosa Grass is a resilient, drought-tolerant plant best suited for full sun exposure and minimal watering. It thrives in lean soils, thus requiring little to no fertilization. The primary care strategy is to replicate its native arid environment, focusing on dry conditions and abundant light.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally does not require regular fertilization as it thrives in nutrient-poor, lean soils.
