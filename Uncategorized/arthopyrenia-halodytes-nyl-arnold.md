## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal regions globally, including Europe, North America, Australia, and South Africa |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Marine Intertidal Zone |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure during low tide periods; submerged and partially shaded by water during high tide |
| **💧 Water** | Regular submersion in highly saline seawater during high tide, followed by periods of desiccation during low tide |

## 🌱 Overview
Arthopyrenia is a genus of fungi in the family Trypetheliaceae. It was formerly classified in the eponymic family Arthopyreniaceae, but molecular phylogenetics studies showed that the type species, Arthopyrenia cerasi, was a member of the Trypetheliaceae. Arthopyrenia fungi typically form inconspicuous films embedded within tree bark and produce tiny, flask-shaped fruiting bodies covered by dark, shield-like caps. The genus includes both lichen-forming species (those that partner with algae) and non-lichenized species, with about 100 currently recognized species found primarily on bark and wood substrates.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This is a marine lichen, not a typical plant, requiring a highly specialized environment simulating the intertidal zone. It thrives on siliceous rocks with alternating periods of full sun exposure and submersion in highly saline seawater. Traditional plant care methods are not applicable.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Nutrients obtained from dissolved minerals in seawater and the rock substrate; traditional fertilizers are not applicable
