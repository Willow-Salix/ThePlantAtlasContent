## 🌱 Overview
Rhus sandwicensis, commonly known as neneleau, neleau or Hawaiian sumac, is a species of flowering plant in the cashew family, Anacardiaceae, that is endemic to Hawaii. It is small tree, reaching a height of 4.5–7.5 m (15–25 ft) and a trunk diameter of 10–30 cm (3.9–11.8 in). Neneleau inhabits dry, coastal mesic, mixed mesic and wet forests at elevations of 180–610 m (590–2,000 ft) on all main islands.
The Latin specific epithet of sandwicensis refers to the "Sandwich Islands," as the Hawaiian Islands were once called, and named by James Cook on one of his voyages in the 1770s. James Cook named the islands after John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich for supporting Cook's voyages.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Neneleau thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering. Provide light fertilization during growth to support its resilience in Hawaiian dry to mesic conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula during active growth, or enrich soil with organic matter. Established plants often require minimal feeding.
