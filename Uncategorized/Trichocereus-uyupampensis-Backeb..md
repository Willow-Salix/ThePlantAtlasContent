## Care Guide
This high-altitude Bolivian cactus requires full, intense sun and extremely well-draining soil to mimic its native arid montane habitat. Water sparingly, allowing complete drying between applications, and apply a dilute cactus fertilizer only during the active growing season.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. Fertilize once or twice during the active growing season with a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer.
