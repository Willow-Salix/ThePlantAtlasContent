## Introduction
Dicranum is a genus of mosses, also called wind-blown mosses or fork mosses. 
These mosses form in densely packed clumps. Stems may fork, but do not branch. In general, upright stems will be single but packed together. Dicranum is distributed globally. In North America these are commonly found in Jack pine or Red pine stands.

## Care Guide
This resilient moss thrives in partial sun to partial shade with consistent moisture and excellent drainage. It prefers low-nutrient, sandy or rocky substrates, reflecting its adaptation to open, boreal, and montane environments.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; thrives in low-nutrient environments and can be sensitive to high fertilizer concentrations.
