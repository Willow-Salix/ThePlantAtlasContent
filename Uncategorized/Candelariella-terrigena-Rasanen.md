## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal and Arctic-alpine regions, including Northern Europe (Fennoscandia), North America (Canada, Alaska), and Greenland, often on calcareous substrates. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Alpine Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure. This lichen thrives in open, exposed environments with ample light, typical of tundra landscapes above the treeline or in northern latitudes. |
| **💧 Water** | Intermittent moisture, allowing for periods of complete dryness. Lichens absorb water directly from the air and rain/snowmelt; they are highly tolerant of desiccation. Avoid constant saturation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Candelariella is a genus of bright yellow, ocher, or greenish yellow crustose or squamulose lichens in the family Candelariaceae. Members of the genus are commonly called eggyolk lichens, goldspeck lichens, or yolk lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Eggyolk Lichen, provide high light exposure and ensure cold, airy conditions, mimicking its native arctic-alpine habitat. Offer intermittent moisture, allowing for dry periods, and never fertilize, as lichens are sensitive to excess nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. Lichens do not require traditional fertilization and can be harmed by nutrient-rich conditions. They derive necessary elements from the air and substrate.
