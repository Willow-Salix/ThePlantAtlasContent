## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (USA, Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Wetland/Riparian |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Shade (indirectly, as it grows on host plants typically found in these conditions) |
| **Watering** | High (consistently moist soil for the host plant, reflecting its native wetland habitats) |

## Introduction
Cuscuta (), commonly known as dodder or amarbel, is a genus of over 201 species of yellow, orange, or red (rarely green) parasitic plants. Formerly treated as the only genus in the family Cuscutaceae, it now is accepted as belonging in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae, on the basis of the work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world, with the greatest species diversity in subtropical and tropical regions; the genus becomes rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern Europe.
Folk names include strangle tare, strangleweed, scaldweed, beggarweed, lady's laces, fireweed, wizard's net, devil's guts, devil's hair, devil's ringlet, goldthread, hailweed, hairweed, hellbine, love vine, pull-down, angel hair, and witch's hair.

## Care Guide
Cuscuta gronovii var. curta is a parasitic vine native to moist, temperate regions of North America, where it thrives by drawing nutrients from host plants in full sun to partial shade. Its 'care' primarily involves the health of its host, which typically requires consistently moist soil conditions. As a parasitic species, it does not require supplemental fertilization.

### Fertilizer
None (as it is a parasitic plant that obtains all necessary nutrients from its host)
