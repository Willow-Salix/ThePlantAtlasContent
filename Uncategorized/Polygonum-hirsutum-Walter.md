## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, Alabama) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Wetlands, Marshes, Ditches) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in open, well-lit wet environments typical of marsh edges and ditches. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently wet to moist soil, mimicking its native wetland habitat. Never allow the soil to dry out completely; can tolerate standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hairy Smartweed thrives in conditions similar to its native southeastern US wetlands, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently wet soil. Ensure the plant never dries out and provide moderate fertilization during its active growth for best results.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied during the growing season is beneficial, especially if soil nutrients are lacking. Native habitats often supply adequate organic matter.
