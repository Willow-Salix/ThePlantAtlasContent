## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern California, USA (specifically San Diego County) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate / Arid Scrubland (Chaparral and Coastal Sage Scrub) |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun exposure to thrive, typical of its open, scrubland habitat where it receives direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely drought-tolerant, adapted to dry summers and mild, wet winters. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during its dry summer dormancy. Overwatering is detrimental. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chorizanthe is a genus of plants in the buckwheat family known generally as spineflowers. These are small, squat, herbaceous plants with spiny-looking inflorescences of flowers. The flowers may be in shades of red or yellow to white. The bracts are pointed and sometimes tipped with a hooked awn, and the inflorescence often dries into a rounded, spiny husk. Spineflowers are found in western North America and South America.
Name derivation: The word Chorizanthe comes from the Greek roots chorizo and anthos meaning "to divide," and "flower," thus meaning "divided flowers," but actually used in reference to the divided calyx.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Ramona Spineflower thrives in full sun and exceptionally well-draining, lean soil, mimicking its native Southern California scrublands. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering that aligns with natural winter rainfall, and should not be fertilized.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in poor, rocky, and well-draining soils. Supplemental fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful, as it is adapted to nutrient-lean conditions.
