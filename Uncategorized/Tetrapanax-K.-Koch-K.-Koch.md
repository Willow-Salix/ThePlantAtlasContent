## Introduction
Tetrapanax papyrifer, the rice paper plant (通草—tong cao), is an evergreen shrub or small tree in the family Araliaceae, the sole species in the genus Tetrapanax. The specific epithet is frequently misspelled as "papyriferum", "papyriferus", or "papyrifera". It is native to eastern and central China and Taiwan, but widely cultivated in East Asia and in other tropical to mild temperate regions as well.
The species was first described in the genus Aralia as Aralia papyrifera, and has also been treated in Fatsia as Fatsia papyrifera.
A second species, Tetrapanax tibetanus, is now regarded as a synonym of Merrilliopanax alpinus.

## Care Guide
Tetrapanax thrives in bright, indirect to partial sun conditions with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its subtropical to tropical native habitat. Fertilize regularly during the growing season to support its vigorous growth, reducing frequency in cooler months.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeder. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring to late summer).
