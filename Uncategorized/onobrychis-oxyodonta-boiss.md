## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils typical of its native semi-arid steppe and montane environments. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and generally requires minimal watering and fertilization due to its adaptation to harsh conditions and nitrogen-fixing ability.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. If grown in very poor soil, a balanced, low-dose fertilizer once in spring might be beneficial, but generally not required.
