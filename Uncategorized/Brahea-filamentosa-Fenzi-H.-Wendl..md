## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Arizona) and Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert Oasis |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it grows in open, exposed desert environments and canyons. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out between deep waterings. Though drought-tolerant once established, it naturally occurs near perennial water sources and thrives with regular moisture. |

## Introduction
Washingtonia filifera, commonly known as the California fan palm, or desert fan palm, is a flowering plant in the family Arecaceae, native to the far southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It typically grows 15–20 m (49–66 ft) tall and 3–6 m (10–20 ft) wide, with a sturdy, columnar trunk and waxy, fan-shaped (palmate) leaves. As a monocot, it is evergreen and exhibits a tree-like growth habit.
It is the only palm species native to the southwestern United States, forming groves around perennial water sources in the Colorado, Mojave, and Sonoran deserts. These stands provide critical habitat for wildlife and were historically used by Indigenous peoples of the region for food, shelter, and materials. Today the California fan palm is widely planted as an ornamental tree in arid and subtropical climates, though wild populations face pressures from groundwater decline, and habitat alteration.
In California, where the majority of its native groves occur, the species forms iconic desert oases such as the Oasis of Mara in Joshua Tree National Park, the Thousand Palms Oasis in the Coachella Valley Preserve, Lost Palms Oasis, and Fortynine Palms Oasis. Outside California, notable populations are protected at Castle Creek in Arizona's Bradshaw Mountains, the Hassayampa River Preserve, and Kofa National Wildlife Refuge.

## Care Guide
The California Fan Palm, native to desert oases, requires full sun and thrives in well-draining soil. While highly drought-tolerant once established, it benefits greatly from regular, deep watering to support its growth. Fertilize lightly with a palm-specific blend during the active growing season.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, using a slow-release, palm-specific fertilizer during the growing season. It is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils.
