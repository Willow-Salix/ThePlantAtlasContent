## Care Guide
Beardless Wildrye is a resilient, drought-tolerant grass native to arid steppes of Western North America, thriving in full sun. It requires minimal watering once established, preferring deep but infrequent irrigation that allows the soil to dry. Fertilization is generally not necessary, as it adapts well to less fertile conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils and does not require heavy fertilization.
