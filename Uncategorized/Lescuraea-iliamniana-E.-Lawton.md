*Lescuraea iliamniana E. Lawton* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Alaska, USA (North America) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Tundra, Boreal Forest margins (often in cool, moist, rocky areas) |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light to deep shade. Avoid any direct sunlight as it can scorch the moss. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and a constantly moist substrate. Do not allow to dry out between waterings. Regular misting is highly beneficial. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in very low light and high humidity, mimicking its cool, shaded native habitat. Maintain a consistently moist substrate and mist frequently, ensuring it never dries out. Fertilizer is generally not required and should be avoided or applied very sparingly if at all.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to none. Mosses typically absorb nutrients from water and air; too much fertilizer can be detrimental.
