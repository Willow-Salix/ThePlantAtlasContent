## Care Guide
This resilient desert native thrives on neglect, preferring full sun and well-draining soil. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as it is adapted to poor, rocky soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally not needed. If soil is very poor, a light, balanced fertilizer once in spring may be beneficial.
