## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bush Vetchling thrives in sunny conditions typical of its native temperate grasslands. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and becomes drought-tolerant once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it needs minimal fertilization, preferring well-draining soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it does not require heavy nitrogen fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil is poor.
