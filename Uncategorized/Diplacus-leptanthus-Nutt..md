## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (Central and Southern California) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean / Arid Scrubland / Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure is preferred, replicating its native open, sunny habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low watering needs; it is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to dry conditions. Water infrequently once established, especially during the dry summer months. |

## Introduction
Diplacus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. It includes 49 species native to the western United States and northwestern Mexico. Most prefer dry and rocky areas.
The genus Diplacus was first described by Thomas Nuttall in 1838. It was merged into Mimulus no later than 1905, until the 2012 restructuring. The 2012 restructuring of Mimulus by Barker, et al., based largely upon DNA evidence, left seven species in Mimulus, placed 111 into Erythranthe (species with axile placentation and long pedicels), placed 46 into Diplacus (species with parietal placentation and sessile flowers), placed two in Uvedalia, and placed one each in Elacholoma, Mimetanthe, and Thyridia.

## Care Guide
For optimal care, provide full sun exposure and minimal watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in summer. Avoid excessive fertilization as it is adapted to lean soils. This plant is well-suited for drought-tolerant gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor soils characteristic of chaparral environments.
