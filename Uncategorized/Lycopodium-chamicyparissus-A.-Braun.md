## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | High-altitude regions of Central and South America, including Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Cloud Forest or Páramo |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Avoid direct, harsh sunlight, which can scorch its delicate foliage. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist conditions, but excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot. High ambient humidity is essential, often requiring frequent misting or placement in a terrarium/humidity tray. |

## Introduction
Lycopodium (from Ancient Greek lykos, wolf and podion, diminutive of pous, foot) is a genus of clubmosses, also known as ground pines or creeping cedars, in the family Lycopodiaceae. Two very different circumscriptions of the genus are in use. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Lycopodium is one of nine genera in the subfamily Lycopodioideae, and has from nine to 15 species. In other classifications, the genus is equivalent to the whole of the subfamily, since it includes all of the other genera. More than 40 species are accepted.

## Care Guide
This clubmoss thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light, emulating its native cloud forest habitat. Maintain consistently moist soil while ensuring superb drainage, and provide high ambient humidity. Fertilize very sparingly with a diluted solution.

### Fertilizer
Very minimal; use a highly diluted (1/4 to 1/8 strength) balanced liquid fertilizer once every 1-2 months during the active growing season. Its epiphytic/lithophytic nature means it is not a heavy feeder.
