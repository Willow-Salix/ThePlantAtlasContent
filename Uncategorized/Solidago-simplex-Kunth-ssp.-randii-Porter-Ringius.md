Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia.

## Care Guide
Rand's goldenrod is a resilient plant best suited for full sun to partial shade, thriving in average to poor, well-drained soils. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization to mimic its natural conditions.
