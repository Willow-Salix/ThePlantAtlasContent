| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Wetlands and Aquatic Environments |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, ideally receiving at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open wetland habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently wet to saturated soil, typical of its native wetland habitat. It can tolerate or even thrive in shallow standing water; never allow the soil to dry out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, consistently wet to aquatic environments, mimicking its native tropical and subtropical wetland habitats. Provide full sun and ensure the soil remains saturated or the plant is situated in shallow standing water. Fertilize moderately during its active growth period to support its vigorous nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, all-purpose or aquatic fertilizer during its active growing season to support its vigorous growth in nutrient-rich wetland conditions.
