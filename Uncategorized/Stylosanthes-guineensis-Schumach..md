| **Native Origin** | West Africa, particularly the Guinea Savanna region (e.g., Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Senegal) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open grassland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture during its active growing season, tolerating moderate dry spells characteristic of savanna dry periods. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Stylosanthes is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae and contains numerous highly important pasture and forage species. It was recently assigned to the informal monophyletic Pterocarpus clade of the Dalbergieae. The common name pencilflower is sometimes used for plants in this genus.

## Care Guide
Guinea Stylo thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native tropical savanna environment. It needs regular watering during its active growth but is drought-tolerant once established. Minimal fertilization is generally required, though phosphorus can enhance its vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Supplementation with phosphorus and potassium can be beneficial, especially in nutrient-poor soils common in some savanna areas.
