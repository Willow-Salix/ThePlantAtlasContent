## Introduction
Croton is an extensive plant genus in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. The plants of this genus were described and introduced to Europeans by Georg Eberhard Rumphius.  The common names for this genus are rushfoil and croton, but the latter also refers to Codiaeum variegatum. The generic name comes from the Greek κρότος (krótos), which means "tick" and refers to the shape of the seeds of certain species.

## Care Guide
Native to dry open woodlands of the southeastern U.S., Crotonopsis elliptica thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, exhibiting strong drought tolerance. It requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant suited for dry, sunny conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; adapted to poor to moderately fertile, sandy or rocky soils. Light, balanced fertilization during the growing season is sufficient if desired, but not strictly necessary.
