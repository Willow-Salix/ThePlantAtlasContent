# Hawkweed
### *Hieracium Ãgrohii Lepage*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern Canada (specifically Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest / Boreal Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Shade. As a plant often found in clearings and disturbed sites within temperate forests, it tolerates good sun exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering; keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings, mimicking natural rainfall patterns in its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hieracium (),
known by the common name hawkweed and classically as hierakion (from ancient Greek ἱέραξ, hierax 'hawk'), 
is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, and closely related to dandelion (Taraxacum), chicory (Cichorium), prickly lettuce (Lactuca) and sow thistle (Sonchus),
which are part of the tribe Cichorieae. Hawkweeds, with their 10,000+ recorded species and subspecies, do their part to make Asteraceae the second largest family of flowering plants.
Some botanists group all these species or subspecies into approximately 800 accepted species, while others prefer to accept several thousand species. Since most hawkweeds reproduce exclusively asexually by means of seeds that are genetically identical to their mother plant (apomixis or agamospermy), clones or populations that consist of genetically identical plants are formed and some botanists (especially in UK, Scandinavia and Russia) prefer to accept these clones as good species (arguing that it is impossible to know how these clones are interrelated) whereas others (mainly in Central Europe and USA) try to group them into a few hundred more broadly defined species. What is here treated as the single genus Hieracium is now treated by most European experts as two different genera, Hieracium and Pilosella, with species such as Hieracium pilosella, Hieracium floribundum and Hieracium aurantiacum referred to the latter genus. Many members of the genus Pilosella reproduce both by stolons (runners like those of strawberries) and by seeds, whereas true Hieracium species reproduce only by seeds. In Pilosella, many individual plants are capable of forming both normal sexual and asexual (apomictic) seeds, whereas individual plants of Hieracium only produce one kind of seeds. Another difference is that all species of Pilosella have leaves with smooth (entire) margins whereas most species of Hieracium have distinctly dentate to deeply cut or divided leaves.

A dry roadside dotted with small, ¾ inch red orange flowers, interspersed with very similar yellow ones, and often the white of daisies, is a good sign that you are in Hawkweed country.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hawkweed thrives in conditions reminiscent of its native Eastern Canadian clearings, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is not a heavy feeder and generally requires minimal fertilization, adapting well to varied soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native to often less fertile, disturbed soils, it does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring should suffice if soil nutrients are low.
