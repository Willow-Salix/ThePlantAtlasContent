## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Bahamas, Southern Florida, Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Lesser Antilles |

| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (at least 6-8 hours direct sun daily) is preferred, reflecting its open habitat in its native range. Can tolerate partial sun but may flower less. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during the growing season (spring through fall), allowing the top few inches of soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerant of moderate drought once established, but consistent moisture promotes better growth and flowering. Reduce watering in cooler, dormant periods. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bahama Senna thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native tropical and subtropical dry forest environment. Provide regular watering during its active growth, ensuring the soil dries slightly between sessions, and apply a balanced fertilizer moderately. This species is relatively low-maintenance and drought-tolerant once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in spring and again in mid-summer during its active growing period. As a legume, it can fix some nitrogen, so heavy nitrogen fertilization is not typically needed.
