## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-native plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, exhibiting strong drought tolerance. It adapts well to lean, well-draining soil with very infrequent fertilization, mirroring its arid scrubland origins.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low, as adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, during the active growing season with a diluted, balanced formula.
