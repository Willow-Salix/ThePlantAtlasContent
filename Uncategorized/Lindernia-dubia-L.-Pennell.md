## Introduction
The genus Lindernia is a group of plants in the family Linderniaceae. They are native to warm regions in both the Eastern and Western Hemisphere.
The genus name of Lindernia is in honour of Franz Balthasar von Lindern (1682–1755), French doctor and botanist in Strasbourg and also university botanical garden director. 
Lindernia consists of 30 species in its most recent circumscription. Some species have become available commercially for use in home aquariums and aquascaping, such as L. rotundifolia.

## Care Guide
This wetland plant thrives in consistently wet to shallowly submerged conditions under full sun to partial shade. Ensure its soil never dries out, mimicking its natural habitat in ditches and along water margins. It prefers nutrient-rich soil but is not a heavy feeder.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; thrives in nutrient-rich, mucky soil. A balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season if growth is poor.
