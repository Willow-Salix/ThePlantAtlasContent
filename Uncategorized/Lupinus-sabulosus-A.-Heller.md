## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soil, tolerating dry conditions once established. Avoid overwatering and excessive nitrogen fertilizer to ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, especially nitrogen, as lupines are legumes and fix their own nitrogen. Sandy soils in their native habitat are typically low in nutrients.
