## Introduction
Cheirodendron is a genus of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. All six species in the genus are endemic to Polynesia. The five Hawaiian species are generally called ʻōlapa, and occur in wet forests on all major islands as well as some mesic forests, such as Kipuka Puaulu.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native Hawaiian montane wet forest. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained. Moderate fertilization during active growth will support its health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release or liquid fertilizer during the growing season, similar to the nutrient cycling in tropical forest soils.
