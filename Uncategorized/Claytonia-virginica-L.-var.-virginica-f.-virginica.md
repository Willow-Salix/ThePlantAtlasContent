| **Sunlight** | Thrives with bright, indirect light in early spring before tree canopies emerge, then prefers partial to full shade as temperatures rise and tree cover develops. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil during its active growth in early spring. Allow soil to dry out completely as the plant enters dormancy in late spring/early summer. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Virginia springbeauty is a spring ephemeral that needs bright light in early spring transitioning to partial or full shade as the weather warms. Keep its soil consistently moist during its brief active growth period. Allow the plant to go dormant with drier soil during summer.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, well-draining soil with high organic matter. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can encourage vigorous growth, but is often not strictly necessary in good soil.
