# Littlelobed Lichen

*Massalongia carnosa (Dicks.) KÃ¶rb.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including montane areas of Europe (e.g., UK, Scandinavia, Central Europe) and North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Appalachians). |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Montane/Alpine |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers low to moderate, indirect light or dappled shade. Avoid direct, intense sunlight, as this can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist conditions and high ambient humidity. The substrate should be kept damp but not waterlogged. Frequent misting or placement in a humid environment is beneficial. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
The Littlelobed Lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with consistent moisture and low light, mimicking its natural habitat on damp rocks and mosses in montane regions. It requires virtually no fertilization, relying on atmospheric nutrients, and maintaining high humidity is critical for its health.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low. Lichens obtain most nutrients from air and water. Fertilization is generally unnecessary and potentially harmful; if attempted, use an extremely dilute solution very infrequently.
