## 🧤 Care Instructions
The St. Lawrence Waterhorehound thrives in consistently wet to saturated conditions, often submerged in shallow water, and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ensure the soil remains constantly moist or wet, and provide moderate nutrients for optimal growth in an aquatic or bog garden setting.
