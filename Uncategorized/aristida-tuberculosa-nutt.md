# Seaside Threeawn
### *Aristida tuberculosa Nutt.*

![Seaside Threeawn](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Aristida_purpurea_form.jpg)

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and Central United States, particularly coastal plains and interior sandhills. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Dry Sandhill and Coastal Dune Ecosystems. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring direct sunlight for most of the day due to its native open and exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low water; extremely drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its adaptation to fast-draining, sandy soils. |

## 🌱 Overview
Aristida is a very nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. Aristida is distinguished by having three awns (bristles) on each lemma of each floret. The genus includes about 300 species found worldwide, often in arid warm regions. This genus is among those colloquially called three-awns wiregrasses, speargrasses and needlegrasses. The name Aristida is derived from the Latin "arista", meaning "awn".
They are characteristic of semiarid grassland. The Wiregrass Region of North America is named for A. stricta. Other locales where this genus is an important component of the ecosystem include the Carolina Bays, the sandhills of the Carolinas, and elsewhere, Mulga scrub in Australia, and the xeric grasslands around Lake Turkana in Africa. Local increases in the abundance of wiregrasses is a good indicator of overgrazing, as livestock avoid them.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide this grass with ample sunlight and well-draining, sandy soil to replicate its native coastal and sandhill environments. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely, as it is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization.
