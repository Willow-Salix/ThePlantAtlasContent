## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida), West Indies, Mexico, Central America, and northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil). |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Grasslands, Savannas, and Open Woodlands. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. It thrives in conditions where it receives several hours of direct morning sun or filtered light throughout the day, avoiding intense midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist during the active growing season (spring through fall), allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. Reduce watering significantly during its dormancy period in winter. |

## Introduction
Bletia purpurea, common name pine-pink or sharp-petaled bletia, is a species of orchid widespread across much of Latin America and the West Indies, and also found in Florida. They are terrestrial in swamps or sometimes found growing on logs or stumps above the high tide mark.
Bletia purpurea can reach a length of 180 cm (5 feet). It has ovoid (egg-shaped) pseudobulbs up to 4 cm (1.6 inches) in diameter. Leaves are linear or narrowly elliptic, up to 100 cm (40 inches) long. Flowers are pink, purple, or occasionally white, in racemes or panicles sometimes with as many as 80 flowers. Sepals are smaller than those of B. patula, usually less than 30 mm (1.2 in) long.

## Care Guide
Pinepink orchids prefer bright, filtered light and consistently moist soil during their growing period, with a drier rest in winter. Emulate their subtropical savanna origins by providing good drainage, moderate humidity, and light fertilization to support their terrestrial growth.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season with a diluted, balanced orchid fertilizer (e.g., 20-20-20 at half strength). Reduce or cease fertilization during dormancy.
