## Care Guide
This moss thrives in environments mimicking its native humid tropical and subtropical forest floor. Provide consistent moisture, high atmospheric humidity, and low to indirect light, avoiding direct sun exposure. Fertilizer is rarely needed.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs; fertilization is rarely necessary, if at all, as mosses absorb nutrients from water and air.
