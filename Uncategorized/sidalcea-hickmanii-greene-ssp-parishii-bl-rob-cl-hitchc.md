## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern California (USA) and northern Baja California (Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun is ideal, tolerating some partial afternoon shade in very hot climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth in spring, then reduced to low or infrequent watering through summer, as it's drought-tolerant once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This California native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its Mediterranean chaparral origins. It requires moderate watering during its spring growth phase but is highly drought-tolerant once established, preferring drier conditions in summer. Fertilization needs are low, as it is adapted to leaner soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Avoid excessive fertilization.
