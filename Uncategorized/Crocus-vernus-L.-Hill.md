## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Southern European mountains (e.g., Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathians), including countries like France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, and the Balkan states. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Alpine, characterized by cold, snowy winters; wet, cool springs; and warm, drier summers. Found in subalpine meadows and woodland margins. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun in spring for optimal flowering, especially crucial before deciduous trees leaf out. Can tolerate some afternoon shade in warmer regions. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture during its active growth period from late winter through spring. Water regularly when the soil surface begins to dry. Reduce watering significantly or cease entirely once the foliage yellows and dies back for summer dormancy to prevent bulb rot. Excellent drainage is critical. |

## Introduction
Crocus vernus (spring crocus, giant crocus) is a species of flowering plant in the family Iridaceae, native to the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the Balkans. Its cultivars and those of Crocus flavus (Dutch crocus) are used as ornamental plants. The Dutch crocuses are larger than the other cultivated crocus species (e.g., Crocus chrysanthus).  Depending on the year, Crocus vernus starts flowering about the same time or up to 2 weeks after Crocus chrysanthus (snow crocus) starts flowering.  Height: 4–6 inches (10–15 cm).

## Care Guide
Dutch Crocus prefers a location with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Ensure consistent moisture during its spring growing season, then allow to dry out completely as the plant enters summer dormancy. Minimal fertilization in the fall will support robust flowering.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is generally sufficient. Incorporate compost or a balanced, slow-release bulb fertilizer (low nitrogen, higher phosphorus and potassium) in the fall, especially in poor soils. Over-fertilization, particularly with high nitrogen, can hinder flowering.
