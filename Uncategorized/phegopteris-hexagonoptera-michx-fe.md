## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Broad Beechfern thrives in conditions mirroring its native temperate deciduous forest habitat, requiring partial to full shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Ensure high humidity and provide light organic fertilization annually to support its natural growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with an organic, balanced fertilizer or compost in spring; not a heavy feeder, as forest soils are typically rich in decaying organic matter.
