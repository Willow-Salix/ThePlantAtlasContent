| **Native Origin** | Chile and Argentina (South America), found in montane and subalpine regions. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine, characterized by cool temperatures, moderate to high humidity, often growing in moist, shaded, or rocky areas near streams or forest edges. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial shade to bright indirect light. Avoid direct, intense afternoon sun, which can scorch its foliage. |

This genus consists of about 269 species of shrubs, lianas and herbs, and the geographical range extends from Patagonia to central Mexico, with its distribution centre in Andean region.

## Care Guide
This Calceolaria thrives in cool, humid environments with consistent soil moisture and superior drainage. It requires partial shade or bright indirect light and benefits from light feeding during its growth period for optimal health and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from light to moderate fertilization during its active growing season (spring and summer) using a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength. Reduce or cease fertilization during dormancy.
