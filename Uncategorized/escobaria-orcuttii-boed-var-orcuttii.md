## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its arid native habitat. Water deeply but infrequently, ensuring the soil completely dries out between applications, and significantly reduce watering in winter. Fertilize sparingly with a low-nitrogen formula during its spring and summer growing period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Apply a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer), avoiding fertilization in fall and winter.
