## 🌱 Overview
Amelanchier ( am-ə-LAN-sheer), also known as shadbush, shadwood or shadblow, serviceberry or sarvisberry (or just sarvis), juneberry, saskatoon, sugarplum, wild-plum or chuckley pear, is a genus of about 20 species of deciduous-leaved shrubs and small trees in the rose family (Rosaceae).
Amelanchier is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, growing primarily in early successional habitats. It is most diverse taxonomically in North America, especially in the northeastern United States and adjacent southeastern Canada, and at least one species is native to every U.S. state except Hawaii and to every Canadian province and territory. Four species also occur in Asia, and two in Europe. 
A pome fruit, the berries are commonly consumed by wildlife and picked by humans for uses in baked goods. The Canadian city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan is named after a Cree term for the berry.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pacific Serviceberry thrives in temperate forest and woodland conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, benefiting from regular watering and moderate fertilization or compost application in spring to support healthy growth and fruit production.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate, balanced fertilizer in early spring, or enrichment with organic compost to mimic its native forest floor environment, which typically has rich, decomposing organic matter.
