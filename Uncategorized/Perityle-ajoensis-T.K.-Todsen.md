## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Ajo Mountains, Sonoran Desert, Arizona, USA |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Sonoran Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), often thriving in exposed, rocky locations. |
| **Watering** | Very low; requires excellent drainage and prolonged dry periods between sparse, deep waterings to mimic desert rainfall patterns. Allow soil to dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Perityle is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family. They are known generally as rock daisies.
Perityle is a variable genus, with its members sharing few characteristics. They include small herbs to spreading shrubs and most bear yellow or white daisylike flower heads. The fruit is generally a flat seed with thickened margins which may or may not have a pappus or scales. Plants of this genus are native to North and South America.
A study including morphological and cytological analyses and a phylogenomic analysis of chloroplast and nuclear genomes was published in 2022, and concluded that Perityle as previously circumscribed was polyphyletic. The authors revived and/or expanded the genera Galinsogeopsis, Laphamia, and Nesothamnus to establish monophyletic clades. The small genus Amauria and the Desventuradas Islands endemic species Lycapsus tenuifolius were merged into Perityle, leaving it with 13 species.

## Care Guide
The Ajo Rockdaisy thrives in conditions mirroring its desert habitat: full sun, very well-draining soil, and minimal water. It requires infrequent deep waterings, allowing the soil to dry completely, and has very low fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky desert soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary, and if used, should be very dilute and infrequent.
