## Care Guide
This hardy native thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring consistently moist yet well-drained soil, replicating its subalpine meadow habitat. It is not a heavy feeder, benefiting from minimal fertilizer only if soil nutrients are severely lacking. Ensure good air circulation and prevent waterlogging to maintain health.

### Fertilizer
Low. A light application of a balanced fertilizer in spring if soil is poor; otherwise, generally not necessary.
