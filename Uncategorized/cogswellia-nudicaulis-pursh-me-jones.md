| **🌡️ Climate** | Dry Grasslands, Sagebrush Scrub, and open Ponderosa Pine forests; typically characterized by dry summers and wet winters (Mediterranean/semi-arid continental climate). |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun is essential, mimicking its natural habitat in open, exposed sites. It thrives with abundant direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires minimal water, especially during its summer dormancy period. Water sparingly during the active growing season (late winter to spring) and ensure excellent drainage to prevent rot. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native habitat in open, dry areas of western North America. It requires infrequent watering, especially during its summer dormancy, and has low fertilizer needs, adapting to leaner soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. It is adapted to lean soils; an annual application of a balanced, diluted fertilizer in early spring might be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary.
