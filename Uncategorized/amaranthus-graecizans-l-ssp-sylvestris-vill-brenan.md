## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Basin (Southern Europe, North Africa, Western Asia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its adaptation to open, exposed landscapes. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent to moderate, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, but benefits from occasional watering during prolonged dry spells. |

## 🌱 Overview
Amaranthus is a cosmopolitan group of more than 50 species which make up the genus of annual or short-lived perennial plants collectively known as amaranths. Some names include "prostrate pigweed" and "love lies bleeding". Some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables, pseudocereals, and ornamental plants.
Catkin-like cymes of densely packed flowers grow in summer or fall. Amaranth varies in flower, leaf, and stem color with a range of striking pigments from the spectrum of maroon to crimson and can grow longitudinally from 1 to 2.5 metres (3 to 8 feet) tall with a cylindrical, succulent, fibrous stem that is hollow with grooves and bracteoles when mature.
There are approximately 75 species in the genus, 10 of which are dioecious and native to North America, and the remaining 65 are monoecious species that are endemic to every continent (except Antarctica) from tropical lowlands to the Himalayas. Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus Celosia. Amaranth grain is collected from the genus. The leaves of some species are also eaten.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mediterranean Amaranth is a robust plant that prefers full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its native Mediterranean habitat. It is highly tolerant of drought once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization. This plant is well-suited for resilient, low-maintenance garden settings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced fertilizer might be beneficial if growth is stunted.
