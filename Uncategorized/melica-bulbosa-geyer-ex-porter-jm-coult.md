## 🧤 Care Instructions
Oniongrass thrives in full sun to partial shade, reflecting its native grassland and open woodland habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant and prefers infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out between irrigation thanks to its bulbous base for water storage. Provide minimal fertilizer, primarily during its active growth period, as it is adapted to moderately fertile soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Does not require rich soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or none if grown in reasonably fertile soil.
