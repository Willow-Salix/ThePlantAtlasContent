## Introduction
Rhododendron (; pl.: rhododendra), from Ancient Greek ῥόδον (rhódon), meaning "rose", and δένδρον (déndron), meaning "tree", is a very large genus of about 1,024 species of woody plants in the heath family (Ericaceae). They can be either evergreen or deciduous. Most species are native to eastern Asia and the Himalayan region, but smaller numbers occur elsewhere in Asia, and in North America, Europe and Australia.
It is the national flower of Nepal, the state flower of Washington and West Virginia in the United States, the state flower of Nagaland and Himachal Pradesh in India, the provincial flower of Jeju Province in South Korea, the provincial flower of Jiangxi in China and the state tree of Sikkim and Uttarakhand in India. Most species have brightly coloured flowers which bloom from late winter through to early summer.
Azaleas make up two subgenera of Rhododendron. They are distinguished from "true" rhododendrons by having only five anthers per flower.

## Care Guide
This azalea thrives in acidic, well-drained soil with consistent moisture, especially during its active growth. It prefers partial shade, receiving morning sun and protection from intense afternoon heat. Provide a light, balanced fertilizer for acid-loving plants in spring to support its vibrant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with an acid-forming fertilizer formulated for rhododendrons and azaleas, applied in spring, reflecting the moderately fertile, acidic forest soils it naturally inhabits.
