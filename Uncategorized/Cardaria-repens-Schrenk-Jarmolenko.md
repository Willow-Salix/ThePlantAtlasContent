## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central Asia (e.g., Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan) |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it originates from open, treeless steppes where it receives direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; it is highly drought-tolerant once established due to its native semi-arid environment with limited rainfall. Prefers well-drained soil to avoid root rot. |

## Care Guide
This resilient plant, native to the semi-arid steppes of Central Asia, thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering once established, and requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; plants from steppe regions are typically adapted to nutrient-poor or moderately fertile soils and do not require heavy fertilization.
