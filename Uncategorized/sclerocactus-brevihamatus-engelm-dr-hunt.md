## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Texas, Big Bend region) and Northern Mexico (Coahuila) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland; Chihuahuan Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full direct sun. Requires high light intensity to prevent etiolation and promote healthy growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely infrequent. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water deeply but rarely during the active growing season (spring/summer) and keep almost entirely dry during dormancy (fall/winter). Excellent drainage is paramount to prevent root rot. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus thrives in conditions mimicking its arid native habitat: full sun, extremely well-draining soil, and infrequent watering. Overwatering is the most common cause of failure, especially during dormancy. Provide minimal fertilizer and protection from extreme cold.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a weak, balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season. Native soils are poor.
