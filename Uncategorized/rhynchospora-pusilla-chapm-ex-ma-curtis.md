## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (wet pinelands, bogs, moist savannas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; thrives in open, bright environments typical of savannas and wet flatwoods. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist to wet; does not tolerate drying out. Can thrive in conditions with periodically standing water, mimicking its native bog and wetland habitats. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fairy Beaksedge requires consistently wet to moist soil conditions and bright light to full sun. It thrives in high humidity and with minimal fertilization, making it suitable for bog gardens or aquatic margins where its native wetland environment can be replicated.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils often found in its native wetland habitats.
