## Care Guide
Blue Elderberry thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate watering, becoming drought-tolerant once established. It is not a heavy feeder and generally benefits from minimal fertilization in average to good soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied annually in spring if soil fertility is low, otherwise it's often not needed.
