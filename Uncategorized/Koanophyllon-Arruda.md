## Introduction
Eupatorium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, containing from 36 to 60 species depending on the classification system. Most are herbaceous perennials growing to 0.5–3 m (1.6–9.8 ft) tall. A few are shrubs. The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The type species of the genus Eupatorium cannabinum, which is also the sole European species, is known as hemp-agrimony. Most in North America are commonly called boneset, thoroughwort or snakeroot. The genus is named after Mithridates VI Eupator, king of Pontus.

## Care Guide
Thoroughworts from the genus Koanophyllon thrive in conditions mimicking their native tropical and subtropical moist forest habitats. Provide them with partial sun to bright indirect light and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but not waterlogged. A moderate feeding schedule during active growth will support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding during the growing season, reflecting the nutrient cycling in forest environments.
