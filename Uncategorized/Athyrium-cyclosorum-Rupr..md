## Introduction
Athyrium (lady-fern) is a genus of about 180 species of terrestrial ferns, with a cosmopolitan distribution.  It is placed in the family Athyriaceae, in the order Polypodiales.
Its genus name is from Greek a- ('without') and Latinized Greek thyreos ('shield'), describing its inconspicuous indusium (sorus' covering).
The common name "lady fern" refers in particular to the common lady fern, Athyrium filix-femina.
Athyrium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the small angle shades and Sthenopis auratus.

## Care Guide
The Western Lady Fern thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, mimicking its native temperate forest understory. It requires consistently moist soil and high humidity, along with protection from direct sun, to maintain its lush foliage. Occasional light fertilization during its active growth period supports vigorous health.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, organic-rich fertilizer during the growing season (spring to early summer).
