## 🧤 Care Instructions
This delicate filmy fern thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest understory habitat, demanding extremely high humidity and deep shade. It requires a consistently moist environment and must never be allowed to dry out, making terrarium cultivation essential for success.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is needed. If fertilizing, use a very highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/8 to 1/10 strength) infrequently, only during active growth.
