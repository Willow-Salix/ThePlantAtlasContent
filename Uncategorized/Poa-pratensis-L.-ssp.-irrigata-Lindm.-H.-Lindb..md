## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate Eurasia |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. Requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and density, reflective of its open grassland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to high. Prefers consistently moist soil; regular watering is essential, especially during dry periods, reflecting its 'irrigata' designation and natural habitat rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## Care Guide
Spreading Bluegrass, originating from temperate grasslands, thrives in full sun and consistently moist soil, requiring moderate to high watering. Regular fertilization, focusing on nitrogen during active growth, ensures healthy, dense foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from regular applications of a balanced fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, during active growth cycles in spring and fall, to support vigorous foliage typical of rich grassland soils.
