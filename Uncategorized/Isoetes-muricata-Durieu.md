## Introduction
Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of lycopod. It is the only living genus in the family Isoetaceae and order Isoetales. As of 2016, there were about 200 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution mostly in aquatic habitats but with the individual species often scarce to rare. Species virtually identical to modern quillworts have existed since the Jurassic epoch, though the timing of the origin of modern Isoetes is subject to considerable uncertainty.
The name of the genus may also be spelled Isoëtes. The diaeresis (two dots over the e) indicates that the o and the e are to be pronounced in two distinct syllables. Including this in print is optional; either spelling (Isoetes or Isoëtes) is correct.

## Care Guide
The Muricate Quillwort is an aquatic plant best suited for cool, temperate freshwater environments. It requires continuous submersion in clean water with moderate to high light exposure. Nutrient requirements are low, naturally obtained from the aquatic habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; derives nutrients from the water column and natural aquatic substrates. Avoid excessive fertilization.
