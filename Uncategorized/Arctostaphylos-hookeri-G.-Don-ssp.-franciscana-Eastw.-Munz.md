## Introduction
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## Care Guide
Thriving in a Mediterranean climate, the Franciscan Manzanita requires full sun and excellent drainage. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering mainly during extended dry spells and generally no supplemental fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements. Adapted to nutrient-poor soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
