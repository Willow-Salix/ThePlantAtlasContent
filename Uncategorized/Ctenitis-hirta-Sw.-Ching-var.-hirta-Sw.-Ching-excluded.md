## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including the Caribbean (e.g., Greater Antilles) and parts of Central and South America. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light, mimicking the forest understory. Avoid direct sunlight which can scorch the fronds. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, allowing the top inch to dry slightly between waterings. High humidity is crucial, so regular misting or a pebble tray is beneficial. |

## Care Guide
To care for the Diamondleaf Lacefern, emulate its native tropical rainforest environment by providing consistent moisture, high humidity, and filtered, indirect light. Fertilize sparingly during the growing season and protect it from cold drafts and direct sun.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
