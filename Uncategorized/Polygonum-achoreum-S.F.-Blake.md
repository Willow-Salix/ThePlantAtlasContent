## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (primarily central and northern United States, and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie (often found in disturbed sites within this biome) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (requires at least 6 hours of direct sun daily, as it typically grows in open, exposed areas) |
| **Watering** | Moderate (tolerates some dry spells once established, prefers average moisture in well-drained soil, avoid waterlogging) |

## Introduction
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## Care Guide
Leathery Knotweed thrives in open, sunny locations with well-drained soil, reflecting its native habitat in disturbed temperate areas. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and has very low fertilizer needs. This hardy plant is quite adaptable to less-than-ideal soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low (thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization)
