## Care Guide
Serpentine Draba thrives in full sun and requires infrequent, deep watering, mimicking its arid native environment. It is uniquely adapted to low-nutrient, well-drained serpentine soils, so avoid rich fertilizers and ensure excellent drainage for successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; thrives in nutrient-poor soils
