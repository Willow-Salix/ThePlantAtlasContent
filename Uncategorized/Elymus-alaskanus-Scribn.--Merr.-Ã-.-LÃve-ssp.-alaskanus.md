## Care Guide
Alaskan Wheatgrass thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, mimicking its native subarctic and alpine environments. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and is tolerant of some drought. Minimal fertilization is needed to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; typically does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring if growth appears weak.
