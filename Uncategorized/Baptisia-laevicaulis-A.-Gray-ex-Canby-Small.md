## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in open woodlands, prairies, and clearings) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun is ideal. Requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and flowering, mimicking its open habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is needed, especially during dry spells and establishment. Once mature, it is quite drought-tolerant, so allow soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Baptisia (wild indigo, false indigo) is a genus in the legume family, Fabaceae. They are flowering herbaceous perennial plants with pea-like flowers, followed by pods, which are sometimes inflated. They are native to woodland and grassland in eastern and southern North America. The species most commonly found in cultivation is B. australis.
Baptisia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the jaguar flower moth, Schinia jaguarina.

## Care Guide
Provide full sun and well-draining soil to replicate its native open woodland and prairie environments. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, as established plants are drought-tolerant. Fertilize sparingly due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, ensuring robust growth with minimal intervention.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, often requiring minimal fertilization. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or compost, is sufficient if soils are poor.
