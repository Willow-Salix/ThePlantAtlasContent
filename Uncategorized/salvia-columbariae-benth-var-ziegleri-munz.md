## 🧤 Care Instructions
Ziegler's Sage thrives in conditions mirroring its native Southern California chaparral habitat, requiring full sun and excellent drainage. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Avoid rich soils and heavy fertilization to ensure optimal growth and health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to lean, poor soils and does not require frequent or heavy fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
