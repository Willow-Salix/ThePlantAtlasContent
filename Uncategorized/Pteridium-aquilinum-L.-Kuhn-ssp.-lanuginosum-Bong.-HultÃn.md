## Introduction
Bracken (Pteridium) is a genus of large, cosmopolitan, coarse ferns in the family Dennstaedtiaceae. Ferns (Pteridophyta) are vascular plants that undergo alternation of generations, having both large plants (sporophytes) that produce spores and small plants (gametophytes) that produce sex cells (eggs and sperm) in its life cycle. Brackens are noted for their large, highly divided leaves. They are found on all continents except Antarctica, though their typical habitat is moorland.  The genus probably has the widest distribution of any fern in the world. 
The word bracken is of Old Norse origin, related to Swedish bräken and Danish bregne, both meaning fern. In the past, the genus was commonly treated as having only one species, Pteridium aquilinum, but the recent trend is to subdivide it into about ten species.
Like other ferns, brackens do not have seeds or fruit, but reproduce by spores. The immature fronds, known as fiddleheads, are sometimes eaten, although some are thought to be carcinogenic.

## Care Guide
This adaptable fern thrives in temperate forest and open woodland environments. Provide partial to full sun and regular watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions. It is not a heavy feeder and requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization once or twice during the growing season; generally not a heavy feeder.
