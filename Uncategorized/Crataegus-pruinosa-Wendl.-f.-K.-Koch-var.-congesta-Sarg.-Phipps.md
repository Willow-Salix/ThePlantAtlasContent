## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (specifically northeastern United States and southeastern Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. As it naturally occurs in forest edges, open woodlands, and fields, it thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily but can tolerate some afternoon shade. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Native to regions with regular rainfall, it prefers consistently moist but well-draining soil. Water regularly, especially when young or during prolonged dry spells, allowing the top soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
The Frosted Hawthorn thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate climate, preferring full sun to partial shade and moderate, consistent watering. It is adaptable to various soil types and requires low to moderate fertilization. Providing ample sunlight and steady moisture will ensure robust growth and health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Grows in various soil types in its native habitat. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can benefit growth, especially in poor soils, but it is not a heavy feeder.
