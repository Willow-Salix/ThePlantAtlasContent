## 🧤 Care Instructions
Parmotrema lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical and subtropical moist forest habitat, requiring high humidity, consistent moisture, and filtered light. Avoid direct sun and traditional fertilizers, as it obtains nutrients from air and rainfall.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere (dust, gases) and precipitation; chemical fertilizers are detrimental.
