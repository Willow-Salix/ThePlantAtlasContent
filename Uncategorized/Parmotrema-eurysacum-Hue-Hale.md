## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions across South America, Africa, and Asia (e.g., Brazil, India, Kenya) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade; requires filtered or indirect light, avoiding harsh direct sun as it typically grows under canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and consistent moisture are crucial. It absorbs water directly from the air and rainfall, so regular misting or exposure to very high atmospheric moisture is essential. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Parmotrema lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical and subtropical moist forest habitat, requiring high humidity, consistent moisture, and filtered light. Avoid direct sun and traditional fertilizers, as it obtains nutrients from air and rainfall.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere (dust, gases) and precipitation; chemical fertilizers are detrimental.
