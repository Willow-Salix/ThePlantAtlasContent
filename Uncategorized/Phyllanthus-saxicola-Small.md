## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida), specifically Miami-Dade, Monroe, and Collier counties. |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Dry Forest (Pine Rockland) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in open, brightly lit conditions similar to its native pine rockland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Prefers well-draining soil and can tolerate periods of drought. Water moderately during active growth, allowing the topsoil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly in cooler, dormant months. |

## Introduction
Phyllanthus is the largest genus in the plant family Phyllanthaceae. Estimates of the number of species in this genus vary widely, from 750 to 1200. Phyllanthus has a remarkable diversity of growth forms including annual and perennial herbs, shrubs, climbers, floating aquatics, and pachycaulous succulents. Some have flattened leaflike stems called cladodes. It has a wide variety of floral morphologies and chromosome numbers and has one of the widest range of pollen types of any seed plant genus.
Despite their variety, almost all Phyllanthus species express a specific type of growth called "phyllanthoid branching" in which the vertical stems bear deciduous, floriferous (flower-bearing), plagiotropic (horizontal or oblique) stems. The leaves on the main (vertical) axes are reduced to scales called "cataphylls", while leaves on the other axes develop normally.  Phyllanthus is distributed in all tropical and subtropical regions on Earth.
Phyllanthus was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, but the type was not designated.

## Care Guide
Phyllanthus saxicola thrives in bright light and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native pine rockland habitat. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between waterings, and provide minimal fertilization. It is sensitive to frost and waterlogging, making good drainage paramount.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. If desired, use a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly once or twice during the active growing season. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
