## Care Guide
This fleabane thrives in conditions mimicking its Rocky Mountain origins. Provide full sun to partial shade and moderate, consistent watering in well-drained soil. It requires minimal fertilizer, preferring leaner conditions for robust growth and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to lean, rocky soils. Over-fertilization is not recommended and can lead to leggy growth.
