## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and central North America (from Ontario and Quebec south to Florida, west to Wisconsin, Missouri, and Mississippi) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest and Moist Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it grows in open woods, along stream banks, and in meadows, indicating it can tolerate full sun with adequate moisture but appreciates some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil. Its native environment of moist woods and stream banks suggests a need for regular, ample watering, especially during dry periods. The soil should never be allowed to dry out completely but should also be well-drained to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Wild Sweet William thrives in temperate conditions, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, rich soil. Regular watering is crucial, particularly during dry spells, to mimic its native stream-side and meadow habitats. Provide moderate fertility through organic matter or a balanced fertilizer to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to rich soil fertility. Native soils in these forest and meadow environments often contain abundant organic matter. Benefits from rich, well-draining soil amended with compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring.
