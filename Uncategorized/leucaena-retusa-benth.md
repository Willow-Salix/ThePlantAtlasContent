## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Texas (USA) and northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland (e.g., Chihuahuan Desert) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its exposure in open, dry native habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established; water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings. Mimics the low and sporadic rainfall of its native regions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Leucaena is a genus of flowering plants in the mimosoid clade of the subfamily Caesalpinioideae of the family Fabaceae. It contains about 24 species of trees and shrubs, which are commonly known as leadtrees. They are native to the Americas, ranging from Texas in the United States south to Peru. The generic name is derived from the Greek word λευκός (leukos), meaning "white", referring to the flowers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient tree thrives in full sun and dry conditions, mirroring its origins in arid and semi-arid scrublands. Provide infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization due to its natural nitrogen-fixing ability. It requires minimal care once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. If grown in very poor soil, a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring.
