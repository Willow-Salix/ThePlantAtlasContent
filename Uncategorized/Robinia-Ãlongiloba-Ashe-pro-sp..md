## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (hybrid of R. pseudoacacia and R. hispida) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun is preferred, ideally receiving at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Water regularly during the establishment phase. Once mature, it is quite drought-tolerant and benefits from moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. |

## Introduction
Robinia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae, tribe Robinieae, native to North America. Commonly known as locusts, they are deciduous trees and shrubs growing 4–25 metres (13–82 ft) tall. The leaves are pinnate with 7–21 oval leaflets. The flowers are white or pink, in usually pendulous racemes. Many species have thorny shoots, and several have sticky hairs on the shoots.
The genus is named after the royal French gardeners Jean Robin and his son Vespasien Robin, who introduced the plant to Europe in 1601.
The number of species is disputed between different authorities, with as few as four recognised by some authors, while others recognise up to 10 species. Several natural hybrids are also known.
Some species of Robinia are used as food by caterpillars of Lepidoptera, including such moths as the brown-tail (Euproctis chrysorrhoea), the buff-tip (Phalera bucephala), the engrailed (Ectropis crepuscularia), the giant leopard moth (Hypercompe scribonia), the locust underwing (Euparthenos nubilis), and Gracillariidae leaf miners like Chrysaster ostensackenella, Macrosaccus robiniella and Parectopa robiniella.

## Care Guide
Hybrid Locust thrives in full sun with well-drained soil and minimal fertilization, thanks to its nitrogen-fixing ability. It requires regular watering when young but becomes quite drought-tolerant once established.

### Fertilizer
As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes its own nitrogen. Little to no supplemental fertilization is required, especially not high-nitrogen fertilizers. If needed, a balanced, low-nitrogen formula can be applied sparingly.
