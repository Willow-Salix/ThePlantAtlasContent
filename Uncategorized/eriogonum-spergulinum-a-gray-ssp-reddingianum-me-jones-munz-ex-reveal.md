## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (specifically inner North Coast Ranges, Klamath Ranges, and Sacramento Valley) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland/Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **💧 Water** | Low; drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during summer dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Redding's Spurry Buckwheat thrives in full sun and requires very little water once established, reflecting its native Mediterranean scrubland habitat. It is adapted to poor, well-draining soils and benefits from minimal fertilization. The key is to avoid overwatering and provide ample light.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; tolerates poor, well-draining soils. Fertilize minimally, if at all, with a low-nitrogen, slow-release formula in early spring if growth is exceptionally weak.
