## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Asia, particularly northern China |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its origin as an open-field crop. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; as a resilient grain, it requires consistent moisture during critical growth stages but is notably drought-tolerant once established. Allow topsoil to dry between waterings. |

## Introduction
Foxtail millet, scientific name Setaria italica (synonym Panicum italicum L.), is an annual grass grown for human food. It is the second-most widely planted species of millet and the most grown millet species in Asia. The oldest evidence of foxtail millet cultivation was found along the ancient course of the Yellow River in Cishan, China, carbon dated to be from around 8,000 years before present.
Other names for the species include dwarf setaria, foxtail bristle-grass, giant setaria, green foxtail, Italian millet, German millet, and Hungarian millet.

## Care Guide
Foxtail Millet thrives in full sun and temperate conditions, requiring moderate, consistent watering while being tolerant of drier spells once established. Provide moderate fertilization to support its growth as a productive annual grain crop.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced fertilizer during its active growing season, especially in average garden soils, mimicking agricultural practices for a food crop.
