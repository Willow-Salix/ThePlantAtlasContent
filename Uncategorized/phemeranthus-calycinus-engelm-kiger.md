## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Largeflower Fameflower thrives in bright, sunny conditions and well-draining soil, mimicking its native open prairies and rocky glades. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions. Fertilization needs are minimal, as it is accustomed to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring or diluted liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season is sufficient.
