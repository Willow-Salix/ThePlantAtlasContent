## Care Guide
The Waianae Isodendrion requires bright, indirect to partial sunlight and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It benefits from light fertilization during its growing period. Mimicking its native tropical mesic habitat with stable temperatures and humidity is key to its care.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release or diluted liquid fertilizer during the active growing season. Avoid over-fertilizing as native soils are often not exceptionally rich.
