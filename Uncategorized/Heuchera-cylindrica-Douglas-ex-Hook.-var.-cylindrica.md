## Care Guide
To care for Roundleaf Alumroot, provide well-drained soil mimicking its native rocky habitats and moderate water, especially during dry spells. It prefers partial shade, particularly in hot summer climates, but can handle full sun in cooler, higher elevation settings. Fertilize sparingly in spring for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich soil.
