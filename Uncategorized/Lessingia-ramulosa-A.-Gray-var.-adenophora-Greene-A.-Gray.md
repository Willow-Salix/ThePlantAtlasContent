## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (specifically North Coast Ranges and Central Valley) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Arid Shrubland / Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Shade. Thrives in full sun exposure typical of open slopes and grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Low to very low. As a drought-tolerant plant from a Mediterranean climate, it requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially after establishment. |

## Introduction
Lessingia is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae which are native to western North America. Several species are endemic to California.
Lessingias are generally daisy-like in appearance with white, yellow, or purple flowers, but they vary in appearance. Some lessingias are sometimes treated as members of different genera, such as Benitoa. The San Francisco lessingia, Lessingia germanorum, is an endangered species.

## Care Guide
Sonoma lessingia is a drought-tolerant annual thriving in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean climate. It requires minimal watering once established and generally does not need heavy fertilization, preferring leaner conditions. Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to lean soils common in its native habitat, it generally requires minimal or no fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
