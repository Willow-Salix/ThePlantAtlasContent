## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Moist Woodlands and Meadows) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; best flowering occurs with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight, though it can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, especially during establishment and dry periods. Mimicking its native habitat along riverbanks and moist areas, it thrives with regular watering but can tolerate brief dry spells once mature. |

## Introduction
Physostegia, the lionshearts or false dragonheads  (in reference to their similarity to Dracocephalum), is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae, native to North America (United States, Canada, northern Mexico). They are erect rhizomatous herbaceous perennials inhabiting damp, sunny places. 
They grow up to 2 m (7 ft) tall with purple or pink tubular flowers in racemes in summer.
The generic name comes from two Greek words, physa (a bladder) and stege (a covering), referring to the calyx, which becomes full of fruit when mature.
Physostegia virginiana is the most common species, and is known as "obedient plant".

## Care Guide
The Veronica-leaf Obedient Plant is a hardy North American native that flourishes in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, moderately fertile soil. Regular watering is crucial, especially during dry spells, to support its vigorous growth and prolific blooms. It is a relatively low-maintenance perennial well-suited for various garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Prefers moderately fertile, well-draining soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in early spring is sufficient, particularly in nutrient-poor soils.
