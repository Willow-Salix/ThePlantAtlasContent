## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in cool, high-altitude conditions. Provide bright, direct sunlight and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-drained, especially during its growing season. Avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-sparse alpine environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from minimal fertilization, as native soils are often nutrient-poor.
