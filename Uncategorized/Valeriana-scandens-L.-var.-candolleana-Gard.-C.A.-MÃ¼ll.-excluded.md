## Introduction
Valeriana is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae, members of which may be commonly known as valerians. It contains many species, including the garden valerian, Valeriana officinalis. Valeriana has centers of diversity in Eurasia and South America (especially in the Andes), and is represented by native species on all continents except Antarctica. 
Some species have been introduced to parts of the world outside their native range, including Valeriana rubra in the western United States and Valeriana macrosiphon in Western Australia.

## Care Guide
This tropical vine thrives in environments mimicking its native forest habitat. Provide bright, indirect light, consistently moist but well-drained soil, and regular feeding during its active growth period to encourage vigorous climbing.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
