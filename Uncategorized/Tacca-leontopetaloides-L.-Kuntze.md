## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Africa, Southeast Asia, Northern Australia, and Pacific Islands |
| **Climate** | Tropical Coastal Regions and Savannas |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate full sun in high humidity areas but benefits from afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist during active growth, allowing the top inch to dry out between waterings. Reduce watering significantly or cease during its dormant period to prevent tuber rot. |

## Introduction
The genus Tacca, which includes the batflowers and arrowroot, consists of flowering plants in the order Dioscoreales, native to tropical regions of South America, Africa, Australia, Southeast Asia, and various Oceanic islands. In older texts, the genus was treated in its own family Taccaceae, but the 2003 APG II system incorporates it into the family Dioscoreaceae. The APG III and APG IV systems continue to include Tacca in Dioscoreaceae.

## Care Guide
This tropical plant thrives in bright indirect light to partial sun and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil during its active growth phase. Allow for a drier, dormant period with reduced watering to mimic its native seasonal conditions, ensuring excellent drainage to prevent tuber rot.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize moderately every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluting to half strength. No fertilizer needed during dormancy.
