## Care Guide
This prairie native thrives in full to partial sun with excellent drainage, mimicking its natural dry, open habitats. It is highly drought tolerant, needing infrequent watering once established, and benefits from lean to moderately fertile soil, requiring minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; prefers lean to moderately fertile soil. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is generally sufficient, or none if grown in suitable soil.
