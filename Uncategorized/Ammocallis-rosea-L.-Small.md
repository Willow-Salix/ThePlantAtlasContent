## Introduction
Catharanthus roseus, commonly known as bright eyes, Cape periwinkle, graveyard plant, Madagascar periwinkle, old maid, pink periwinkle, rose periwinkle, is a perennial species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native and endemic to Madagascar, but is grown elsewhere as an ornamental and medicinal plant, and now has a pantropical distribution. It is a source of the drugs vincristine and vinblastine, used to treat cancer. It was formerly included in the genus Vinca as Vinca rosea.
It has many vernacular names among which are arivotaombelona or rivotambelona, tonga, tongatse or trongatse, tsimatiririnina, and vonenina.

## Care Guide
This tropical plant thrives in full sun with well-draining soil, preferring consistent moisture but tolerating some drought once established. Provide moderate fertilization during its active growth to support its prolific blooming nature.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season.
