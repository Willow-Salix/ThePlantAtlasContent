## 🧤 Care Instructions
Didymodon rufus is a hardy moss that thrives in sunny, dry conditions on calcareous substrates. It requires minimal watering, allowing the growing medium to dry thoroughly between applications, and has very low nutrient demands. This makes it a low-maintenance choice for rocky gardens or containers mimicking its native, exposed habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses, including Didymodon rufus, obtain most of their required nutrients from air, rainfall, and the substrate itself. Supplemental fertilizer is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
