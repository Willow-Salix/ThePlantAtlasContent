## 🧤 Care Instructions
Desert Twinbugs thrive in conditions mimicking their native arid desert habitat, demanding full, intense sunlight. Water very infrequently, allowing the soil to completely dry out between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization as they are adapted to poor soils. This plant is highly drought-tolerant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization needed. Adapted to nutrient-poor sandy or gravelly desert soils.
