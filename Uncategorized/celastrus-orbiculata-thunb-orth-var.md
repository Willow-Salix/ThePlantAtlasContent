## 🧤 Care Instructions
Oriental Bittersweet thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting its temperate East Asian origins. It requires moderate watering and generally minimal fertilization due to its robust and adaptable nature. This plant is known for its vigor and can be invasive.
