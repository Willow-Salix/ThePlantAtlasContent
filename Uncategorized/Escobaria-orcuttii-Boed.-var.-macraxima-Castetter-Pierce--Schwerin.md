## Care Guide
As a desert native, Orcutt's Foxtail Cactus thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage. Water infrequently, letting the soil dry completely between sessions, and use a diluted cactus fertilizer sparingly during its active growth. Protect from frost and excessive moisture to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize with a low-nitrogen, balanced cactus fertilizer diluted to half strength once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer). Avoid fertilizing in fall and winter.
