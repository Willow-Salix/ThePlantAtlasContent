# Cup Lichen
### *Cladonia peziziformis (With.) J.R. Laundon*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America (eastern United States, Canada), Europe, and parts of Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forests and Heathlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Moderate to bright indirect light, mimicking open woodland or heathland conditions. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can scorch it. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture, primarily from high ambient humidity and occasional misting. Ensure good air circulation to prevent mold, and avoid prolonged waterlogging; allow to dry slightly between moistening. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations.
Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).
Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.
Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dunes, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.
Larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes continuella, feed on Cladonia species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cup lichen thrives in cool, temperate to boreal conditions with moderate to bright indirect light and high ambient humidity. It requires consistent moisture through regular misting but never waterlogging, and does not need supplemental fertilizer as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally no fertilizer required. Lichens are highly adapted to nutrient-poor environments and can be harmed by excess nutrients.
