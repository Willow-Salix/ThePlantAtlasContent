## Introduction
Physostegia, the lionshearts or false dragonheads  (in reference to their similarity to Dracocephalum), is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae, native to North America (United States, Canada, northern Mexico). They are erect rhizomatous herbaceous perennials inhabiting damp, sunny places. 
They grow up to 2 m (7 ft) tall with purple or pink tubular flowers in racemes in summer.
The generic name comes from two Greek words, physa (a bladder) and stege (a covering), referring to the calyx, which becomes full of fruit when mature.
Physostegia virginiana is the most common species, and is known as "obedient plant".

## Care Guide
Obedient Plant is a hardy perennial best grown in full sun to partial shade in temperate regions. It thrives with consistently moist, well-draining soil and typically requires only low to moderate fertilization. Providing ample water and sunlight will ensure vigorous growth and abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Grows well in average, fertile soils. An annual top-dressing of compost or a light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil nutrients are poor; it is not a heavy feeder.
