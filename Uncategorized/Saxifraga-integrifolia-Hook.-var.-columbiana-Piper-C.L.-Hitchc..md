## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |

| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically mountainous regions of British Columbia (Canada) and the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, USA). |
| **Climate** | Subalpine Meadow / Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers good light exposure in cooler mountain environments. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil, especially during the growing season. Avoid waterlogging, as good drainage is crucial. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
Columbia Saxifrage thrives in cool, moist, well-drained conditions typical of subalpine meadows. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure consistent soil moisture without waterlogging. Fertilize sparingly to support its natural growth habits.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer can be applied sparingly in early spring, or none if planted in naturally rich, organic soil.
