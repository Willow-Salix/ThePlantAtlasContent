## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Crimea (Southern Coast), Ukraine |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Forest, Woodland, and Scrub |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily); it thrives in open, exposed locations. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low; deeply water established trees when the soil is thoroughly dry, allowing for dry periods between waterings, especially in summer. It is drought-tolerant once established. |

## Introduction
A pine is any conifer in the genus Pinus () of the family Pinaceae. Pinus is the sole genus in the subfamily Pinoideae. The species are evergreen trees or shrubs with their leaves in bunches, usually of 2 to 5 needles. The seeds are carried on woody cones, with two seeds to each cone scale.
Pines are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere; they occupy large areas of taiga (boreal forest), but are found in many habitats, including the Mediterranean Basin, and dry tropical forests in southeast Asia and Central America. Some are fire-resistant or fire-dependent. 
Pine trees provide one of the most extensively used types of timber. The seeds are used to make dishes such as pesto, while retsina wine is flavoured with pine resin.

## Care Guide
Stankevich's Pine requires full sun and thrives in well-drained soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean climate with dry summers. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, as it tolerates drought well once established. Minimal fertilization is typically sufficient for its long-term health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally does not require heavy fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring can support growth but is often not strictly necessary for established trees in suitable soil.
