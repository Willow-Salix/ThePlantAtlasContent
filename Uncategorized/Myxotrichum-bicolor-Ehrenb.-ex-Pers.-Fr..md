## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Globally widespread, commonly found in temperate and subtropical regions, particularly in soil and on decaying organic matter. |
| **Climate** | While not a 'plant' biome, it thrives in terrestrial environments characterized by moderate temperatures and consistent moisture within its substrate (e.g., soil, dung, keratinous materials). |
| **Sunlight** | Not applicable; Myxotrichum bicolor is a fungus and does not perform photosynthesis. It typically thrives in dark, moist conditions within its substrate, away from direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | As a fungus, it requires consistent moisture in its substrate for mycelial growth and nutrient absorption. It does not require 'watering' in the way plants do, but its environment must maintain high humidity and substrate moisture. |

## Introduction
Myxotrichum is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Myxotrichaceae.
The species of this genus are found in Europe and Northern America.

## Care Guide
Myxotrichum bicolor is a fungus, not a plant, and therefore typical plant care requirements do not apply. It thrives in dark, moist conditions where it can decompose organic matter for nutrients, requiring no sunlight, external fertilizer, or traditional watering methods.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; Myxotrichum bicolor obtains all its nutrients through saprobic decomposition of organic matter (e.g., keratin, cellulose) within its substrate. It does not require external 'fertilizer' as plants do.
