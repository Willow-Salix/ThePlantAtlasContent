## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Camphor Daisy thrives in conditions mirroring its native arid scrubland, demanding full sun and well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant, preferring infrequent, deep watering over constant moisture. Fertilizer is generally not critical for this resilient desert plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. If grown in poor soil, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring may be beneficial; otherwise, often unnecessary.
