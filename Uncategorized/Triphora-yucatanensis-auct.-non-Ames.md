# Nodding Pogonia

*Triphora yucatanensis auct. non Ames* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida and Georgia), various Caribbean islands (e.g., Cuba, Bahamas, Jamaica), Mexico, and Central America. |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Moist Forests and Hammocks |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to deep shade. As a terrestrial orchid of the forest understory, it thrives in dappled sunlight or indirect light, requiring protection from any direct sun exposure which can cause scorching. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture. The substrate should be kept evenly moist but never waterlogged. High ambient humidity is crucial, mimicking its native habitat on humid forest floors. |

## Care Guide
This delicate terrestrial orchid requires conditions that closely replicate its native subtropical to tropical forest floor: deep shade, high humidity, and consistently moist, organic-rich soil. It is essential to ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot while maintaining stable, warm temperatures.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. In its natural environment, it obtains nutrients from decaying organic matter. A very dilute, balanced orchid-specific fertilizer can be applied sparingly during periods of active growth, or regular additions of organic compost to the substrate.
