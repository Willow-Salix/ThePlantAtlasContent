## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern Europe, Western and Central Asia (e.g., Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Continental Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun is ideal, as it originates from open steppes and forest edges with high light exposure. It can tolerate partial shade but may have reduced flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water moderately during prolonged dry spells, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Avoid consistently wet or waterlogged conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Prunus is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs from the family Rosaceae. The genus includes plums, cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots and almonds (collectively stonefruit). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, being native to the temperate regions of North America, the neotropics of South America, and temperate and tropical regions of Eurasia and Africa, There are about 340 accepted species as of March 2024.
Many members of the genus are widely cultivated for their sweet, fleshy fruit and for decorative purposes of their flowers. Prunus fruit are drupes, or stone fruits. The fleshy mesocarp surrounding the endocarp is edible while the endocarp itself forms a hard, inedible shell called the pyrena ("stone" or "pit"). This shell encloses the seed (or "kernel"), which is edible in some species (such as sweet almonds), but poisonous in many others (such as apricot kernels). Besides being eaten off the hand, most Prunus fruit  are also commonly used in processing, such as jam production, canning, drying, and the seeds for roasting.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Dwarf Russian Almond flourishes in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native steppe environment. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering. This plant is low-maintenance regarding nutrients, thriving in average to poor soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native steppe soils vary but are often not exceptionally rich; thus, this plant typically thrives in average to poor soils without heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer in early spring can be applied if growth is poor.
