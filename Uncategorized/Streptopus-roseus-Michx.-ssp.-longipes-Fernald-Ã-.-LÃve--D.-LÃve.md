## Introduction
Streptopus is a Eurasian and North American genus of flowering plants in the lily family, found primarily in colder and temperate regions. Members of the genus are often referred to as twistedstalk. It is one of the shade-loving genera of the lily family.
Streptopus spp. are perennial herbs spreading by means of underground rhizomes. They generally produce flowers only one or two at a time, these being often small and hidden beneath the leaves and white, greenish-yellow or rose in colour.
