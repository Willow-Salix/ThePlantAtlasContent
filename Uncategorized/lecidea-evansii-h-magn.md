## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lecidea evansii is a saxicolous lichen thriving in arid, exposed conditions on siliceous rocks. It requires full sun and derives all its moisture from the atmosphere and infrequent rainfall, tolerating long dry spells. No fertilizer is needed, as it naturally collects nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None; lichens acquire nutrients from the air and the substrate they grow on. Artificial fertilizers are detrimental.
