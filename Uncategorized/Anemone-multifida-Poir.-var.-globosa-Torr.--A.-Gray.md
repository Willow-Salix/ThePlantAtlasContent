## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains, Pacific Northwest, Great Basin), often at higher elevations. |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Meadows, Montane Forests, and open rocky slopes. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it thrives in open, exposed locations characteristic of mountain slopes and meadows. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Prefers well-drained soil and tolerates drier conditions once established. Allow the topsoil to dry out slightly between waterings; avoid consistently wet conditions. |

## Introduction
Anemone () is a genus of flowering plants in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae. Plants of the genus are commonly called windflowers. They are native to the temperate and subtropical regions of all regions except Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica. The genus is closely related to several other genera including Anemonoides, Anemonastrum,  Hepatica, and Pulsatilla. Some botanists include these genera within Anemone.

## Care Guide
This alpine-adapted plant requires full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, mimicking its native mountain habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and keep fertilization light, as it prefers lean conditions. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overly rich or consistently wet soils to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soil. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring may support growth, but heavy fertilization is generally not needed.
