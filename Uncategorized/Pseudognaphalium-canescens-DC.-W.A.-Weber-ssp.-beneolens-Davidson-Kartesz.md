## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (specifically California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Nevada) |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in open, exposed conditions typical of dry slopes and disturbed areas. |
| **Watering** | Low; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. This plant is highly drought-tolerant, reflecting its adaptation to dry native habitats. |

## Introduction
Pseudognaphalium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as cudweeds or rabbit tobacco (P. obtusifolium is the original species with that name). They are widespread in tropical and temperate regions of many countries.
Species have been moved between Pseudognaphalium and the related genus Gnaphalium.

## Care Guide
Wright's Cudweed thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid to semi-arid montane environment, requiring full sun to partial sun and infrequent watering. It is highly drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining, poor to average soils, with minimal need for fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Very low; naturally grows in poor to average, well-draining soils. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as rich soil can be detrimental.
