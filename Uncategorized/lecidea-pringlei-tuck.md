## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lecidea pringlei is a desert-dwelling lichen that requires high direct sunlight and extremely arid conditions. It does not need traditional watering or fertilization, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the environment. Mimic its harsh native habitat for successful 'care'.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere, dust, and rainfall.
