## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pacific Coast of North America (British Columbia, Canada; Washington, Oregon, California, USA; Baja California, Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Coastal Dune/Strand (Mediterranean and Temperate influenced) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its natural habitat on exposed beaches and dunes. |

## Care Guide
Thriving in its native coastal dune environment, this plant demands full sun and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established, and does not need rich soil or frequent fertilization.

### Fertilizer
None to very low; adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils. Rich fertilizers are generally unnecessary and could be detrimental.
