| **Climate** | Cool-temperate to boreal fens, bogs, and other wetlands, often in areas with mineral-rich water. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Avoid intense, direct afternoon sun which can dry out the moss. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to saturated conditions, mimicking its native boggy habitat. Maintain high humidity and never allow the substrate to dry out. |

## Care Guide
This wetland moss thrives in constantly wet, high-humidity environments, typical of its cool-temperate to boreal fen habitat. Provide bright indirect light and ensure the substrate remains saturated, avoiding any drying out, with minimal to no fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Fens are generally nutrient-poor environments for bryophytes; excessive fertilization can harm the moss or encourage competing growth.
