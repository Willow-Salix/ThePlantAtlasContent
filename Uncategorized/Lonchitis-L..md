## Care Guide
This tropical fern requires conditions similar to its native rainforest understory, meaning high humidity and consistently moist soil. Provide low to medium indirect light, shielding it from any direct sun, and fertilize sparingly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder; use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength monthly or bimonthly during the active growing season (spring and summer).
