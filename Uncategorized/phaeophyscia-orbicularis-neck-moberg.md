## 🌱 Overview
Phaeophyscia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. These lichens typically appear as leaf-like (foliose) growths that spread across tree bark, rocks, or other surfaces, usually in well-lit, nutrient-rich environments. Their structure consists of short or long lobes that range in colour from pale grey to dark brown, becoming dark green when wet, and they often have dark undersides with root-like attachments (rhizines). The genus is distinguished from its relatives by its unique chemical composition and reproductive features, lacking a substance called atranorin and producing ellipsoidal spores. While some species reproduce through specialised propagules called soredia or isidia, others form small cup-like fruiting bodies (apothecia) on their surface for reproduction. There are over 50 known species of Phaeophyscia worldwide.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable lichen thrives with regular atmospheric moisture and periods of dryness, preferring bright indirect light to partial shade. No fertilization is needed, as it naturally absorbs nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require fertilization; obtains necessary nutrients directly from the air and rainfall
