## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine tundra plant thrives in consistently moist to wet, nutrient-poor soil under full to partial sun exposure. It requires cold hardy conditions and does not tolerate drought or rich, warm soils, mimicking its native boggy or snowmelt environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none, as native tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor and high fertility can be detrimental.
