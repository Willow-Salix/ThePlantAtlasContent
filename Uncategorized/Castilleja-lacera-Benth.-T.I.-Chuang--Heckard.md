## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California and Baja California, North America |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Woodland and Shrubland (Chaparral) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open grassland and chaparral habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires good drainage and is sensitive to overwatering, especially in dry periods. |

## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
This hemiparasitic wildflower thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its Mediterranean native habitat. Mimic its drought-tolerant nature by watering deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions. Fertilization should be minimal, as it obtains nutrients from host plants and is sensitive to excessive nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils and is sensitive to excessive nitrogen. As a hemiparasite, it primarily obtains nutrients from host plants.
