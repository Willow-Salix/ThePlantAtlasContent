## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, western Texas) and northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland, Desert Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, tolerant of intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water sparingly, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking sporadic rainfall patterns of its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Commelina is a genus of approximately 208 species commonly called dayflowers due to the short lives of their flowers. They are less often known as widow's tears. It is by far the largest genus of its family, Commelinaceae. The Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus of the 18th century named the genus after the two Dutch botanists Jan Commelijn and his nephew Caspar, each representing one of the showy petals of Commelina communis.
The dayflowers are herbs that may be either perennial or annual. They are characterised by their zygomorphic flowers and by the involucral bracts called spathes that surround the flower stalks. These spathes are often filled with a mucilaginous liquid. Each spathe houses either one or two scorpioid cymes, with the upper cyme being either vestigial or bearing from one to several typically male flowers, and the lower cyme bearing several flowers. All members of the genus have alternate leaves.
The Asiatic dayflower (Commelina communis) is probably the best known species in the West. It is a common weed in parts of Europe and throughout eastern North America. Several species, such as Commelina benghalensis, are eaten as a leaf vegetable in Southeast Asia and Africa.

## Care Guide
Commelina crispa thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrublands, requiring full sun and very little water once established. It prefers lean, well-draining soil and will suffer from overwatering or overly rich nutrient environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs; rich soils are not necessary, and excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
