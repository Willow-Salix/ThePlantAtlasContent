## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean chaparral environment. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal water and no significant fertilization. Ensure good drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low. Established plants typically do not require fertilizer. If growth is stunted in very poor soil, a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring.
