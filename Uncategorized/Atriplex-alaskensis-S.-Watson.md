## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions of Alaska, USA and British Columbia, Canada |
| **Climate** | Coastal Salt Marsh / Subarctic Coastal |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it naturally occurs in exposed coastal areas with no significant overhead canopy. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow soil to dry out somewhat between waterings. It tolerates periods of both dampness (from rain/snowmelt) and relative drought common in well-drained coastal soils. |

## Introduction
Atriplex () is a plant genus of about 250 species, known by the common names of saltbush and orache (; also spelled orach). It belongs to the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae s.l.. 
The genus is quite variable and widely distributed. It includes many desert and seashore plants and halophytes, as well as plants of moist environments. 
The generic name originated in Latin and was applied by Pliny the Elder to the edible oraches. The name saltbush derives from the fact that the plants retain salt in their leaves; they are able to grow in areas affected by soil salination.

## Care Guide
Provide full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native exposed coastal habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and avoid heavy fertilization as it prefers lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements. It thrives in naturally lean, often saline, coastal soils.
