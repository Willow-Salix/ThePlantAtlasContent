## Introduction
Sideroxylon is a genus of trees in the family Sapotaceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753. They are collectively known as bully trees. The generic name is derived from the Greek words σιδηρος (sideros), meaning "iron", and ξύλον (xylon), meaning "wood."

## Care Guide
This tropical tree thrives in bright indirect to partial sun and requires consistently moist soil, especially during its active growth. Provide moderate fertilization during the warmer months and reduce watering in cooler periods, mimicking its native seasonal forest environment for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength monthly during the growing season (spring to early fall).
