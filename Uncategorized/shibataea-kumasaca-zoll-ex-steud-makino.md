## 🌱 Overview
Shibataea is a genus of Chinese bamboos in the grass family.
They are unique shorter bamboos with dark green leaves. This genus is more closely related to the genus Phyllostachys than other small bamboos. Excellent as tall groundcover or short hedges, they are especially suited to climates similar to the Pacific Northwest since they dislike dry climates. They not do well with alkaline or water-logged soil. They need acidic conditions to prevent leaf burn. They are sometimes called ruscus-leaved bamboo, as the shape of the leaves resembles that of the genus Ruscus. These bamboos are very resistant to bamboo mites. They are used to make canes.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This bamboo thrives in partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native woodland understory habitat. Ensure regular watering and provide a balanced fertilizer during its active growth period to support its vigorous nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high nutrient needs. Fertilize with a balanced slow-release or high-nitrogen liquid fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring to early summer).
