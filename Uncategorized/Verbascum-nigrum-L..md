## Care Guide
Black Mullein is a robust, low-maintenance plant suited for temperate climates, favoring full sun and well-drained, average to poor soil. Its natural habitat suggests it is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and no regular fertilization, making it ideal for xeriscaping or naturalized areas.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to average soils; rich soils can lead to leggy growth. No regular fertilization is typically needed.
