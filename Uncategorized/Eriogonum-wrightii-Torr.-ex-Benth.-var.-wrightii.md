## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Texas) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed desert and scrubland habitats. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant, reflecting its adaptation to low rainfall. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum wrightii is a species of wild buckwheat known by the common names bastardsage and Wright's buckwheat. It is native to the Southwestern United States, California, and northwest Mexico, where it grows in many plant communities, such as chaparral, in rocky habitats from mountains to deserts.

## Care Guide
Bastardsage thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soil, mirroring its native arid scrubland and desert habitat. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Avoid rich fertilizers, as it is adapted to low-nutrient conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; thrives in lean, well-draining soils typical of its native environment. Fertilize sparingly with a dilute, balanced fertilizer if growth seems stunted, or not at all in established plants.
