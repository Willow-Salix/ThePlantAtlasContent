## Care Guide
Pencilmark lichen thrives in highly humid, shaded environments typical of temperate and subtropical forests. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture and should be protected from direct sunlight, absorbing all necessary nutrients from the air and its substrate without the need for additional fertilization.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; lichens derive necessary nutrients from the air and precipitation, and excess nutrients can be detrimental.
