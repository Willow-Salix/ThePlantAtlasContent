## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA (specifically high elevations) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it grows on exposed rocky slopes without significant canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low; requires excellent drainage and should be allowed to dry completely between waterings. Tolerates dry conditions once established, mimicking periods of low rainfall between snowmelt. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This alpine native requires full sun and extremely well-drained, lean mineral soil, mimicking its natural rocky slopes. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid rich fertilizers to ensure its delicate health and unique form.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none; thrives in lean, mineral-rich but nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its native limestone or shale slopes. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
