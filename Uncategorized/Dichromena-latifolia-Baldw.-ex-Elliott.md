## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Coastal Plain from Maryland to Texas, and Florida), Cuba. |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to saturated soil; can tolerate and flourish in standing water (up to several inches deep). Never allow the soil to dry out. |

## Introduction
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in very wet, open conditions, mimicking its native wetland habitats. Provide full sun and ensure the soil remains consistently moist to wet, even allowing for standing water. Fertilization should be light, primarily during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced fertilizer or organic compost application in spring is sufficient, especially if grown in lean soil.
