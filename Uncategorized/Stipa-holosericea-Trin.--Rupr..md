## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East European Russia, Kazakhstan, North Caucasus, Romania, South European Russia, Ukraine |
| **Climate** | Continental Steppe (Temperate Grassland) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, as it originates from open grasslands with no canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, mirroring the dry periods common in steppe climates. |

## Introduction
Stipa is a genus of about 140 species of large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and  spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to Stipa, which have since been reclassified into new genera.
Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as Stipa brachytricha, S. arundinacea, S. splendens, S. gigantea and S. pulchra are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.
It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.

## Care Guide
Stipa holosericea, a steppe native, thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, needing minimal water once established. It prefers lean to moderately fertile soils, making it an excellent, low-maintenance choice for sunny, dry garden spots that mimic its natural habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Excessive nutrients can lead to weak, leggy growth. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring is sufficient for lean steppe soils.
