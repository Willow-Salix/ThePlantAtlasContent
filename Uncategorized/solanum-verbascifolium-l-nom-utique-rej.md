## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mexico, Central America, Caribbean, and Northern South America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Broadleaf Forests (typically found in clearings, disturbed areas, and forest edges) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, reflecting its common habitat in open disturbed areas or forest margins rather than deep shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during the growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. It can tolerate brief dry spells due to its resilience in varying tropical conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Solanum is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants, which include three food crops of high economic importance: the potato, the tomato and the eggplant (aubergine, brinjal). It is the largest genus in the nightshade family Solanaceae, comprising around 1,500 species. It also contains the so-called horse nettles (unrelated to the genus of true nettles, Urtica), as well as numerous plants cultivated for their ornamental flowers and fruit.
Solanum species show a wide range of growth habits, such as annuals and perennials, vines, subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees. Many formerly independent genera like Lycopersicon (the tomatoes) and Cyphomandra are now included in Solanum as subgenera or sections. Thus, the genus today contains roughly 1,500–2,000 species.
