## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This sedge is perfectly suited for bog gardens, pond margins, or consistently wet areas, demanding constant moisture and no dry periods. It flourishes in full sun to partial shade within cooler temperate climates, requiring minimal nutrient input.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native to natural wetland soils, it typically doesn't require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, if growth seems poor, is sufficient.
