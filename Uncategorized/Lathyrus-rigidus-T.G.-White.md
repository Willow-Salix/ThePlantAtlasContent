## Care Guide
The Stiff Pea is a hardy plant best suited for sunny, well-drained locations mimicking its native Mediterranean and semi-arid habitats. Provide moderate water during its spring growing period, allowing for dry spells in summer as it's naturally drought-tolerant. Minimal fertilization is necessary due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization.
