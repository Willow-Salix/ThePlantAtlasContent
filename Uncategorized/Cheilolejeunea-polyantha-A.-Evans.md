# Cheilolejeunea Polyantha A. Evans

*Cheilolejeunea polyantha A. Evans* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America (e.g., Brazil, Costa Rica, Panama) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate, indirect light. Avoid direct harsh sunlight, as it naturally grows under a dense forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and consistent moisture are crucial. Water frequently to keep the substrate or mounting medium consistently damp but not waterlogged, allowing for good drainage. |

## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical rainforest home. Provide high humidity, consistent moisture with excellent drainage, and very low, indirect light. Fertilize minimally with a highly diluted solution to avoid nutrient burn.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once every 2-3 months) or use a specialized bryophyte nutrient solution, as epiphytic plants absorb nutrients from rain and decaying organic matter.
