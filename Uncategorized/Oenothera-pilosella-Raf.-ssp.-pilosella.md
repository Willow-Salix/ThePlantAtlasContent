## Care Guide
Meadow Evening Primrose flourishes in full sun, reminiscent of its native open fields. It requires moderate watering to maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, though it tolerates brief dry spells. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to average soil fertility.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor soil conditions and does not require heavy fertilization; over-fertilization can reduce flowering.
