## Care Guide
California buckthorn is a resilient plant that thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly drought-tolerant once established, adapting well to summer dry periods. It prefers well-draining, average soils and generally does not require extensive fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for appropriate climates.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to lean soils, it generally does not require frequent or heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring can support growth if desired.
