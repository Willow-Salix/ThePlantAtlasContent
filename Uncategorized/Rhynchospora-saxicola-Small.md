## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Alabama) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in moist pinelands, savannas, and rocky outcrops) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers open, exposed environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil is ideal; tolerates brief dry periods but thrives with regular moisture. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Rock Beakrush thrives in full to partial sun with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native pineland and rocky outcrop environments. It requires minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor, acidic conditions. Ensure adequate drainage while maintaining consistent soil moisture.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to light fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils common in its native pineland habitats.
