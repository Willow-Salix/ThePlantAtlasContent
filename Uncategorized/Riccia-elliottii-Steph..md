## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Jamaica, West Indies |
| **Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Very low, indirect light or deep shade, mimicking the forest floor environment where it receives dappled sunlight at best. |
| **Watering** | Constantly moist substrate; high atmospheric humidity (70-90%) is crucial. Never allow the plant or its growing medium to dry out. |

## Introduction
Liverworts are a group of non-vascular land plants forming the division Marchantiophyta ( ). They may also be referred to as  hepatics. Like mosses and hornworts, they have a gametophyte-dominant life cycle, in which cells of the plant carry only a single set of genetic information. The division name was derived from the genus name Marchantia, named  after his father by French botanist Jean Marchant.
It is estimated that there are about 9000 species of liverwort. Some of the more familiar species grow as a flattened leafless thallus, but most species are leafy with a form very much like a flattened moss. Leafy species can be distinguished from the apparently similar mosses on the basis of a number of features, including their single-celled rhizoids. Leafy liverworts also differ from most (but not all) mosses in that their leaves never have a costa (present in many mosses) and may bear marginal cilia (very rare in mosses). Other differences are not universal for all mosses and liverworts, but the occurrence of leaves arranged in three ranks, the presence of deep lobes or segmented leaves, or a lack of clearly differentiated stem and leaves all point to the plant being a liverwort. Liverworts are distinguished from mosses in having unique complex oil bodies of high refractive index.
Liverworts are typically small, usually from 2 to 20 mm (0.079 to 0.787 in) wide with individual plants less than 10 cm (3.9 in) long, and are therefore often overlooked. However, certain species may cover large patches of ground, rocks, trees or any other reasonably firm substrate on which they occur. They are distributed globally in almost every available habitat, most often in humid locations although there are desert and Arctic species as well. Some species can be a nuisance in shady greenhouses or a weed in gardens.

## Care Guide
Riccia elliottii thrives in a consistently moist environment with very high humidity and extremely low, indirect light, mimicking its native tropical moist forest floor habitat. Ensure the substrate never dries out and provide minimal to no fertilizer to support its delicate growth.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to none; liverworts have minimal nutrient demands and can be harmed by excessive fertilization. If used, a highly diluted liquid bryophyte-specific fertilizer might be considered sparingly.
