## Care Guide
This iris thrives in conditions mirroring its native temperate woodland environment, preferring partial shade to full sun with protection from intense afternoon heat. Maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil and provide low to moderate fertilization, ideally with organic amendments. Ensure good drainage to prevent rot.
