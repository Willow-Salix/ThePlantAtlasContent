## 🌱 Overview
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native South American grasslands. It requires moderate watering, tolerating some drought once established, and benefits from light fertilization to promote flowering without encouraging excessive foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to lean soils. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring, or none if soil is already rich, is generally sufficient. Over-fertilization can reduce flowering.
