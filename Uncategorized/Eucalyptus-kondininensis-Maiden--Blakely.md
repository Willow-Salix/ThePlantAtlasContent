## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western Australia (Wheatbelt region) |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Mallee Woodland/Shrubland (Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring direct sunlight for most of the day (6+ hours). |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; requires moderate watering when young, especially during prolonged dry periods, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. |

## Introduction
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## Care Guide
Eucalyptus kondininensis thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once mature, reflecting its native semi-arid environment. It requires well-draining, poor soils and should be fertilized minimally, avoiding high phosphorus products. Provide moderate water to young plants, ensuring good drainage.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Avoid high phosphorus fertilizers, which can be detrimental to Australian native plants.
