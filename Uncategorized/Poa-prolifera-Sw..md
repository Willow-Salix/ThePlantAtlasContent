## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | West Indies (e.g., Jamaica, Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet and Dry (Savanna Climate) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, reflecting its typical growth in open, exposed areas of its native tropical habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to frequent watering during active growth, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, consistent with tropical wet and dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## Care Guide
Prolifera Meadow-grass thrives in conditions similar to its native tropical wet and dry climate, requiring full to partial sun exposure. It needs moderate to frequent watering during active growth, tolerating short dry periods, and benefits from regular, balanced fertilization for vigorous health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilizer needs, benefiting from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer application during its primary growing season.
