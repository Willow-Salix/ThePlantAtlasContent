## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort thrives in consistently high humidity and perpetually moist conditions, replicating its native humid forest floor environment. Provide very low light, such as deep shade or heavily filtered sunlight. Avoid strong fertilizers, as its nutrient needs are minimal and it is sensitive to chemical buildup.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required. Liverworts typically absorb sufficient nutrients from their environment; strong fertilization can be detrimental.
