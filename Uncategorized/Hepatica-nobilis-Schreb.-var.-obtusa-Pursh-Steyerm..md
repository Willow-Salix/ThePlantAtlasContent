## Care Guide
Roundlobe hepatica thrives in cool, shaded woodland conditions, requiring consistently moist, well-drained, and organically rich soil. Protect it from direct afternoon sun to mimic its native forest understory habitat. A light spring feeding with organic matter will support its growth.
