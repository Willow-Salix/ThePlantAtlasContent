## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and South America, including countries like Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and parts of the Caribbean. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers partial to full shade, thriving in the understory of dense forests. Direct, intense sunlight should be avoided as it can scorch leaves. Bright, indirect light is ideal. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, but not waterlogged, mimicking its high-rainfall native habitat. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry, and ensure good drainage. High humidity is also beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Piper, the pepper plants or pepper vines, is an economically and ecologically important genus in the family Piperaceae. The genus contains about 1,000–2,000 species of shrubs, herbs, and lianas, many of which are dominant species in their native habitat. The diversification of this taxon is of interest to understanding the evolution of plants.
The scientific name Piper and the common name "pepper" are derived from the Sanskrit term pippali, denoting the long pepper (P. longum).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical plant thrives in conditions that mimic its native rainforest understory: high humidity, consistently moist soil, and bright, indirect light. Protect it from direct sun and provide regular, but diluted, feeding during its active growth period to support healthy foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
A light to moderate feeder. Fertilize every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Reduce or cease fertilization during fall and winter.
