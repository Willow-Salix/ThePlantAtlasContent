## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Coastal Plain) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open fields, pine savannas, and disturbed areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. It thrives in conditions reflecting consistent rainfall but tolerates short dry spells typical of its native humid subtropical climate. |

## Introduction
Chamaecrista is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Members of the genus are commonly known as sensitive pea. Several species are capable of rapid plant movement. Unlike the related genera Cassia and Senna, members of Chamaecrista form root nodules.
Chamaecrista has 367 species, with a wide distribution – the Americas from Minnesota to northern Argentina, sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Iran, the Indian Subcontinent, Indochina, China, Korea, Japan, Malesia, New Guinea, and Australia.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring moderate watering to mimic its humid subtropical native environment. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to naturally less rich soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. As a native legume, it is adapted to less fertile soils and can fix its own nitrogen, so excessive fertilization is generally unnecessary and potentially harmful.
