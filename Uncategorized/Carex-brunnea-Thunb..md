## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in a consistently moist, shaded environment, mimicking its native habitat along stream banks and forest edges. Ensure the soil remains damp but well-drained, and provide partial to full shade to protect it from intense sun. Fertilize sparingly, as sedges are not heavy feeders, preferring moderately rich, organic soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is generally sufficient.
