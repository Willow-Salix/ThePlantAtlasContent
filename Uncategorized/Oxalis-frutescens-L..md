## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico, Central America, Caribbean (Antilles), and northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Venezuela) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Dry and Moist Broadleaf Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate some direct morning sun, but protect from harsh midday sun, especially in hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Water regularly during the growing season, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce frequency in cooler or dormant periods, ensuring soil doesn't become waterlogged. |

## Introduction
Oxalis ( (British English) or  (American English)) is a large genus of flowering plants in the wood-sorrel family, Oxalidaceae, comprising over 550 species. The genus occurs throughout most of the world, except for the polar areas; species diversity is particularly rich in tropical Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.
Many of the species are known as wood-sorrels (also as wood sorrels or woodsorrels) as they have an acidic taste reminiscent of the sorrel proper (Rumex acetosa), which is not closely related. Some species are called yellow sorrels or pink sorrels after the colour of their flowers instead. Other species are colloquially known as false shamrocks, and some called sourgrasses. For the genus as a whole, the term oxalises is also used.

## Care Guide
This adaptable tropical plant thrives in bright, indirect light to partial sun and requires regular watering with good drainage. Fertilize lightly during its active growth period to support its shrubby habit. Its resilient nature makes it a relatively low-maintenance species.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season, or use a slow-release granular fertilizer once per season.
