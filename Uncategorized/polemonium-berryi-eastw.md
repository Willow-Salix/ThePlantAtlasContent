## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Rocky Mountains of North America (USA), specifically Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright light due to its high-altitude native habitat, often found in open meadows and rocky slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil during the growing season. Avoid waterlogging, especially in cooler temperatures, but do not allow to dry out completely for extended periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Polemonium, commonly called Jacob's ladders or Jacob's-ladders (the name derived from the Biblical story), is a genus of between 25 and 40 species of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae, native to cool temperate to arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. One species, Polemonium micranthum, also occurs in the southern Andes in South America. Many of the species grow at high altitudes, in mountainous areas. Most of the uncertainty in the number of species relates to those in Eurasia, many of which have been synonymized with Polemonium caeruleum.
Polemonium are perennial plants (rarely annual plants) growing 10–120 cm tall with bright green leaves divided into lance-shaped leaflets. They produce blue (rarely white or pink) flowers in the spring and summer.
Some species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora polemoniella.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in cool, high-altitude conditions with full to partial sun and well-drained, consistently moist soil. Provide moderate watering during its growing season, ensuring good drainage, and use fertilizer sparingly to encourage healthy, compact growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Benefits from a light application of balanced granular fertilizer or compost in early spring, but generally thrives in lean to moderately fertile, rocky soils without excessive feeding.
