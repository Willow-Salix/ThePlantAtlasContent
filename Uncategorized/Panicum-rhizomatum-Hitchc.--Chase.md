## Care Guide
This grass thrives in full to partial sun with consistently moist to wet soil, reflecting its native wetland and savanna habitats. Provide moderate fertilization during the growing season to support its vigorous growth. Ensure it never dries out completely to mimic its natural, often wet, environment.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer) will support robust growth, particularly if planted in nutrient-poor soils.
