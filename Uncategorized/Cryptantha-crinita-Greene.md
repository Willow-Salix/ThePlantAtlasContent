## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central California (specifically the Sacramento Valley and Sierra Nevada foothills) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Arid Grassland/Chaparral) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low water needs; drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during warmer months. Benefits from winter rainfall. |

## Introduction
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant annual thrives in full sun and well-draining, poor to moderately fertile soil. Mimicking its native Mediterranean climate, provide minimal water once established and avoid over-fertilization to ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
