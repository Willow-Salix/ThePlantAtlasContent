## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (Central and Southern Coast Ranges, Western Transverse Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is essential, mirroring its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season (spring), allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established and prefers very dry conditions during summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Open Lupine requires full sun and thrives in well-draining soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean climate. Water moderately in spring and ensure excellent drainage, as it is highly drought-tolerant and prefers dry conditions during summer. Fertilization is generally unnecessary due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is needed. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it can be harmed by excessive nitrogen. If soil is very poor, a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer can be applied very sparingly.
