## Introduction
The genus Scrophularia of the family Scrophulariaceae comprises about 200 species of herbaceous flowering plants commonly known as figworts. Species of Scrophularia all share square stems, opposite leaves and open two-lipped flowers forming clusters at the end of their stems. The genus is found throughout the Northern Hemisphere.
Scrophularia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Phymatopus hectoides.
Some species in this genus are known to contain potentially useful substances, such as iridoids, and several Scrophularia species, such as the Ningpo figwort (S. ningpoensis), have been used by herbal medicine practitioners around the world. The name Scrophularia comes from scrofula, a form of tuberculosis, because several species have been used in herbal medicine for this disease.

## Care Guide
This temperate North American native thrives in consistently moist, well-drained soil and bright conditions, from full sun to partial shade. Provide regular watering to prevent the soil from drying out and offer light annual fertilization to mimic its natural habitat along stream banks and open woodlands.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization; an annual application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is generally sufficient.
