## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central Arizona, USA |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for optimal flowering and growth, adapting well to intense sun exposure. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering. |

## Introduction
Sophora is a genus of about 45 species of small trees and shrubs in the pea family Fabaceae. The species have a pantropical distribution. The generic name is derived from sophera, an Arabic name for a pea-flowered tree.
The genus formerly had a broader interpretation including many other species now treated in other genera, notably Styphnolobium (pagoda tree genus), which differs in lacking nitrogen fixing bacteria (rhizobia) on the roots, and Dermatophyllum (the mescalbeans). Styphnolobium has galactomannans as seed polysaccharide reserve, in contrast Sophora contains arabinogalactans, and Dermatophyllum amylose.
The New Zealand Sophora species are known as kowhai.
The seeds of species such as Sophora affinis and Sophora chrysophylla are reported to be poisonous.

## Care Guide
Thriving in its native arid scrubland and desert environments, Arizona Sophora requires full sun and exceptionally well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing infrequent but deep watering. Its fertilizer needs are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to lean desert soils, it generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial if growth appears weak.
