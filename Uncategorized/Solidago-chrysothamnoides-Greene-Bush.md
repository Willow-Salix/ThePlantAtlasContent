## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, parts of the Great Basin) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-Arid Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its native open, unshaded habitats. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as consistent moisture is not typical of its arid native climate. |

## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native arid and semi-arid regions. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid heavy fertilization to mimic its natural, lean growing conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is needed. Its native scrubland soils are typically lean; over-fertilization can harm the plant. A very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, if at all.
