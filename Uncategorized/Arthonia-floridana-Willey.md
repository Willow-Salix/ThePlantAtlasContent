## Care Guide
The Florida Dot Lichen requires consistently high humidity and indirect light, mimicking its native subtropical forest habitat. It absorbs moisture and atmospheric nutrients directly, rendering traditional watering and fertilization unnecessary and potentially detrimental. Focus on maintaining a humid, stable environment.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain nutrients from the atmosphere and their substrate; traditional fertilizers are harmful.
