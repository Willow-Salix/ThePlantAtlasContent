## Care Guide
This Hawaiian endemic variety thrives in dry, exposed conditions. It requires ample sunlight and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. Fertilization should be minimal, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-sparse native habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low; use a light, balanced fertilizer sparingly during the growing season if needed. Adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils.
