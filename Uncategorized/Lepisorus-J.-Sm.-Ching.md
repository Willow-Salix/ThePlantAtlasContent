## Care Guide
Lepisorus thrives in a consistently humid environment with filtered light, emulating its native forest understory or epilithic/epiphytic habitat. Ensure the growing medium remains moist but drains well, and fertilize sparingly during periods of active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder, typically deriving nutrients from decaying organic matter in its native habitat. Apply a diluted liquid fertilizer (quarter strength) once a month during the active growing season.
