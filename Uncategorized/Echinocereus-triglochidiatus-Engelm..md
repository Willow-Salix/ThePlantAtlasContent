## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Texas) and Northern Mexico (e.g., Sonora, Chihuahua) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and high-elevation desert, often in rocky areas and pinyon-juniper woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun to thrive, accustomed to intense, direct sunlight for many hours per day. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply during the active growing season (spring to late summer) only when the soil is completely dry. Keep dry during winter dormancy to prevent rot. |

## Introduction
Echinocereus is a genus of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized, cylindrical shaped cacti, comprising about 70 species native to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny, rocky places. Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible.
The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning "sea urchin", and the Latin cereus meaning "candle". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis.

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in full sun with highly infrequent watering, mimicking its arid native climate. Use a very well-draining soil mix and provide ample light to prevent etiolation. Fertilization should be minimal, if at all, during its growing period.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilizer needs; use a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus-specific fertilizer sparingly (1-2 times) during the active growing season.
