## Care Guide
Jack in the Pulpit thrives in conditions replicating its native temperate woodland floor. Provide consistent moisture, ensuring the soil never dries out, and protect it from harsh afternoon sun by planting in partial to full shade. Enrich the soil with organic matter for optimal health.
