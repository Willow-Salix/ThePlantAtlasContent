## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida, Georgia, Alabama) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and fruit production, though it can tolerate light partial shade. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to high. Requires consistently moist soil, especially during active growth and fruiting, but good drainage is essential to prevent waterlogging, mimicking natural heavy rainfall. |

## Introduction
Vitis (grapevine) is a genus of 81 accepted species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae.  The genus consists of species predominantly from the Northern Hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture.
Most cultivated Vitis varieties are wind-pollinated with hermaphroditic flowers containing both male and female reproductive structures, while wild species are dioecious. These flowers are grouped in bunches called inflorescences. In many species, such as Vitis vinifera, each successfully pollinated flower becomes a grape berry with the inflorescence turning into a cluster of grapes. While the flowers of the grapevines are usually very small, the berries are often large and brightly colored with sweet flavors that attract birds and other animals to disperse the seeds contained within the berries.
Grapevines usually only produce fruit on shoots that came from buds that were developed during the previous growing season. In viticulture, this is one of the principles behind pruning the previous year's growth (or "One year old wood") that includes shoots that have turned hard and woody during the winter (after harvest in commercial viticulture). These vines will be pruned either into a cane which will support 8 to 15 buds or to a smaller spur which holds 2 to 3 buds.

## Care Guide
The Calloose Grape thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its humid subtropical origins. Regular fertilization is crucial to support its vigorous growth and abundant fruit production. Provide adequate air circulation to prevent fungal issues common in humid environments.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Benefits from regular applications of a balanced fertilizer, especially during spring growth and early summer fruit development, to support vigorous vine growth and fruit yield.
