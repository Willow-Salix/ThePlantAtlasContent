## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate (specifically, riparian and aquatic microclimates within temperate zones) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade, tolerating some direct sun only if consistently submerged or extremely wet, as it naturally occurs in sheltered, damp stream-side environments. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high moisture; its natural habitat is on rocks in or near streams, waterfalls, or damp ground, often submerged. Water frequently to keep the substrate constantly wet or even submerged. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in environments mimicking its native riparian habitat, requiring constant moisture, high humidity, and protection from direct, intense sunlight. It is a low-maintenance plant regarding nutrient needs, preferring a stable, damp setting over rich fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. Mosses typically obtain nutrients from dissolved minerals in water or sparse substrate, so additional feeding is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
