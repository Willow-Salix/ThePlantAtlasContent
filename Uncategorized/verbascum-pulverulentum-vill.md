## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Broad-leaf Mullein thrives in full sun and well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, typical of its native European dry grasslands. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and virtually no fertilization. Avoid rich soils and overwatering to ensure its success.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. This plant prefers poor to average, well-drained soils and typically does not require regular feeding. Excess fertilizer can harm it.
