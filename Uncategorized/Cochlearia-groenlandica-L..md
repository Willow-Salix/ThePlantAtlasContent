## Introduction
Cochlearia danica, or Danish scurvygrass, is a flowering plant of the genus Cochlearia in the family Brassicaceae.
A salt-tolerant (normally) coastal plant which is now flourishing along roads and motorways in Europe, especially under the crash barriers in the central reservation. Its success has been attributed to its ability to survive the effects of salts distributed by gritters in winter and its small seeds being spread by the high speed of cars in the fast lane.
Full of vitamin C, it gets its name from sailors chewing it to avoid scurvy. The mauve flowers are 4-5mm in diameter.

## Care Guide
Danish scurvygrass prefers cool to cold temperatures, consistently moist soil, and full to partial sun exposure. Emulate its native arctic tundra by avoiding high heat and drought conditions, and by providing minimal fertilizer in well-drained soil.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization. Thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils. A very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the active growth period.
