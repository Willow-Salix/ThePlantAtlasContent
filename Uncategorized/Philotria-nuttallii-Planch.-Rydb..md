## Introduction
Elodea is a genus of eight species of aquatic plants often called the waterweeds described as a genus in 1803. Classified in the frog's-bit family (Hydrocharitaceae), Elodea is native to the Americas and is also widely used as aquarium vegetation and laboratory demonstrations of cellular activities. It lives in fresh water. An older name for this genus is Anacharis, which serves as a common name in North America.
The introduction of some species of Elodea into waterways in parts of Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and New Zealand has created a significant problem and it is now considered a noxious weed in these areas.

## Care Guide
Nuttall's Scurfpea thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring conditions similar to its native temperate grasslands. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and expect it to be drought-tolerant once established. It requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for sunny garden spots.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities
