## Care Guide
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in bright, sunny conditions and requires well-draining soil, reflecting its native dry shrubland habitat. Water thoroughly but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and provide minimal fertilization. Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
