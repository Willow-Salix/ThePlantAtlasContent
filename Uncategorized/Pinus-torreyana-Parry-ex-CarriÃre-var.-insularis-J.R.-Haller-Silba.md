## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Santa Rosa Island, Channel Islands, California, United States |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Coastal Island) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) as it grows in open, exposed coastal environments. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during long dry periods. Mimic the natural winter rainfall patterns of its native habitat. |

## Introduction
A pine is any conifer in the genus Pinus () of the family Pinaceae. Pinus is the sole genus in the subfamily Pinoideae. The species are evergreen trees or shrubs with their leaves in bunches, usually of 2 to 5 needles. The seeds are carried on woody cones, with two seeds to each cone scale.
Pines are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere; they occupy large areas of taiga (boreal forest), but are found in many habitats, including the Mediterranean Basin, and dry tropical forests in southeast Asia and Central America. Some are fire-resistant or fire-dependent. 
Pine trees provide one of the most extensively used types of timber. The seeds are used to make dishes such as pesto, while retsina wine is flavoured with pine resin.

## Care Guide
The Santa Rosa Island Torrey Pine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established due to its drought adaptation. Ensure ample air circulation and protect from overwatering. Fertilization should be light and infrequent, reflecting its native poor soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. If necessary, apply a slow-release, balanced fertilizer sparingly in early spring, primarily for young or struggling trees. Avoid high nitrogen and over-fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.
