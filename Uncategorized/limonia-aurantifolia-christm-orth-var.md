## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeast Asia (specifically the Malesian ecoregion) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Monsoon / Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and fruit production, mimicking its open-canopy exposure in tropical climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent and ample watering to maintain continuously moist but not waterlogged soil, reflecting the high rainfall of its native monsoon and rainforest environments. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
The Key lime, also known as West Indian lime, Mexican lime, or Egyptian lime (Citrus × aurantiifolia or C. aurantifolia) is a type of lime. While it is treated as a species in botanical classification, it originated as a natural hybrid between Citrus micrantha (a wild papeda) and Citrus medica (citron).
The Key lime has thinner rind and is smaller, seedier, more acidic, and more aromatic than the Persian lime (Citrus × latifolia). It is valued for its characteristic flavor. The name comes from its association with the Florida Keys, where it is best known as the flavoring ingredient in Key lime pie. The Key lime is not to be confused with bartender's lime or the Omani lime, which are slightly different. The last is classified as a distinct race, with a thicker skin and darker green color. Philippine varieties have various names, including "dayap" and "bilolo".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical fruit tree thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native Southeast Asian monsoon climate. Regular fertilization is crucial, particularly during active growth and fruiting, to support abundant fruit production. Ensure warmth and high humidity for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Heavy feeder, requires regular fertilization with a balanced, citrus-specific fertilizer, particularly during active growth, flowering, and fruiting periods, to support high fruit yield in potentially nutrient-poor tropical soils.
