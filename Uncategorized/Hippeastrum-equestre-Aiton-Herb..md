## Care Guide
This tropical bulb thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent watering and feeding during its active growth phase. Mimicking its native wet and dry seasons, reduce water and fertilizer during its dormant period to encourage reblooming.

### Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing period. Reduce or cease fertilization during dormancy.
