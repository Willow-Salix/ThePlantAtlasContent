## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Oahu, Hawaii, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Dry to Mesic Shrublands and Forests (on exposed ridges/cliffs) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers bright, direct light for several hours daily, reflecting its native exposed habitat on ridges and cliffs. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings, but do not let the plant experience prolonged drought. Its mesic native habitat suggests a need for consistent, but not excessive, moisture with good drainage. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in bright light and well-drained soil, mimicking its native exposed ridge and cliff habitats on Oahu. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and fertilize lightly during active growth to support its adaptation to mesic, nutrient-variable conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the active growing season (spring/summer). Use a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a diluted liquid feed sparingly, as native Hawaiian soils, while mineral-rich, often have limited organic matter.
