## Care Guide
Field Wheatgrass is a hardy, drought-tolerant grass that thrives in full sun conditions. It is well-adapted to Mediterranean climates characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. Once established, water sparingly and allow the soil to dry out, as it prefers average to poor soil without excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Can thrive in average to poor, well-draining soils. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring may be beneficial but is often not essential.
