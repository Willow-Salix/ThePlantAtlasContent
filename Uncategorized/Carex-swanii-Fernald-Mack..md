## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Swan's sedge thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native swamp and wet woodland habitats. It can tolerate partial shade to full sun but requires constant moisture. Fertilization needs are low to moderate, adapted to less fertile environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally does not require heavy fertilization, as it is adapted to less fertile wetland soils.
