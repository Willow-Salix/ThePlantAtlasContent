## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States and southwestern Canada, primarily in mountainous regions such as the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains |
| **Climate** | Montane Riparian / Subalpine Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open, exposed sites with good light. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native habitat along stream banks and wet meadows. Does not tolerate drought. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
Austin's Willow thrives in consistently moist to wet soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native montane riparian habitat. Ample water is crucial, especially during dry periods, to ensure healthy growth. It tolerates a range of temperatures characteristic of mountain environments.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially in poorer soils, but generally not a heavy feeder if organic matter is present.
