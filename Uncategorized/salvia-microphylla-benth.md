## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mexico (especially northern and central highlands), extending into southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Montane Scrubland and Woodlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sun daily) to partial sun, reflecting its exposure in open scrubland and woodland edges. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking sporadic rainfall in its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Salvia microphylla, synonyms including Salvia grahamii, Salvia lemmonii and Salvia neurepia, the baby sage, Graham's sage, or blackcurrant sage, is an evergreen shrub found in the wild in southeastern Arizona and the mountains of eastern, western, and southern Mexico. It is a very complex species which easily hybridizes, resulting in numerous hybrids and cultivars brought into horticulture since the 1990s. The specific epithet microphylla, from the Greek, means "small leaved". In Mexico it is called mirto de montes, or "myrtle of the mountains".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Baby Sage thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soil, mirroring its arid montane origins. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent deep watering to prevent root rot. Avoid over-fertilizing to encourage prolific blooming.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soil. Excessive fertilization can reduce flowering; a light, balanced fertilizer in early spring, if needed, is sufficient.
