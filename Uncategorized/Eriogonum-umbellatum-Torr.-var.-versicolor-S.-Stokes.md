## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the montane and subalpine regions of the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada ranges. |
| **Climate** | Montane to Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflecting its open, high-elevation native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water moderately during initial establishment, then infrequently and deeply only during prolonged dry spells. Requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
Sulphur-flower buckwheat thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native montane to subalpine environment. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and no regular fertilization to maintain its compact form and promote abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Very low; these plants thrive in lean, poor soils and generally do not require fertilization. If growth is exceptionally weak, a very dilute, low-phosphorus fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
