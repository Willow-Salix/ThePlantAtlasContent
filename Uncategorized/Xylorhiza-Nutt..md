## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |

| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the southwestern United States (e.g., California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico) and parts of northern Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires direct, intense light for at least 6-8 hours daily. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant; water very infrequently, allowing the soil to completely dry out between waterings. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. |

## Care Guide
Woodyaster thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland. Provide full, direct sun and water very sparingly, ensuring the soil is completely dry before rewatering. Fertilizer is generally not required.

### Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; typically does not require regular fertilization. A very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied once annually in early spring if growth appears stunted, but often unnecessary.
