## Care Guide
Bristly Jewelflower is an annual that thrives in full sun and well-drained, often nutrient-poor, soils typical of its native Mediterranean climate. Provide consistent moisture during its active growth in cooler months, allowing it to complete its life cycle before summer drought. Avoid heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in nutrient-poor soils, including serpentine soils. Excessive fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
