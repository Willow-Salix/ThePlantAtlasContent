## Care Guide
This alpine speedwell thrives in cool, northern climates, preferring full to partial sun exposure. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native subalpine meadows and boggy areas. Minimal fertilization is needed for this hardy plant.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may benefit growth if soil is poor, but often not necessary in naturally nutrient-rich soils.
