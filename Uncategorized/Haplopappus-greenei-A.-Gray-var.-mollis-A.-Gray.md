## Care Guide
Greene's Goldenbush 'Mollis' thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland and montane chaparral. Provide ample direct sunlight, infrequent watering (allowing soil to dry out completely), and well-draining, lean soil to ensure healthy growth and robust flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to lean soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. An annual light feeding in spring with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer is sufficient if growth appears weak.
