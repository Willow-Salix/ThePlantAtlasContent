## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Canary Islands (Spain) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical (Macaronesian Laurel Forest) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to full sun. While it can tolerate full sun, it may benefit from some afternoon shade in very hot climates, reflecting its origin in woodland edges and clearings. |
| **Watering** | Regular, consistent moisture, especially during dry periods. Its native laurel forest environment is characterized by high humidity and frequent mists or rainfall, indicating a need for reliably moist but well-drained soil. |

## Introduction
Viburnum is a genus of about 150–175 species of flowering plants in the moschatel family, Adoxaceae or its alternative name Viburnaceae. Its current classification is based on molecular phylogeny. It was previously included in the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae.
The member species are evergreen or deciduous shrubs or (in a few cases) small trees native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species extending into tropical montane regions in South America and southeast Asia. In Africa, the genus is confined to the Atlas Mountains.

## Care Guide
This Viburnum thrives in subtropical conditions with partial to full sun and a preference for consistent soil moisture, mirroring its Canary Island laurel forest origins. Provide well-drained, fertile soil and moderate fertilization during active growth to support its development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, balanced fertilizer applied during the growing season. Native forest soils are typically rich in organic matter, suggesting a need for a fertile medium.
