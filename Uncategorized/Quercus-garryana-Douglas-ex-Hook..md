| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, from southwestern British Columbia (Canada) south through western Washington and Oregon to central California (USA). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland/Savanna (Mediterranean climate characteristics) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth; can tolerate light partial shade, especially when young. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its native dry summers. Young trees require regular, deep watering, particularly during dry periods, to ensure proper establishment. |

## Introduction
Quercus garryana is an oak tree species found most commonly in the Pacific Northwest, with a range stretching from southern California to southwestern British Columbia. It is commonly known as the Garry oak, Oregon white oak or Oregon oak. It is named for Nicholas Garry, deputy governor of the Hudson's Bay Company.

## Care Guide
The Oregon White Oak thrives in full sun and is remarkably drought-tolerant once mature, mirroring its native Mediterranean climate. Young trees need consistent watering to establish a strong root system, but mature trees are low-maintenance, requiring minimal supplemental water or fertilizer in well-drained soil.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; established trees generally do not require fertilization. Young trees in nutrient-poor soils may benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer to aid in establishment.
