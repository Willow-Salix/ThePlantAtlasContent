## Introduction
Gentiana () is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the gentian family (Gentianaceae), the tribe Gentianeae, and the monophyletic subtribe Gentianinae. With over 300 species, it is considered a large genus. Gentians are notable for their mostly large trumpet-shaped flowers, which are often of an intense blue hue, though some are also bright yellow. The type species of the genus is Gentiana lutea.
The genus name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king who may have discovered tonic properties in gentians.

## Care Guide
To care for the Rocky Mountain Fringed Gentian, provide full to partial sun and maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native high-altitude meadow habitat. Avoid extreme drought or overly rich, heavy soils to ensure healthy growth and vibrant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native alpine soils are often lean. A light, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly once at the start of the growing season may be sufficient, or none if soil is moderately fertile.
