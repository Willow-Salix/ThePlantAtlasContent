## 🌱 Overview
Calophyllum inophyllum is a large evergreen plant, commonly called tamanu, oil-nut, mastwood, beach calophyllum or beautyleaf. It is native to the Old World Tropics, from Africa through Asia to Australia and Polynesia. Due to its importance as a source of timber for the traditional shipbuilding of large outrigger ships, it has been spread in prehistoric times by the migrations of the Austronesian peoples to the islands of Oceania and Madagascar, along with other members of the genus Calophyllum. It has since been naturalized in regions of the East African coast. It is also a source of the culturally important tamanu oil.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical tree flourishes in bright light and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native coastal habitat. Ensure consistent moisture, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings, and provide moderate fertilization during active growth for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer). Less frequent for established trees.
