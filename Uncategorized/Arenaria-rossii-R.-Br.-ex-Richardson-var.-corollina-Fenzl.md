# Ross's Sandwort

*Arenaria rossii R. Br. ex Richardson var. corollina Fenzl* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Greenland) and high-elevation alpine areas of the Western United States (e.g., Rocky Mountains). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (at least 6-8 hours direct sunlight daily). It thrives in exposed, high-light environments with no canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Prefers very well-drained soil and is highly intolerant of waterlogging. Allow the soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings, mimicking its native rocky, scree habitats where moisture can be transient. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires exceptionally well-drained soil, replicating its native alpine and arctic tundra conditions. It has low watering needs, preferring the soil to dry out between applications, and requires minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low. Native soils are typically lean and nutrient-poor. Fertilize sparingly with a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once a year, or not at all, especially if grown in appropriate lean, mineral-rich soil.
