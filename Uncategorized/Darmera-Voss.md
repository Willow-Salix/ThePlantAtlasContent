## Care Guide
The Umbrella Plant thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, mimicking its native stream-side habitats. It prefers partial to full shade, especially in warmer climates, where its large leaves can scorch in intense sun. Provide rich, organic soil and ensure regular watering to maintain vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, organic soil. Apply a balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost annually in spring.
