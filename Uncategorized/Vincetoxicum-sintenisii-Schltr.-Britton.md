## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |

| **Native Origin** | Cyprus, East Aegean Islands |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring several hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive. |
| **Watering** | Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring more water during its cooler, active growing season and less during hot, dry periods. |

## Introduction
Vincetoxicum is a genus of plants in the family Apocynaceae. Although the species in Vincetoxicum have sometimes been included in Cynanchum, chemical and molecular evidence shows that Vincetoxicum is more closely related to Tylophora, now included in Vincetoxicum. The generic name means "poison-beater" in Botanical Latin because of the plants' supposed antidotal effects against snakebite.

## Care Guide
This plant flourishes in conditions similar to its Mediterranean native habitat, preferring abundant sunlight and well-drained soil. It exhibits good drought tolerance once mature, needing deep but infrequent watering. Fertilization is typically minimal, best applied lightly during its active growth phase.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be beneficial in spring, but established plants generally require minimal supplemental feeding.
