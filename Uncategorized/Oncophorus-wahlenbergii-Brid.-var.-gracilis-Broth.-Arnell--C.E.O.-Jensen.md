# Wahlenberg's Swan-neck Moss

*Oncophorus wahlenbergii Brid. var. gracilis (Broth.) Arnell & C.E.O. Jensen* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Hemisphere, including arctic-alpine regions of North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska), Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Alps), and Asia (e.g., Siberia). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Boreal Forest (cool, moist, shaded microhabitats). |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. Protect from direct, intense sunlight, which can quickly dry out and damage the moss. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture; the substrate should remain constantly damp but not waterlogged. High ambient humidity is crucial, often requiring frequent misting or placement in a terrarium. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine moss thrives in cool, highly humid environments with consistent moisture and low to moderate indirect light. Ensure the substrate never dries out but also avoids waterlogging. Fertilization needs are extremely minimal, if any.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs; if growth appears to decline, a very dilute, specialized moss fertilizer can be used sparingly.
