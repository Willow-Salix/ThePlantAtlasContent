## 🧤 Care Instructions
Seashore Centipede Grass is best grown in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native coastal environment. It is a low-maintenance grass requiring minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to sandy, less fertile conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs, as it is adapted to the often nutrient-poor sandy soils of coastal environments.
