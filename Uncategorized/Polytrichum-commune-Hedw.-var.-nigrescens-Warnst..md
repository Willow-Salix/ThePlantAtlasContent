## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere (North America, Europe, Asia), and extending to parts of the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Australia, New Zealand). |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forests, Bogs, and Moist Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can dry out the moss rapidly. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist; moss requires high humidity and frequent watering or misting to prevent drying out. Ensure good drainage while maintaining moisture. |

## Introduction
Polytrichum is a genus of mosses — commonly called haircap moss or hair moss — which contains approximately 70 species that have a cosmopolitan distribution.
The genus Polytrichum has a number of closely related sporophytic characters. The scientific name is derived from the Ancient Greek words polys, meaning "many", and thrix, meaning "hair". This name was used in ancient times to refer to plants with fine, hairlike parts, including mosses, but this application specifically refers to the hairy calyptras found on young sporophytes. A similar naming related to hair appears in Old Norse, haddr silfjar, "hair of Sif", goddess from Norse Mythology, wife of the god Thor. There are two major sections of Polytrichum species. The first — section Polytrichum — has narrow, toothed, and relatively erect leaf margins. The other — section Juniperifolia — has broad, entire,  and sharply inflexed leaf margins that enclose the lamellae on the upper leaf surface.

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in environments mimicking its native temperate and boreal woodlands or bogs, requiring consistent moisture, high humidity, and ample shade. Avoid direct sun and excessive nutrients to ensure healthy growth, keeping its substrate consistently damp.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. Mosses thrive in nutrient-poor conditions; over-fertilization can be detrimental.
