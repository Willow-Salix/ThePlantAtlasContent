## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Maui, Hawaii, USA |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Montane Dry Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; requires bright light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings; prefers infrequent, deep watering over constant moisture to mimic dry spells. |

## Introduction
Schiedea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It contains 35 species which are endemic to Hawaii.
The 35th species was spotted in 2016 by Tom DeMent while surveying a forest near Laupāhoehoe on Hawai‘i Island. It was named S. haakoaensis in 2022.

## Care Guide
The Hairy Schiedea thrives in bright, sunny conditions and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Hawaiian montane dry shrubland habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing due to its adaptation to nutrient-scarce environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; native to nutrient-poor volcanic soils, so minimal fertilization is needed, if any, during the growing season.
