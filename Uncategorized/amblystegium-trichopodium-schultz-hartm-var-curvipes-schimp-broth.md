## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions, replicating its natural forest floor habitat. Ensure constant high humidity and keep the substrate uniformly damp without being waterlogged, while providing only low to partial light exposure. Fertilization is generally minimal to non-existent.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; mosses are not heavy feeders. If desired, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied very infrequently, or none at all.
