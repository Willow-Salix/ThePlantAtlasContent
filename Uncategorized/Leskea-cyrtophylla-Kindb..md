## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America, including parts of Eastern Canada (e.g., Quebec, Ontario) and the Northeastern and Midwestern United States (e.g., New York, Michigan, Wisconsin). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade. As a forest floor moss, it is accustomed to filtered light and actively avoids direct sun, which can cause desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist substrate or environment, but not waterlogged. High humidity is crucial for its survival, necessitating frequent misting or cultivation in a terrarium-like setting. |

## Care Guide
Leskea cyrtophylla thrives in a cool, humid environment with consistent moisture and very low light, mirroring its native temperate forest floor habitat. Ensure high humidity through misting or enclosure and avoid any direct sun or strong fertilizers to maintain its health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. Mosses are not heavy feeders and can be harmed by excessive nutrient concentrations.
