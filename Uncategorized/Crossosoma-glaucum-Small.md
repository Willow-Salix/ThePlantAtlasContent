## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established. It is a low-maintenance plant best suited for xeriscaping or arid garden environments with little to no fertilization needed.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. If desired, use a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly during the growing season, especially in very poor soils.
