## 🌱 Overview
Simarouba glauca is a flowering tree that is native to Florida, South America, and the Caribbean. Common names include paradise-tree, dysentery-bark, and bitterwood. The tree is well suited for warm, humid, tropical regions. Its cultivation depends on rainfall distribution, water holding capacity of the soil, and sub-soil moisture. It is suited for temperature range of 10 to 40 °C (50 to 104 °F), and can grow at elevations from sea level to 1,000 m (3,300 ft). It grows 40 to 50 ft (12 to 15 m) tall and has a span of 25 to 30 ft (7.6 to 9.1 m). It bears yellow flowers and purple elongated oval fleshy fruits.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Paradisetree thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical dry forest, requiring full sun to partial shade. Water regularly during the active growing season, letting the soil dry slightly between waterings, and provide moderate fertilization in spring and summer. It tolerates some drought once mature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer).
