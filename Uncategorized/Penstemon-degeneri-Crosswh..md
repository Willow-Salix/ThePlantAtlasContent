## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (New Mexico, Arizona) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat on dry slopes. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, especially in winter. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
Degener's beardtongue is a drought-tolerant plant best suited for full sun and very well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It requires infrequent watering and minimal fertilization, mimicking its arid native environment to prevent root rot and promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in lean, well-drained soils; requires minimal to no fertilizer. If necessary, a very dilute, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
