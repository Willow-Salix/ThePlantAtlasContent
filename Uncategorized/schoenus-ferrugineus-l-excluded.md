# Rusty Bog-rush
### *Schoenus ferrugineus L. [excluded]*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Northern Europe, including mountainous regions of the Alps, and northern lowlands. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Fenland / Calcareous Mire |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, ideally receiving at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, as it grows in open mire habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist to waterlogged; it thrives in bog-like conditions and should never be allowed to dry out, mimicking its native wet fen environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Schoenus (Latin: schœnus; Ancient Greek: σχοίνος, schoinos, lit. "rush rope"; Ancient Egyptian: i͗trw, lit. "river-measure") was an ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman unit of length and area based on the knotted cords first used in Egyptian surveying.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This sedge requires consistently wet, ideally waterlogged, calcareous soil and full to partial sun exposure. Emulate its native fenland habitat by providing ample moisture and avoiding rich fertilization to ensure healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Fens are typically nutrient-poor to mesotrophic. A very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year in spring if growth seems stunted, but usually is not required in suitable substrate.
