## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North Africa, and North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers indirect light to partial shade; direct sun exposure can be damaging. Thrives in the diffuse light conditions found under a forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and regular moisture from rain or dew. Should not be allowed to dry out completely for extended periods, but also needs good air circulation to prevent fungal growth. |

## Introduction
Oakmoss (scientific name Evernia prunastri) is a species of lichen. It can be found in many mountainous temperate forests throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Oakmoss grows primarily on the trunk and branches of oak trees, but is also commonly found on the bark of other deciduous trees and conifers such as fir and pine. The thalli of oakmoss are short (3–4 cm in length) and bushy, and grow together on bark to form large clumps. Oakmoss thallus is flat and strap-like. They are also highly branched, resembling the form of antlers. The colour of oakmoss ranges from green to a greenish-white when dry, and dark olive-green to yellow-green when wet. The texture of the thalli is rough when dry and rubbery when wet. It is used extensively in modern perfumery.

## Care Guide
Oakmoss thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light, mimicking its native temperate forest habitat. It obtains moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere, requiring high humidity and regular misting rather than soil-based watering or fertilization. Ensure good air circulation and protection from direct sun.

### Fertilizer
Does not require conventional fertilization. Lichens obtain nutrients directly from the air and rainwater. Chemical fertilizers designed for vascular plants are harmful.
