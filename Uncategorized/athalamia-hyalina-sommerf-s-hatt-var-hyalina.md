This liverwort thrives in cool, highly humid environments with consistently moist substrate and low to moderate indirect light. Avoid direct sun and over-fertilizing, as it prefers minimal nutrients and high moisture levels to replicate its native alpine and arctic habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none; bryophytes generally have minimal nutrient needs, and excessive fertilizer can be harmful.
