## 🌱 Overview
Sida rhombifolia, commonly known as arrowleaf sida, is a perennial or sometimes annual plant in the Family Malvaceae, native to the Old World tropics and subtropics. Other common names include rhombus-leaved sida, Paddy's lucerne, jelly leaf, and also somewhat confusingly as Cuban jute, Queensland-hemp, and Indian hemp (although S. rhombifolia is not closely related to either jute or hemp). Synonyms include Malva rhombifolia. It is used in Ayurvedic medicine, where it is known as kurumthotti.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its origins in arid scrublands. Provide infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and keep fertilization to a minimum. It is an excellent, low-maintenance choice for hot, dry climates and xeriscaping.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Native to nutrient-poor desert soils, it requires minimal to no supplemental feeding. If desired, a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
