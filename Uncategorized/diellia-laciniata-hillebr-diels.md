# Cutleaf Island Spleenwort
### *Diellia laciniata (Hillebr.) Diels*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest / Mesic Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light; avoid direct sunlight. Thrives in deeply shaded or dappled light conditions, mimicking its forest understory habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Requires high humidity; regular misting or placement in a humid environment (e.g., terrarium, pebble tray) is beneficial. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly before rewatering. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian fern thrives in consistently moist, high-humidity environments with low to medium indirect light. Ensure good drainage while keeping the substrate damp, and provide occasional diluted fertilization during warmer months to mimic its nutrient uptake from decaying organic matter in its native forest habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder. Apply a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) once a month during the growing season (spring/summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall/winter.
