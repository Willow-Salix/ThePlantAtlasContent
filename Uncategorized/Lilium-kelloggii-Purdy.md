## 🌱 Overview
Lilium ( LIL-ee-əm) is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants growing from bulbs, all with large and often prominent flowers. Lilies are a group of flowering plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world. Most species are native to the Northern Hemisphere and their range is temperate climates and extends into the subtropics. Many other plants have "lily" in their common names, but do not belong to the same genus and are therefore not true lilies. True lilies are known to be highly toxic to cats.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Kellogg's Lily requires conditions similar to its native forest understory, favoring partial shade or dappled sun and consistently moist, well-drained, organically rich soil during its growing season. Protect from harsh direct sun and ensure adequate drainage, reducing water as the plant goes dormant in late summer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers moderate to rich, organically fertile soil. Benefit from a light application of balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer in early spring.
