## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, average to poor soils, reflecting its native habitat in temperate grasslands and open woodlands. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and fertilizer. Focus on providing ample sunlight and avoiding excessive moisture to ensure robust growth and abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Generally low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor to average soils and typically does not require regular fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in very lean soils, but is often unnecessary.
