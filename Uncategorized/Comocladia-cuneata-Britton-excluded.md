## Care Guide
Comocladia cuneata, originating from tropical moist forests, thrives in bright, indirect light or partial shade, needing protection from intense direct sun. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil, allowing the top layer to dry out slightly between waterings. Provide moderate fertilization during its active growth period to support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Incorporate organic matter into the soil to mimic native conditions.
