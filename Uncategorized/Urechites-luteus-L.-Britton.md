## Care Guide
This tropical vine thrives in full sun and requires consistent watering during its growing season, with slightly drier conditions in winter. Ensure well-draining soil and provide regular fertilization to support its vigorous growth and prolific yellow blooms. Protect from frost as it is not cold-hardy.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization during its growth and flowering periods, reflecting the naturally fertile but often well-draining soils of its native habitat. A balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks is suitable.
