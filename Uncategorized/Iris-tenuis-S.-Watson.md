## Care Guide
The Clackamas Iris thrives in partial to dappled shade within moist, humus-rich soil. It requires consistent moisture during its active growth in spring but benefits from good drainage to prevent rot. Fertilize sparingly with organic matter in spring to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
