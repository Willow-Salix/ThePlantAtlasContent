## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America, from Mexico and the Caribbean south to Argentina and Uruguay |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas, and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure for at least 6-8 hours daily, thriving in open, unshaded environments typical of its grassland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular watering during active growth, especially in dry periods, but is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Allow topsoil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Paspalum notatum, known commonly as bahiagrass, common bahia, and Pensacola bahia, is a tropical to subtropical perennial grass (family Poaceae). It is known for its prominent V-shaped inflorescence consisting of two spike-like racemes containing multiple tiny spikelets, each about 2.8–3.5 millimetres (0.11–0.14 in) long.
This grass is low-growing and creeping with stolons and stout, scaly rhizomes. The stolons are pressed firmly to the ground and root freely from the internodes, forming a dense sod. The flat, tough-textured leaves are usually hairless, with blades 2–6 millimetres (0.079–0.236 in) wide. They are flat, folded, and inrolled, tapering to a fine point. The leaf bases at the terminus of each rhizome usually have a purplish hue. The stems reach 20–75 centimetres (7.9–29.5 in) tall.
The terminal dual racemes are each attached to the top of a slender stem or with one slightly below the other. There is occasionally a third. The spikelets closely overlap in two rows. They are broad, rounded, smooth and shiny. Inside each spikelet is a tiny flower. The tiny, black, featherlike stigmas and black stamens can be seen dangling at the tips of the flowers.
Bahia grass is native to Mexico and South America, but has been naturalized elsewhere in North America and in other regions. It prefers sandy soils and is tolerant of shade. It is also fairly hardy, tolerating saline conditions and drought.
This grass is used primarily as a forage. The nutritive value remains high when mature, but it is not very productive. It is also valued as an erosion-controlling soil stabilizer, as well as for its productivity, ease of establishment, and persistence. It makes a relatively low-maintenance turf as well, with its toleration for minimal maintenance, drought tolerance, and with less disease and insect damage than some of the other warm-season grasses.
The grass uses C4 photosynthesis.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its native tropical and subtropical grasslands. Provide regular water during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings, and fertilize moderately in spring and summer for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced grass fertilizer, typically once or twice a year, reflecting the moderately fertile soils of its native range.
