## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fir Clubmoss thrives in cool, humid environments with consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its native temperate and alpine habitats. Provide indirect bright light, protect from intense sun and heat, and ensure high ambient humidity for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. It typically grows in nutrient-poor soils. If desired, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once a month) during the active growing season, or omit entirely.
