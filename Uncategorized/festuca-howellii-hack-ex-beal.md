## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (specifically California, Oregon, and Washington, USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Open Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating open exposure or light canopy cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate watering; it is drought-tolerant once established, thriving on infrequent watering and allowing the soil to dry out between applications. |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Howell's Fescue thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring low to moderate watering. It prefers well-draining soil and has minimal fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance plant suitable for naturalized landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; native grasses like this are adapted to leaner soils and do not need heavy feeding. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is optional.
