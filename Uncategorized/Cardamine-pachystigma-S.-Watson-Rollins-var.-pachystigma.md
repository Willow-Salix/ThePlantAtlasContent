## Introduction
Cardamine is a large genus of flowering plants in the mustard family, Brassicaceae, known as bittercresses and toothworts. It contains more than 200 species of annuals and perennials. Species in this genus can be found in diverse habitats worldwide, except the Antarctic.  The name Cardamine is derived from the Greek kardaminē, water cress, from kardamon, pepper grass.

## Care Guide
Serpentine Bittercress prefers full sun to partial shade and thrives in well-drained, lean soils typical of its serpentine habitat. Provide regular water during its active growth in cooler months, reducing frequency in summer, and avoid high-nutrient fertilizers as it is sensitive to rich soils.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor serpentine soils, and high nutrient levels can be detrimental.
