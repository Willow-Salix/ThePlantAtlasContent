## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South America, primarily Argentina and neighboring temperate to subtropical regions. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland and disturbed areas within subtropical zones, experiencing distinct wet and dry seasons. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun is ideal, reflecting its natural habitat in open fields and disturbed ground. It tolerates hot, direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is best, allowing the topsoil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established but benefits from consistent moisture during active growth. |

## Introduction
Erigeron bonariensis is a species in the family Asteraceae, found throughout the tropics and subtropics as a pioneer plant; its precise origin is unknown, but most likely it stems from Central America or South America. It has become naturalized in many other regions, including North America, Europe and Australia.
Common names of E. bonariensis include flax-leaf fleabane, wavy-leaf fleabane, Argentine fleabane, hairy horseweed, asthma weed and hairy fleabane.

## Care Guide
This adaptable plant thrives in full sun with moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions. It requires minimal fertilization, as it is accustomed to poor to average soil conditions in its native, often disturbed, habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a pioneer species and weed, it thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and generally does not require supplemental feeding. Over-fertilization can promote excessive leafy growth.
