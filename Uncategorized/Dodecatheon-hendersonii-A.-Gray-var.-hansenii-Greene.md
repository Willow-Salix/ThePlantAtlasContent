## Care Guide
This ephemeral perennial flourishes in bright light and consistently moist, well-drained soil during its active growth from late winter through spring. Once dormant in summer, it requires no water, mimicking its native Mediterranean habitat with wet winters and dry summers.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once in early spring during active growth, or none if planted in naturally rich soil. Emphasize well-draining soil.
