*Synechoblastus texanus (Tuck.) MÃ¼ll. Arg.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Texas, Arizona, New Mexico) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Tolerates full sun exposure on rocks and soil, but can also be found in partial shade. |
| **Watering** | Naturally absorbs moisture from infrequent rainfall, dew, and atmospheric humidity, followed by extended periods of desiccation. Does not require traditional watering. |

## Care Guide
This lichen is highly adapted to arid conditions, deriving moisture solely from environmental sources like rain and dew, and tolerating prolonged dry spells. It thrives in full to partial sun exposure without the need for conventional watering or fertilization, which can be harmful.

### Fertilizer
Requires no fertilizer; high nutrient levels can be detrimental to its growth and health.
