## Care Guide
The Cosmopolitan Bulrush thrives in full sun and consistently wet to standing water conditions, making it ideal for bog gardens or pond margins. It requires rich, organic soil and should never be allowed to dry out to mimic its native wetland habitat.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high; benefits from nutrient-rich organic soil or regular aquatic plant fertilization during the active growing season.
