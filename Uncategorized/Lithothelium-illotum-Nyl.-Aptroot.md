## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across tropical and subtropical regions globally, including South America (e.g., Brazil, Colombia), Central America, Caribbean, Africa, and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Humid Tropical to Subtropical Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light; thrives in shaded or filtered light conditions, typically found growing on tree bark beneath a dense forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and moisture from rainfall; sensitive to desiccation. Frequent misting or placement in a high-humidity environment is crucial. |

## Introduction
Lithothelium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Pyrenulaceae. Most of the species are found in tropical climates, and are usually  corticolous (bark-dwelling) or saxicolous (rock-dwelling). These lichens form thin, crust-like layers that are often embedded within their substrate and are characterized by distinctive black, flask-shaped reproductive structures that may occur individually or in fused clusters with small openings for spore release. Established as a genus in 1885 by the Swiss botanist Johannes Müller Argoviensis, Lithothelium species can be distinguished from similar lichens by their rounded spore compartments and the presence of specialized structures called ocular chambers that assist in spore discharge.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in a humid, tropical environment with low to moderate indirect light. It requires consistently high ambient humidity and regular moisture, as it absorbs water and nutrients from the air and rain. Avoid direct sun and traditional fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; as a lichen, it obtains necessary nutrients primarily from the air, rainwater, and the substrate it grows upon. Traditional soil-based fertilizers are not applicable or necessary.
