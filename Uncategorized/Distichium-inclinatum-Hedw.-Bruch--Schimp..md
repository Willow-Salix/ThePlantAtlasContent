## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal and Circumarctic regions, including northern North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska, Greenland), northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Alps), and northern Asia (e.g., Siberia) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, and cold Boreal Forest understory |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade, avoiding direct intense sunlight. It thrives in filtered light or consistently dim conditions often found in crevices or under other vegetation. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained conditions. It requires constant humidity and regular watering to prevent drying out, mimicking the dampness of its native cold, often snowmelt-fed, environments. |

## Introduction
Distichium is a genus of haplolepideous mosses (Dicranidae) in the monotypic family Distichiaceae.

## Care Guide
This moss requires a consistently moist, cool environment with high humidity and significant shade to mimic its native alpine and arctic habitats. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging while maintaining constant dampness, and avoid any direct sun or high temperatures.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses generally absorb nutrients directly from water and their substrate, and in their native, often rocky and nutrient-poor habitats, they are not heavy feeders.
