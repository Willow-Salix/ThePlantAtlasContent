## 🌱 Overview
Lolium is a genus of tufted grasses in the bluegrass subfamily (Pooideae).  It is often called ryegrass, but this term is sometimes used to refer to grasses in other genera.
They are characterized by bunch-like growth habits.  Lolium is native to Europe, Asia and northern Africa, as well as being cultivated and naturalized in Australia, the Americas, and various oceanic islands. Ryegrasses are naturally diploid, with 2n=14, and are closely related to the fescues (Festuca).
Ryegrass should not be confused with rye, which is a grain crop.
