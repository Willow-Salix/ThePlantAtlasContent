## Care Guide
This variety of Carolina Rose thrives in full sun and well-drained sandy soils, echoing its natural habitat in Eastern North American dunes and plains. It requires moderate, consistent watering until established, after which it exhibits good drought tolerance. Fertilization should be light, primarily in spring, especially in nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, especially if grown in very poor sandy soils typical of its native environment.
