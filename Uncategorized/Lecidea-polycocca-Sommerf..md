## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Boreal regions, including North America (Canada, Alaska), Europe (Scandinavia, Iceland, UK), and parts of Asia (Siberia), primarily on siliceous rocks. |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Arctic Tundra, Boreal Forest (Taiga) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect to direct light; tolerates high exposure, especially in cool, humid conditions typical of its native environment. |
| **Watering** | Relies on atmospheric moisture (rain, snowmelt, fog, dew). Requires high ambient humidity or frequent misting, with good air circulation; tolerant of periods of desiccation. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
This circumpolar lichen thrives in cool, bright conditions on siliceous rocks. Provide high atmospheric humidity through frequent misting and ensure good air circulation to mimic its native environment. No traditional fertilization is necessary, as it obtains nutrients from its surroundings.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required; obtains nutrients from atmospheric deposition and minerals in its rock substrate.
