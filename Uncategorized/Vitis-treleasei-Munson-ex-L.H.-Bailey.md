## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert (often in riparian zones or canyons) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers full sun for optimal growth and fruit production. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, but benefits from regular moisture, especially during prolonged dry periods. |

## Introduction
Vitis (grapevine) is a genus of 81 accepted species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae.  The genus consists of species predominantly from the Northern Hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture.
Most cultivated Vitis varieties are wind-pollinated with hermaphroditic flowers containing both male and female reproductive structures, while wild species are dioecious. These flowers are grouped in bunches called inflorescences. In many species, such as Vitis vinifera, each successfully pollinated flower becomes a grape berry with the inflorescence turning into a cluster of grapes. While the flowers of the grapevines are usually very small, the berries are often large and brightly colored with sweet flavors that attract birds and other animals to disperse the seeds contained within the berries.
Grapevines usually only produce fruit on shoots that came from buds that were developed during the previous growing season. In viticulture, this is one of the principles behind pruning the previous year's growth (or "One year old wood") that includes shoots that have turned hard and woody during the winter (after harvest in commercial viticulture). These vines will be pruned either into a cane which will support 8 to 15 buds or to a smaller spur which holds 2 to 3 buds.

## Care Guide
Trelease's Grape thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid canyon habitat. While it can tolerate drought, consistent moderate watering and minimal annual fertilization will promote the best health and fruit development.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied annually in early spring, or enrichment with organic compost, is generally sufficient.
