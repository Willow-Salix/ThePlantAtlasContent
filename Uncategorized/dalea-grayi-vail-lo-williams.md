## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gray's prairie clover thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, reflecting its native humid subtropical scrubland habitat. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and is drought-tolerant once established. As a legume, it needs minimal to no nitrogen fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no nitrogen fertilizer needed. Can benefit from a general-purpose, low-nitrogen fertilizer sparingly in very poor soils.
