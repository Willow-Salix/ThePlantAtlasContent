## 🧤 Care Instructions
This critically endangered Hawaiian endemic thrives in conditions replicating its native tropical mesic to wet forests. Provide indirect bright light, ensure consistently moist but well-draining soil, and maintain high humidity. Feed lightly during warmer months to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
