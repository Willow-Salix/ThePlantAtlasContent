| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | East Asia (e.g., Japan, China) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Temperate to Subtropical Forest Understory |
| **☀️ Light** | Low light to partial shade; avoid direct sunlight which can scorch the thallus. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged; high ambient humidity is crucial for survival. |

## 🌱 Overview
Hornworts are a group of non-vascular Embryophytes (land plants) constituting the division Anthocerotophyta (). The common name refers to the elongated horn-like structure, which is the sporophyte. As in mosses and liverworts, hornworts have a gametophyte-dominant life cycle, in which cells of the plant carry only a single set of genetic information; the flattened, green plant body of a hornwort is the gametophyte stage of the plant.
Hornworts may be found worldwide, though they tend to grow only in places that are damp or humid. Some species grow in large numbers as tiny weeds in the soil of gardens and cultivated fields. Large tropical and sub-tropical species of Dendroceros may be found growing on the bark of trees.
The total number of species is still uncertain. While there are more than 300 published species names, the actual number could be as low as 100–150 species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Anthoceros constans thrives in consistently moist, highly humid environments with very low to indirect light, mimicking its native forest floor habitat. Ensure constant dampness without waterlogging and provide high humidity, while avoiding direct sun and excessive fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; if absolutely necessary, use an extremely diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly.
