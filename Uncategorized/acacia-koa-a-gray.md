| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Moist to Wet Forests, Submontane to Montane |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun is ideal, as it is a canopy tree in its native habitat; tolerates partial shade but may grow slower. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture, especially when young, mimicking the high rainfall of its native habitat; once established, it can tolerate some short dry periods but prefers regular watering with good drainage. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Koa thrives in full sun and requires consistent moisture, especially during establishment, reflecting its native tropical forest environment. Ensure well-draining soil and avoid over-fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, focusing on moderate nutrient levels for healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to low fertility; as a legume (Fabaceae), it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen fertilizer is usually not needed. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be beneficial in poor soils.
