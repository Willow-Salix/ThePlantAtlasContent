## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in consistently moist, shaded environments with high humidity, typical of its native temperate boreal wetlands. Keep the substrate damp at all times and protect it from direct sun, while avoiding significant fertilization due to its minimal nutrient requirements.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Mosses have very low nutrient needs. Fertilizer is rarely necessary and can be detrimental; if used, apply a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly once or twice a year.
