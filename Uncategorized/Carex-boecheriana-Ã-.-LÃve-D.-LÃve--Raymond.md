## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This Arctic sedge thrives in consistently moist, cool conditions with bright light. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, requiring minimal fertilization. Ensure a well-drained yet constantly damp growing medium to mimic its natural tundra environment.

### Fertilizer
Low, as native tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor.
