## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and the Lesser Antilles. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Island Climate (encompassing Tropical Moist and Dry Forest) |
| **☀️ Light** | Thrives in full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and flowering. Can tolerate partial shade, but bloom production may be reduced. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers regular watering, allowing the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out completely between waterings. Mimics tropical wet/dry cycles; it is drought-tolerant once established but performs best with consistent moisture during active growth. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lantana () is a genus of about 150 species of perennial flowering plants in the verbena family, Verbenaceae. They are native to tropical regions of the Americas and Africa but exist as an introduced species in numerous areas, especially in the Australian-Pacific region, South and Northeastern part of India. The genus includes both herbaceous plants and shrubs growing to 0.5–2 m (1.6–6.6 ft) tall. Their common names are shrub verbenas or lantanas. The generic name originated in Late Latin, where it refers to the unrelated Viburnum lantana.
Lantana's aromatic flower clusters (called umbels) are a mix of red, orange, yellow, or blue and white florets. Other colors exist as new varieties are being selected. The flowers typically change color as they mature, resulting in inflorescences that are two- or three-colored.
"Wild lantanas" are plants of the unrelated genus Abronia, usually called "sand-verbenas".

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Island Lantana thrives in warm, tropical conditions, needing full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is a low-maintenance plant that benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growth period to support prolific blooming.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not a heavy feeder. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in spring, or a diluted liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season, is sufficient. Over-fertilization can reduce flowering.
