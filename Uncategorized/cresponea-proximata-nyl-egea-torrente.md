## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Macaronesia (Canary Islands, Madeira), coastal Southwestern Europe (e.g., Portugal, Spain) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Oceanic (Laurisilva forests, characterized by high atmospheric humidity, frequent fog, and moderate temperatures) |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect light to partial shade. Requires protection from direct, intense sunlight, which can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High atmospheric humidity is crucial. Requires consistent moisture, often through fog or frequent rainfall in its natural habitat. Regular misting can mimic these conditions, but avoid standing water or waterlogging. Good air circulation is also important. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cresponea is a genus of lichens in the family Opegraphaceae. The genus, circumscribed in 1993, contains species that were formerly classified in Lecanactis. Cresponea is widely distributed, but most species are found in tropical and subtropical regions. The genus is named in honor of the Spanish lichenologist Ana Crespo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in highly humid, indirect light conditions, mimicking its native laurel forest environment. Provide consistent moisture through high ambient humidity or frequent misting, ensuring good air circulation. Avoid direct sun and traditional fertilizers, as these can be harmful.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required or recommended. Lichens derive nutrients from atmospheric deposition and their substrate; high nutrient levels can be detrimental. Sensitive to air pollution.
