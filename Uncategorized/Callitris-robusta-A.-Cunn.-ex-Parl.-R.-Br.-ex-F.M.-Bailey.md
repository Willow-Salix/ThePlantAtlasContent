## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Australia (widespread across semi-arid and arid inland regions) |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Woodlands / Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially once established. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Callitris is a genus of coniferous trees in the Cupressaceae (cypress family). There are 16 recognized species in the genus, of which 13 are native to Australia and the other three (C. neocaledonica, C. sulcata and C. pancheri) native to New Caledonia. Traditionally, the most widely used common name is cypress-pine, a name shared by some species of the closely related genus Actinostrobus. Alongside Eucalyptus, Callitris is one of the dominant tree genera in Australia.

## Care Guide
This resilient conifer thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, mirroring its native Australian semi-arid habitat. It requires infrequent deep watering once established to tolerate dry periods and has minimal fertilizer needs, preferring leaner soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor soils. If needed, use a slow-release, low-phosphorus native plant fertilizer sparingly during the growing season.
