## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native flourishes in bright, indirect light to partial sun and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil to mimic its tropical forest environment. Regular, moderate fertilization during its active growth period will support its health and vigorous development.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize monthly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer.
