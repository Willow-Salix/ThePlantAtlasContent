## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Montane Wet Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to full shade, avoiding direct sunlight. Thrives in dappled or filtered light, mimicking its natural understory or cloud forest environment. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist, but not waterlogged, as it grows in high rainfall areas. Requires high atmospheric humidity and frequent watering or misting, allowing for good drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Polypodium is a genus of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae, subfamily Polypodioideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). The genus is widely distributed throughout the world, with the highest species diversity in the tropics. The name is derived from Ancient Greek poly ("many") + podion ("little foot"), on account of the foot-like appearance of the rhizome and its branches. They are commonly called polypodies or rockcap ferns, but for many species unique vernacular names exist.
They are terrestrial or epiphytic ferns, with a creeping, densely hairy or scaly rhizome bearing fronds at intervals along its length. The species differ in size and general appearance and in the character of the fronds, which are evergreen, persisting for 1–2 years, pinnate or pinnatifid (rarely simple entire), and from 10 to 80 cm or more long. The sori or groups of spore-cases (sporangia) are borne on the back of the frond; they are globose and naked, not covered with a membrane (indusium).
Polypodies have some use in herbalism, but are today most important in horticulture where several species, hybrids, and their cultivars like Polypodium 'Green Wave' are commonly used as ornamental plants for shady locations. Polypodium have a bitter-sweet taste and are among the rather few ferns that are used in cooking; in this case as a spice e.g. for nougat.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Dotted Polypody, mimic its tropical montane wet forest home by providing consistent moisture, very high humidity, and partial to full shade. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot while keeping the growing medium damp. Feed sparingly with a diluted fertilizer during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient. As an epiphyte/lithophyte, it naturally obtains nutrients from decaying organic matter and rainwater. Use a very diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., quarter strength) once a month during the growing season.
