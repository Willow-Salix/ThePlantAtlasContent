## Care Guide
This hardy plant thrives in sunny, dry, and well-drained conditions, typical of its native steppe and montane environments. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering and fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for xeric gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-drained soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, once a year in spring with a balanced, diluted fertilizer.
