## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Mediterranean, Western Asia (e.g., Greece, Turkey, Middle East) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters) |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its native open, sunny habitats. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering, especially during its active growth phase in spring. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings, as it is adapted to dry summer conditions and does not tolerate waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Papaver somniferum, commonly known as the opium poppy or breadseed poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is the species of plant from which both opium and poppy seeds are derived and is also a valuable ornamental plant grown in gardens. Its native range was the eastern Mediterranean region, but has since been obscured by widespread introduction and cultivation since ancient times to the present day. It is now naturalized across much of the world with temperate climates.
This poppy is grown as an agricultural crop on a large scale, for one of three primary purposes: to produce poppy seeds, to produce opium (for use mainly by the pharmaceutical industry), and to produce other alkaloids (mainly thebaine and oripavine) that are processed by pharmaceutical companies into drugs such as hydrocodone and oxycodone. Each of these goals has special breeds that are targeted at one of these businesses, and breeding efforts (including biotechnological ones) are continually underway. A comparatively small amount of P. somniferum is also produced commercially for ornamental purposes.
Today many varieties have been bred that do not produce a significant quantity of opium. The cultivar 'Sujata' produces no latex at all. Breadseed poppy is more accurate as a common name today because all varieties of P. somniferum produce edible seeds. This differentiation has strong implications for legal policy surrounding the growing of the plant.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its Mediterranean origins. Water moderately during spring growth, reducing frequency as it matures, and avoid over-fertilizing to encourage robust flowering.

### Fertilizer
Generally a light feeder. Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied sparingly during early growth, or if soil is poor. Rich soil can lead to lush foliage but fewer flowers.
