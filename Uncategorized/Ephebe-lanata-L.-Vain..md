| **Native Origin** | Cool temperate to boreal regions across the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in montane and coastal areas of Europe and North America. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Oceanic Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect to partial direct sun, tolerating more direct sun if atmospheric humidity is consistently high. |
| **Watering** | Frequent misting or exposure to high humidity and rainfall, allowing complete drying between wetting cycles. Mimic natural rainfall and fog conditions. |

## Introduction
Ephebos (Greek: ἔφηβος; pl. epheboi, Greek: ἔφηβοι), latinized as ephebus (pl. ephebi) and anglicised as ephebe (pl. ephebes), is a term for a male adolescent in Ancient Greece. The term was particularly used to denote one who was doing military training and preparing to become an adult. From about 335 BC, ephebes from Athens (aged between 18–20) underwent two years of military training under supervision, during which time they were exempt from civic duties and deprived of most civic rights. During the 3rd century BC, ephebic service ceased to be compulsory and its time was reduced to one year. By the 1st century BC, the ephebia became an institution reserved for wealthy individuals and, besides military training, it also included philosophic and literary studies.

## Care Guide
Thread lichen thrives in high atmospheric humidity and good air circulation, mimicking its exposed, rocky native habitat. Provide bright, indirect light to partial sun, and frequent misting, ensuring the lichen dries completely between waterings. Avoid traditional fertilizers as nutrients are absorbed from the air and substrate.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizers required. Lichens absorb nutrients from atmospheric deposition and the minerals leached from their rock substrate.
