## 🌱 Overview
Sedum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, members of which are commonly known as stonecrops. The genus has been described as containing up to 600 species, subsequently reduced to 400–500. They are leaf succulents found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, but extending into the southern hemisphere in Africa and South America. The plants vary from annual and creeping herbs to shrubs. The plants have water-storing leaves. The flowers usually have five petals, seldom four or six. There are typically twice as many stamens as petals. Various species formerly classified as Sedum are now in the segregate genera Hylotelephium and Rhodiola.
Well-known European species of Sedum are Sedum acre, Sedum album, Sedum dasyphyllum, and Sedum hispanicum.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Sedum thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native rocky mountain habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing to maintain its compact growth and health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; prefers lean, poor to moderately fertile soil. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth.
