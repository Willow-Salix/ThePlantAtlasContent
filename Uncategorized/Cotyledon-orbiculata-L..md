## Care Guide
This succulent thrives in bright, sunny conditions and requires infrequent watering, allowing its soil to dry completely between sessions. Mimic its semi-arid native climate by providing excellent drainage and very limited fertilization. Protect from frost.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; apply a diluted succulent fertilizer once or twice during the growing season due to naturally poor soil conditions in its native environment.
