## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization to prevent overgrowth. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid excessive moisture.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
