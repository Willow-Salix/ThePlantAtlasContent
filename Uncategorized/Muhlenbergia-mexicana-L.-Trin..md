## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate North America, specifically parts of Canada, the central and eastern United States, and Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland and Riparian Zones, characterized by humid conditions and found along streambanks or in moist woodlands. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to full sun. Thrives with more sun if soil moisture is consistent, but tolerates partial shade conditions typical of woodland edges. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering is essential to maintain consistently moist soil, mimicking its native streambank and moist woodland habitats. Does not tolerate prolonged dry periods well without establishment. |

## Introduction
Muhlenbergia is a genus of plants in the grass family.
The genus is named in honor of the German-American amateur botanist Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg (1753-1815). Many of the species are known by the common name muhly.
The greatest number are native to the southwestern United States and Mexico, but there are also native species in Canada, Central and South America and in Asia.

## Care Guide
Mexican muhly is an adaptable native grass that thrives in consistently moist soil, preferring conditions found in temperate woodlands and along waterways. It performs well in partial to full sun and requires minimal fertilization, making it a relatively low-maintenance option for suitable garden environments.

### Fertilizer
Low. In its native habitat, it benefits from the natural organic matter of woodland soils. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is sufficient if the soil is poor; otherwise, it is generally not necessary.
