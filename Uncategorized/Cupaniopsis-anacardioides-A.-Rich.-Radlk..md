## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia (coastal Queensland and northern New South Wales) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Coastal Forests and Rainforest Margins |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in full sun but can tolerate some afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, keeping the soil consistently moist but well-drained. Tolerates short dry periods once established, but prefers steady moisture, reflecting its native habitat along waterways and in high-rainfall areas. |

## Introduction
Cupaniopsis anacardioides, commonly known as tuckeroo, cashew-leaf cupania, carrotwood, beach tamarind or green-leaved tamarind, is a species of flowering plant in the family, Sapindaceae, and is native to eastern and northern Australia. It is a tree with paripinnate leaves with 4 to 8 egg-shaped leaflets with the narrower end towards the base, or elliptic leaves, and separate male and female flowers arranged in panicles, the fruit a more or less spherical golden yellow capsule.

## Care Guide
This subtropical tree prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its native coastal and rainforest margin habitat. It is relatively low-maintenance, requiring regular watering, especially when young, and benefits from light fertilization. Once established, it exhibits some drought tolerance but thrives with consistent moisture.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring or a layer of organic compost is generally sufficient, especially in well-draining but not overly rich soils.
