## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States, spanning from New Jersey south to Florida and west to Texas. |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical, typically found in Temperate Deciduous and Mixed Forests, often in sandy or well-drained uplands and pine barrens. |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its nature as a canopy tree in temperate forests. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between watering sessions. Established trees are notably drought-tolerant, reflecting the periodic dry spells in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
An oak is a hardwood tree or shrub in the genus Quercus of the beech family. They have spirally arranged leaves, often with lobed edges, and a nut called an acorn, borne within a cup. The genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, with some 500 species, both deciduous and evergreen. Fossil oaks date back to the Middle Eocene. Molecular phylogeny shows that the genus is divided into Old World and New World clades, but many oak species hybridise freely, making the genus's history difficult to resolve.
Ecologically, oaks are keystone species in habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest. They live in association with many kinds of fungi including truffles. Oaks support more than 950 species of caterpillar, many kinds of gall wasp which form distinctive galls (roundish woody lumps such as the oak apple), and a large number of pests and diseases. Oak leaves and acorns contain enough tannin to be toxic to cattle, but pigs are able to digest them safely. Oak timber is strong and hard, and has found many uses in construction and furniture-making. The bark was traditionally used for tanning leather. Wine barrels are made of oak; these are used for aging alcoholic beverages such as sherry and whisky, giving them a range of flavours, colours, and aromas. The spongy bark of the cork oak is used to make traditional wine bottle corks. Almost a third of oak species are threatened with extinction due to climate change, invasive pests, and habitat loss.
In culture, the oak tree is a symbol of strength and serves as the national tree of many countries. In Indo-European and related religions, the oak is associated with thunder gods. Individual oak trees of cultural significance include the Royal Oak in Britain, the Charter Oak in the United States, and the Guernica Oak in the Basque Country.

## Care Guide
This hybrid oak thrives best in full sun and tolerates a range of soil types, particularly sandy, well-drained conditions. While young trees benefit from consistent moisture, established plants are quite drought-tolerant, requiring moderate watering that allows the soil to dry between sessions. Fertilization is generally low, needed primarily for young trees or those in very poor soils to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, primarily for young trees or those planted in very poor soils. Established trees in healthy soil rarely require supplemental feeding.
