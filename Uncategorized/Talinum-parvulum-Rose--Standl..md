## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in sunny, arid conditions, preferring well-draining soil and infrequent watering due to its drought tolerance. It requires minimal fertilization, making it an easy-care option for dry environments.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; a light, balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, or none if planted in good quality soil.
