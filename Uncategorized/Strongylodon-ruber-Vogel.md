## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet to Mesic Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect to partial sun. As a forest vine, it thrives with good light to promote flowering but should be protected from intense, direct midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained, reflecting its native habitat's regular rainfall. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Strongylodon is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It includes 16 species of lianas native to the western Pacific, from the Philippines and Sulawesi to New Guinea, Queensland, and the south Pacific, and to Madagascar, Réunion, and the Comoro and Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean. Typical habitats are tropical rain forest, thicket, or secondary vegetation, often in wetlands and near water. Some species can grow up to 40 meters long. The genus belongs to the subfamily Faboideae. The most well-known species in the genus is Strongylodon macrobotrys, also known as jade vine.

## Care Guide
The Hawai'i Jadevine requires conditions mirroring its native tropical forest habitat: consistent moisture, high humidity, and bright, indirect light. Provide a well-draining soil mix and regular fertilization during growth to support its vigorous vining and unique flowering habit.

### Fertilizer
Monthly during the active growing season with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer. Given its family (Fabaceae), it may fix some nitrogen, so a slightly lower nitrogen formulation can be beneficial.
