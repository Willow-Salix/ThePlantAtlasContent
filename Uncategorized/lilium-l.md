## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Across the Northern Hemisphere, including temperate regions of Asia (e.g., China, Japan, Korea), Europe, and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forests, Woodlands, Mountain Meadows, and Grasslands. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, typically preferring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day for best flowering, with some tolerance for dappled light in warmer climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering during the growing season to maintain consistently moist but not waterlogged soil; good drainage is crucial to prevent bulb rot, especially in their dormant period. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lilium ( LIL-ee-əm) is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants growing from bulbs, all with large and often prominent flowers. Lilies are a group of flowering plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world. Most species are native to the Northern Hemisphere and their range is temperate climates and extends into the subtropics. Many other plants have "lily" in their common names, but do not belong to the same genus and are therefore not true lilies. True lilies are known to be highly toxic to cats.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lilies, originating from diverse temperate regions, thrive in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil to prevent bulb rot. Provide moderate feeding with a balanced fertilizer during their active growth period, particularly in spring. This care strategy mimics their natural habitat for vigorous growth and abundant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring as new growth emerges, and potentially a lighter feeding after flowering.
