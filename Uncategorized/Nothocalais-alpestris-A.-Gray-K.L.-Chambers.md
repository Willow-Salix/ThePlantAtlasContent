## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically high-altitude regions of the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada mountains. |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Tundra/Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking high-altitude exposure above the treeline. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistent moisture, especially during dry periods, but absolutely requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot in its native well-drained rocky soils. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Mimic its native high-altitude environment by providing full, intense sun exposure and consistently moist yet very well-drained soil. It is adapted to lean conditions, so fertilization should be minimal or unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean, rocky alpine soils. A very light, balanced granular fertilizer can be applied once in early spring, but often unnecessary in good soil.
