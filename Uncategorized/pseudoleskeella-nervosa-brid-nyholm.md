## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss requires a consistently moist and humid environment with low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its natural forest habitat. Ensure consistent moisture without waterlogging and avoid direct sun. Fertilization is generally not necessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. Mosses have minimal nutrient demands and can be harmed by excessive fertilization. If absolutely necessary, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied very sparingly.
