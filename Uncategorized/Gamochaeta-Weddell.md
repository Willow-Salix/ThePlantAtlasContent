## Care Guide
This 'everlasting' plant prefers full sun and temperate conditions, mirroring its native South American grasslands. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and use fertilizer sparingly due to its low nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require heavy feeding. A light application of a balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth is poor.
