## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (specifically Utah, Nevada, Arizona, California, Idaho, Oregon) |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland and Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), tolerating intense sun and heat typical of its native open habitats. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently but deeply, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires excellent drainage and is highly susceptible to root rot in soggy conditions. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This Penstemon variety thrives in conditions mimicking its native Western U.S. arid scrubland habitat. Provide full sun and very well-draining soil, watering infrequently once established. Avoid over-fertilizing and soggy soil to ensure robust growth and abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Thrives in lean, well-drained soils. Over-fertilization can promote lush foliage at the expense of flowers and lead to weaker growth.
