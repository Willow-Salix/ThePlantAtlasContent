## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Asia (China, Korea, Japan) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in full sun, especially in cooler climates, but benefits from some afternoon shade in hotter regions to protect foliage from scorch. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist, but well-drained soil. Allow the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry slightly between waterings. Increase frequency during hot, dry periods. |

## Introduction
Acer buergerianum (trident maple; simplified Chinese: 三角枫; traditional Chinese: 三角楓; pinyin: sānjiǎofēng) is a species of maple native to eastern China (from Shandong west to southeastern Gansu, south to Guangdong, and southwest to Sichuan), Taiwan and Japan. The specific epithet is a patronym honoring Dutch plant hunter J. Buerger (1804-1858).

## Care Guide
The Trident Maple thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting its native temperate forest environment. Regular watering during the growing season and moderate fertilization in spring will support its robust growth and health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, or a liquid feed monthly from spring to mid-summer. Avoid fertilizing in late summer or fall.
