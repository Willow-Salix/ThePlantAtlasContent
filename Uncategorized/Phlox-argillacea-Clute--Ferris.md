## Care Guide
Clay Phlox thrives in temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is relatively low-maintenance, requiring moderate watering and only occasional fertilization. Native to Midwestern US prairies, it is hardy and resilient.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a light application of balanced granular fertilizer in spring, especially in poorer soils, but generally not a heavy feeder.
