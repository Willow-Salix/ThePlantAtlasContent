## Care Guide
Climbing Nightshade thrives in temperate conditions, preferring consistently moist soil and adaptable to a range of light from partial shade to full sun. It requires moderate watering and minimal fertilization, reflecting its robust nature in its native, often disturbed, habitats.

### Fertilizer
Average fertility; benefits from a general-purpose fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season, consistent with its ability to colonize disturbed sites.
