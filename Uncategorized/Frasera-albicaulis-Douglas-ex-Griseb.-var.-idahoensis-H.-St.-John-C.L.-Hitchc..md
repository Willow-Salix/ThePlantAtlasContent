| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in open, exposed locations characteristic of its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings as it is adapted to dry, well-drained conditions and is drought-tolerant once established. |

## Care Guide
Idaho frasera requires full sun to partial sun exposure and well-drained soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between applications, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor montane soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; plants from such environments are typically adapted to lean soils and do not require heavy fertilization.
