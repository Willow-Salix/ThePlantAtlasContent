## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to indirect light. Thrives in shaded or partially shaded conditions, often on forest floors or under canopy cover; direct sun should be avoided as it can cause desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity is essential. This lichen absorbs moisture from the air and precipitation; frequent misting or a consistently humid environment is necessary. Avoid waterlogging, but do not allow it to dry out for extended periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Peltigera is a genus of approximately 100 species of foliose lichens in the family Peltigeraceae. Commonly known as the dog or pelt lichens, species of Peltigera are often terricolous (growing on soil), but can also occur on moss, trees, rocks, and many other substrates in many parts of the world.
Most species of Peltigera have the cyanobacterium Nostoc as the dominant photobiont but some have the algae Coccomyxa. The presence of both a green alga and a cyanobacterium makes some tripartite; in this case they show cephalodium growths containing the third partner, Nostoc. Because of their ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, such lichens are influential in soil composition and generation.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, humid, and shaded environments, mimicking its native forest floor habitat. Provide consistent moisture through high ambient humidity and regular misting, ensuring it receives only low to indirect light. Fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental to its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from air and rainfall and are sensitive to added chemicals or pollutants.
