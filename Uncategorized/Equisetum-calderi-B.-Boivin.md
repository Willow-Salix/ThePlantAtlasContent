## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Queen Charlotte Islands (Haida Gwaii), British Columbia, Canada |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforest (Boggy areas, marshes, and along water bodies) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to full sun, tolerating higher light levels with consistent moisture. |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to saturated soil, mimicking its native boggy and aquatic environments. Should never be allowed to dry out. |

## Introduction
Equisetum (; horsetail) is the only living genus in Equisetaceae, a family of vascular plants that reproduce by spores rather than seeds.
Equisetum is a "living fossil", the only living genus of the entire subclass Equisetidae, which for over 100 million years was much more diverse and dominated the understorey of late Paleozoic forests. Some equisetids were large trees reaching to 30 m (98 ft) tall. The genus Calamites of the family Calamitaceae, for example, is abundant in coal deposits from the Carboniferous period. The pattern of spacing of nodes in horsetails, wherein those toward the apex of the shoot are increasingly close together, is said to have inspired John Napier to invent logarithms. Modern horsetails first appeared during the Jurassic period.
A superficially similar but entirely unrelated flowering plant genus, mare's tail (Hippuris), is occasionally referred to as "horsetail", and adding to confusion, the name "mare's tail" is sometimes applied to Equisetum.

## Care Guide
This rare hybrid horsetail thrives in consistently wet, boggy conditions or standing water, typical of its temperate rainforest origin. Provide partial to full sun exposure and maintain continuously saturated soil. Fertilization should be minimal, as these plants are not heavy feeders.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
