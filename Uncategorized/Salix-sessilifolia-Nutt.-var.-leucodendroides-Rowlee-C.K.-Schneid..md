## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Pacific Northwest (USA: California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana; Canada: British Columbia), often along major river systems like the Columbia River. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Riparian Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; thrives best in full sun exposure typical of open riverbanks and wet areas. |
| **Watering** | High water needs; requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native riparian habitat along streams and rivers. It does not tolerate drought. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This willow thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet or moist soil, reflecting its native habitat along rivers and streams in the Pacific Northwest. Provide moderate fertilization if soil is poor, otherwise, it generally does well in nutrient-rich riparian sediments.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer in spring, particularly in less fertile soils. In naturally rich riparian sediments, heavy fertilization may not be necessary.
