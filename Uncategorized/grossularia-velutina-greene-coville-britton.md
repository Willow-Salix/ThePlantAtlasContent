## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant gooseberry thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native arid scrubland and chaparral habitats. It requires minimal watering once established and generally needs no fertilization, adapting to lean soil conditions. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.
