## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Greater Antilles (Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Puerto Rico) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest; Montane Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Very low to indirect light; requires consistent shade or heavily filtered sun to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is essential. Keep substrate constantly moist but ensure good drainage. Requires frequent misting or placement in an enclosed high-humidity environment like a terrarium. |

## Introduction
Hymenophyllum is a genus of ferns in the family Hymenophyllaceae. Its name means "membranous leaf", referring to the very thin translucent tissue of the fronds, which gives rise to the common name filmy fern for this and other thin-leaved ferns. The leaves are generally only one cell thick and lack stomata, making them vulnerable to desiccation.  Consequently, they are found only in very humid areas, such as in moist forests and among sheltered rocks. They are small and easy to overlook.

## Care Guide
The Antilles Filmy Fern thrives in consistently high humidity and very low light, mimicking its native rainforest understory habitat. It requires a constantly moist but well-draining substrate and very minimal fertilization to prevent damage to its delicate, single-cell-thick fronds.

### Fertilizer
Extremely light feeder. Apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/8 strength) very sparingly, perhaps once a month during active growth or even less frequently.
