## Introduction
Cleomella is a genus of flowering plants. It includes 22 species of native to North America, ranging from southern Mexico through the western and central United States to western and central Canada. Like their relatives, the cleomes, plants of this genus have traditionally been included in the caper family Capparaceae but have recently been moved into a new family, Cleomaceae. Cleomella are annual wildflowers native to the dry and desert regions of western North America. They are similar to cleomes in appearance. They are erect and branching with leaves divided into three leaflets and inflorescences of yellow flowers with long stamens. Cleomella species are known commonly as stinkweeds or simply cleomellas.

## Care Guide
Palmer's Wislizenia is a highly adapted desert plant that demands full sun and well-draining, lean soil to mimic its arid native climate. Water sparingly and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization to ensure its health.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils typical of deserts and generally requires minimal to no fertilizer. If desired, a very dilute, balanced formula can be applied once a year in spring.
