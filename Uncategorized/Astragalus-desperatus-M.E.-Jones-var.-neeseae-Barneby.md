## Care Guide
Elizabeth's Milkvetch thrives in conditions mimicking its arid native habitat, requiring full sun and very minimal water. It prefers poor, unfertilized soil and will not tolerate overwatering or rich growing mediums.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, or shale soils. Fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful.
