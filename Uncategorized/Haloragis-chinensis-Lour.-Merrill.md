## Care Guide
Haloragis chinensis prefers full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil to mimic its native tropical monsoon climate. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, and fertilize moderately during its active growth phase for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize with a balanced, general-purpose liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season, or use a slow-release granular fertilizer. Reduce or cease feeding during dormant periods.
