## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine liverwort thrives in cold, consistently moist, and well-drained conditions with partial to bright indirect light. Replicate its native snowbed environment by maintaining high humidity and avoiding nutrient-rich substrates and high temperatures.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to none. Liverworts are adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Any conventional fertilizer would likely be detrimental.
