## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eurasia and North Africa, particularly prevalent in regions with Mediterranean, temperate, and continental steppe climates, such as Southern Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Steppe to Mediterranean. Characterized by cold to mild winters, wet springs, and hot, often dry summers, leading to a period of dormancy. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. As a grassland species, it is accustomed to open, exposed areas with high light intensity. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during its active growth phase in spring. Highly drought-tolerant once established; requires little to no watering during summer dormancy. Ensure well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native temperate steppe and Mediterranean habitats. Water moderately in spring, then reduce significantly or cease during its summer dormancy due to its drought tolerance. Minimal fertilization is needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It is adapted to relatively poor or disturbed soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring can promote vigorous growth.
