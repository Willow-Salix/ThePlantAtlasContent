## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (Northeastern and North-central USA, Southeastern Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest (often in moist, shaded understory) |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade; avoid direct sun as it can scorch the fronds. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist; do not allow to dry out between waterings. Prefers high humidity. |

## Introduction
The moth genus Dryopteris is now considered a junior synonym of Oreta.

Dryopteris , commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to Dryopteris filix-mas), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales.
Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American Dryopteris hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization.
The fossil record of this genus shows that it was widespread even as far back as the Cretaceous with fossils being found in Late Cretaceous rock layers from North America down to Antarctica.

## Care Guide
Clinton's woodfern thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, mirroring its native temperate forest understory. It requires consistently moist, rich soil and high humidity, making it suitable for shaded garden spots or as an indoor plant with adequate moisture and protection from direct sun.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season, or enrich soil with compost/organic matter.
