## Care Guide
Centrostegia thurberi, or red triangles, thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its native arid scrubland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering with excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor desert soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilization; adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils. If fertilized, use a very dilute, balanced formula sparingly during active growth.
