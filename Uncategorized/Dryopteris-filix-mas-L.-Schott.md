## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across the temperate Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland/Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade, preferring dappled light similar to a forest floor. Avoid direct, intense afternoon sun which can scorch fronds. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water regularly, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly between waterings, especially during warmer months. |

## Introduction
Dryopteris filix-mas, the male fern, is a common fern of the temperate Northern Hemisphere, native to much of Europe, Asia, and North America. It favours damp shaded areas in the understory of woodlands, but also shady places on hedge-banks, and rocks, and screes. Near the northern limit of its distribution it prefers sunny, well-drained sites. It is much less abundant in North America than in Europe.

## Care Guide
The Male Fern thrives in cool, shaded environments with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native woodland habitat. Protect it from direct sun exposure and provide moderate humidity to ensure robust frond development.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding during the growing season (spring to early summer) with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer or by incorporating organic matter into the soil, as native woodland soils are often rich in humus.
