## Care Guide
This ephemeral spring wildflower thrives in cool, moist, shaded conditions typical of temperate deciduous forests. Provide consistently moist, organically rich soil during its active growth in early spring, allowing it to go dormant and tolerate drier conditions in summer. Plant in partial to full shade to mimic its natural understory habitat.

### Fertilizer
Prefers rich, well-draining soil high in organic matter, mimicking its native forest floor. A light application of compost or organic fertilizer can be beneficial in fall or early spring.
