## Introduction
Lygodesmia, called skeletonplant, is a genus of North American flowering plants in the tribe Cichorieae within the family Asteraceae.
The name derives from the Greek lygos, a pliant twig, and desme, a bundle, because of the fascicled twiggy or rush-like stems of the plants.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun, requiring minimal water once established due to its arid grassland origins. Ensure well-draining soil and avoid excessive fertilization to mimic its natural environment. It is a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny locations.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required; thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile, well-drained soils.
