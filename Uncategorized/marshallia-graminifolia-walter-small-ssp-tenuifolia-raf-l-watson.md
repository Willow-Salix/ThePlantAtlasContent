## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in a humid subtropical climate, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist to wet soil conditions. It is not a heavy feeder and can tolerate less fertile soils, but a light annual fertilization can promote robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Can tolerate nutrient-poor, acidic soils but benefits from a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, particularly in cultivated environments.
