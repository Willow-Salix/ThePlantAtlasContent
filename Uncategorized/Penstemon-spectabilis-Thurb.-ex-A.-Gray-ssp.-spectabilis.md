## Care Guide
Showy Penstemon thrives in conditions mimicking its native southern California chaparral. It requires full sun, excellent drainage, and is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing infrequent watering. Fertilization should be minimal, as it prefers lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low. Generally does not require much fertilizer. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied in spring if growth is poor, but avoid high nitrogen.
