## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded environments, mimicking its native woodland habitat. Ensure good drainage and avoid direct sunlight, as it can quickly dry out. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as it absorbs nutrients from its surroundings.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none; mosses absorb nutrients from rainwater and atmospheric dust, and excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
