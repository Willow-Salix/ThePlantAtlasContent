## Introduction
Rosa blanda, commonly known as the smooth rose, meadow/wild rose, or prairie rose, is a species of rose native to North America. Among roses, it is closest to a "thornless" rose, with just a few thorns at the base. The meadow rose occurs as a colony-forming shrub growing to 1 m (3.3 ft) high, naturally in prairies and meadows. The roses are quite variable, the characteristics such as leaf tip number of prickles and glandular hairs usually do not always remain constant, thus it is often confused with Rosa arkansana or Rosa carolina, the two other prairie rose species.

## Care Guide
The Smooth Rose, native to temperate North American woodlands and grasslands, thrives in full sun to partial shade with moderate, consistent watering. It prefers well-drained, average to rich soil, benefiting from an annual fertilizer application. This hardy rose is relatively low-maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Thrives in average to rich, well-drained soils. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost amendment in spring can support vigorous growth.
