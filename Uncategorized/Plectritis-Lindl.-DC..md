## Introduction
Valeriana is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae, members of which may be commonly known as valerians. It contains many species, including the garden valerian, Valeriana officinalis. Valeriana has centers of diversity in Eurasia and South America (especially in the Andes), and is represented by native species on all continents except Antarctica. 
Some species have been introduced to parts of the world outside their native range, including Valeriana rubra in the western United States and Valeriana macrosiphon in Western Australia.

## Care Guide
Seablush thrives in temperate, seasonally moist environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires consistent moisture during its spring growing season, becoming drought-tolerant as it goes dormant in summer. Fertilization is generally minimal, reflecting its adaptability to moderate soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial in very poor soils, but generally not heavily required.
