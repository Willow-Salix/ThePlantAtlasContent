## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Europe and Western Asia, as a hybrid of species native to temperate riparian zones. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Riparian Zone |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Sun; thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking open riverside conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil and does not tolerate drought. Naturally found in waterlogged areas or along riverbanks. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hybrid willows are vigorous, sun-loving plants that thrive in temperate climates. They demand consistently wet or moist soil, reflecting their natural habitat along riverbanks and wetlands, and benefit from moderate fertilization to support their rapid growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; generally benefits from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring, especially if soil is lean, but often thrives in naturally nutrient-rich alluvial soils.
