## Introduction
Parthenium is a genus of North American annuals, biennials, perennials, subshrubs, and shrubs in the tribe Heliantheae within the family Asteraceae and subfamily Asteroideae.
The name Parthenium is an evolution of the Ancient Greek name παρθένιον (parthenion), which referred to Tanacetum parthenium. The name is possibly derived from the Greek word παρθένος (parthenos) which means "virgin".
Members of the genus are commonly known as feverfew. Notable species include guayule (P. argentatum) which has been used as a rubber substitute, especially during the Second World War; and also P. hysterophorus, a serious invasive species in the Old World.

## Care Guide
Wild Quinine is a robust perennial that thrives in full sun within temperate grassland and open woodland environments. It requires moderate watering, becoming very drought-tolerant once established, and generally needs minimal fertilization. This makes it a low-maintenance option for sunny, well-drained garden spots.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typically not a heavy feeder, but can benefit from a light application of balanced fertilizer in poor soils.
