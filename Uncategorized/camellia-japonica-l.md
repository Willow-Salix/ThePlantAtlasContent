## 🌱 Overview
Camellia (pronounced  or ) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Theaceae. They are found in tropical and subtropical areas in eastern and southern Asia, from the Himalayas east to Japan and Indonesia. There are more than 220 described species; almost all are found in southern China and Indochina. Camellias are popular ornamental, tea, and woody-oil plants cultivated worldwide for centuries. Over 26,000 cultivars, with more than 51,000 cultivar names, including synonyms, have been registered or published.
The leaves of C. sinensis are processed to create tea, and so are of particular economic importance in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent, with the processed leaves widely sold and consumed globally. The ornamental C. japonica, C. sasanqua and their hybrids are the source of hundreds of garden cultivars. C. oleifera produces tea seed oil, used in cooking and cosmetics.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Camellias thrive in partial shade with consistent moisture, requiring well-drained, acidic soil rich in organic matter. Protect them from harsh afternoon sun and feed with an acid-specific fertilizer during their active growth period to encourage vibrant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires nutrient-rich, acidic soil. Fertilize with a slow-release, acid-forming fertilizer in early spring and early summer, specifically formulated for acid-loving plants.
