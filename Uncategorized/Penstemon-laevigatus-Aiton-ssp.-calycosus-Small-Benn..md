## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
Plant Calyx Beardtongue in full sun to partial shade with excellent drainage. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, as it is susceptible to rot in consistently wet conditions. It prefers lean soils, so avoid over-fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Prefers average to lean soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. An annual light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if soil is very poor.
