## Introduction
Madia is a genus of annual or perennial usually aromatic herbs with yellow flowers, in the tribe Madieae within the family Asteraceae.
They are sometimes known as tarweeds. The species in this genus are native to western North America and southwestern South America. The name Madia is derived from native Chilean name ("Madi") for one of the members of the genus (Madia sativa). Tarweeds derive their common name from the intense stickiness of the plant.

## Care Guide
Stebbins' Madia thrives in Mediterranean-like conditions, preferring full sun and well-drained, often nutrient-poor soils. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing infrequent watering mainly during its active spring growth if natural rainfall is lacking. Minimal to no fertilization is required to maintain its health.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, often serpentine soils, requiring minimal to no fertilization.
