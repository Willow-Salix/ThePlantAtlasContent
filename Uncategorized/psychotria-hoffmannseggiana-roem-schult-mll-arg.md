## 🌱 Overview
Psychotria is a large genus of flowering plants in the coffee family Rubiaceae, with over 1,600 species. The genus has a pantropical distribution and members of the genus are small understorey trees in tropical forests. Some species are endangered or facing extinction due to deforestation, especially species of central Africa and the Pacific.
Many species, including Psychotria viridis, produce the psychedelic chemical dimethyltryptamine (DMT).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant requires a humid environment with consistently moist soil and thrives in indirect light, similar to its tropical rainforest understory habitat. Protect from direct sun and ensure good drainage to prevent root rot. Feed moderately during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer) due to its presence in nutrient-rich but also potentially leached forest soils.
