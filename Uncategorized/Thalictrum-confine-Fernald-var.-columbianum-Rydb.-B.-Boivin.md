## Introduction
Thalictrum ( ) is a genus of 120-200 species of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae, native mostly to temperate regions. Meadow-rue is a common name for plants in this genus.
Thalictrum is a taxonomically difficult genus with poorly understood species boundaries; it is in need of further taxonomic and field research for clarification.
Despite their common name of "meadow-rue", Thalictrum species are not closely related to the true rue (family Rutaceae), but resemble its members in having compound leaves twice or thrice divided.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in temperate montane and subalpine environments, requiring consistently moist soil and tolerating partial to full sun, with a preference for afternoon shade in hotter climates. Provide average soil fertility, enriched with organic matter, for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Average soil fertility; benefits from a light application of balanced organic fertilizer or compost in spring to mimic nutrient cycling in its native habitat.
