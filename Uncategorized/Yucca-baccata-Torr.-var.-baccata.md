## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, Utah, Nevada, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun, as it naturally grows in open, exposed desert and semi-arid environments. Can tolerate very light partial shade. |
| **Watering** | Very low watering needs; highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly in cooler months. |

## Introduction
Yucca baccata (datil yucca or banana yucca, also known as Spanish bayonet and broadleaf yucca) is a common species of yucca native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, from southeastern California north to Utah, east to western Texas and south to Sonora and Chihuahua. It is also reported in the wild in Colombia.
The species gets its common name "banana yucca" from its banana-shaped fruit. The specific epithet baccata means 'with berries'. Banana yucca is closely related to the Yucca schidigera, the Mojave yucca, with which it is interspersed where their ranges overlap; hybrids between them occur.

## Care Guide
Thriving in its native arid scrubland and desert environments, the Banana Yucca requires full sun and extremely infrequent watering, tolerating drought conditions well. Ensure excellent drainage and minimal fertilization to mimic its natural, lean habitat. Overwatering is the most common cause of decline for this plant.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, once a year in spring with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer, or none if planted in well-amended native soil.
