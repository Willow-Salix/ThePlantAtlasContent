## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico south through Central America to Colombia and Venezuela |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade, preferring filtered light or protection from direct sun, typical of an understory palm. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, well-draining soil is crucial; high humidity is also preferred due to its rainforest origins. |

## Introduction
Pacaya is an active complex volcano in Guatemala, which first erupted approximately 23,000 years ago and has erupted at least 23 times since the Spanish conquest of Guatemala. It rises to an elevation of 2,552 metres (8,373 ft). After being dormant for over 70 years, it began erupting vigorously in 1961 and has been erupting frequently since then. Much of its activity is Strombolian, but occasionally Plinian eruptions also occur, sometimes showering the area of the nearby Departments with ash.
Pacaya is a popular tourist attraction. It is even the home to the popular Guatemala Impact Marathon which pioneered the use of a running route across the lava field created by the 2010 eruption and supports the local communities through runners endeavouring to complete the challenge. It lies 30 kilometers (19 miles) southwest of Guatemala City and close to Antigua. The volcano sits inside the Escuintla Department. Volcano Boarding is also practiced on the craters of Pacaya.
Villagers near Pacaya ignored an evacuation request as the volcano threw ash into the air in March 2021.

## Care Guide
This palm thrives in indirect light or partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native tropical understory. High humidity is beneficial, and light fertilization during active growth will support its health.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced palm fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer) is sufficient, reflecting the constant, moderate nutrient cycling in its native habitat.
