## Care Guide
Rubus avipes thrives in cool, moist environments typical of its Appalachian mountain origins. It prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. A balanced fertilizer in spring will support vigorous growth and fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, balanced fertilizer applied in early spring. Native soils are often rich in organic matter, so supplemental feeding is beneficial if soil quality is poor.
