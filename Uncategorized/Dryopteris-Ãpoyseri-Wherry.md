## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, particularly the Appalachian region and surrounding moist woodlands where its parent species overlap. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest (Humid Continental Climate) characterized by cool, moist, shaded woodland understories. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial to full shade. Direct, intense sunlight should be avoided as it can scorch the fronds. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, especially during the growing season. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, but also ensure good drainage. |

## Introduction
The moth genus Dryopteris is now considered a junior synonym of Oreta.

Dryopteris , commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to Dryopteris filix-mas), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales.
Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American Dryopteris hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization.
The fossil record of this genus shows that it was widespread even as far back as the Cretaceous with fossils being found in Late Cretaceous rock layers from North America down to Antarctica.

## Care Guide
This woodland fern thrives in cool, shaded conditions with consistently moist, rich soil. Protect it from direct sun and ensure regular watering to mimic its native habitat, avoiding waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderately rich, organic soil. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer during the spring and early summer growing period, or incorporate compost.
