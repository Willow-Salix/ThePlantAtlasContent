| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade. Thrives in dappled sunlight or morning sun with protection from harsh afternoon sun, mimicking its native woodland understory habitat. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil. Requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, to prevent the soil from drying out completely. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Waldsteinia, the barren strawberries, is a genus of the rose family (Rosaceae).  It contains about six species native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere.  A number of species are cultivated as a ground cover in gardens, including Waldsteinia fragarioides from North America, Waldsteinia geoides from Europe, Waldsteinia lobata, and Waldsteinia ternata from Eurasia (from Central Europe to Siberia, China, and Japan).

## Care Guide
This woodland native thrives in partial to full shade with consistently moist, organically rich, well-drained soil. Protect it from intense afternoon sun and ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, to mimic its natural temperate forest environment.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, organic soil. Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or an annual application of compost in spring is sufficient. Avoid over-fertilizing.
