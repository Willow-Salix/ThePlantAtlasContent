## Care Guide
Mexican Cliffrose thrives in full sun and well-drained, rocky soils. It is a highly drought-tolerant plant, requiring infrequent, deep watering once established, and has minimal fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low nutrient needs; rarely requires fertilization, as it is adapted to poor, rocky, native desert soils.
