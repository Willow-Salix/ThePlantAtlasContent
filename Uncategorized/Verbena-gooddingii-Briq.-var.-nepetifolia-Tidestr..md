## Introduction
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## Care Guide
This desert-native Verbena thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its arid origins. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and has very low fertilizer needs. Mimicking its natural environment ensures healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low; native to lean desert soils. No fertilization is typically needed, or a very light, balanced fertilizer application once in spring if grown in poor soil.
