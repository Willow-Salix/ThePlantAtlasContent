## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
Compacted Button Lichen, a crustose lichen of temperate rocky outcrops, requires moderate to high indirect light and regular atmospheric moisture, balanced with good air circulation to prevent prolonged wetness. It is sensitive to direct fertilization, obtaining sufficient nutrients from its natural environment.
