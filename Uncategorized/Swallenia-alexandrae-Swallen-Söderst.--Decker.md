## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eureka Valley Dunes, Inyo County, California, USA |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland (specifically active sand dunes within the Mojave Desert) |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full, direct sun exposure for at least 6-8 hours daily, consistent with its open, exposed dune habitat. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the sandy soil to dry out completely between waterings. Mimic sporadic desert rainfall. |

## Introduction
Swallenia is a rare monotypic genus of plants in the grass family, found only in Death Valley National Park, California.
The only known species is Swallenia alexandrae, known by the common names Eureka dunegrass and Eureka Valley dune grass.  This genus was named for American botanist Jason Richard Swallen (who specialized in grasses), while the species name was in honor of American philanthropist, museum founder, and paleontologist Annie Montague Alexander.

## Care Guide
Eureka Dunegrass thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid dune environment, requiring full sun and extremely well-drained, nutrient-poor soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to completely dry out between deep waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to harsh desert conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. Its natural habitat in sand dunes is nutrient-poor, so it thrives in lean soils.
