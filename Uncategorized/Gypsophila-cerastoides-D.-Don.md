## Introduction
Gypsophila () is a genus of flowering plants in the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae. They are native to Eurasia, Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Turkey has a particularly high diversity of Gypsophila taxa, with about 35 endemic species. Some Gypsophila are introduced species in other regions.
The genus name is from the Greek gypsos ("gypsum") and philios ("loving"), a reference to the gypsum-rich substrates on which some species grow. Plants of the genus are known commonly as baby's-breath, or bebe's breath, a name which also refers specifically to the well known ornamental species Gypsophila paniculata.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained, gritty soil, mimicking its native Himalayan habitat. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions, and use fertilizer very sparingly due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot, as wet feet are detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soil. A light, balanced feed once in spring is sufficient if desired.
