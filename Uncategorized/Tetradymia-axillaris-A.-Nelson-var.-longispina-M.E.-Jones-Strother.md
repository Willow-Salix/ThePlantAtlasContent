## Care Guide
Longspine horsebrush thrives in hot, sunny, and dry conditions characteristic of its native desert scrubland. It requires full sun and very infrequent watering, being highly drought-tolerant. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor desert soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a diluted all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season.
