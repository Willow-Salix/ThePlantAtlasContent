## Care Guide
This grass thrives in full sun, requiring ample light like its native grasslands. Water moderately during its growing period, ensuring the soil dries between sessions, and provide minimal fertilization. It is generally hardy and drought-tolerant once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring is generally sufficient.
