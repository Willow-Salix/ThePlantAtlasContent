| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, primarily Brazil (Atlantic Forest biome) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Humid Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light or partial shade is ideal, mimicking its natural habitat beneath a forest canopy or at forest edges. Avoid intense, direct midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, reflecting its native humid environment with abundant rainfall. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly before rewatering, ensuring good drainage to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Pilocarpus is a genus of about 13 species of plants belonging to the family Rutaceae, native to the Neotropics of South America. Various species are important pharmacologically as a source of the parasympathomimetic alkaloid pilocarpine. Many of the species have the common name jaborandi.

## Care Guide
Pilocarpus thrives in conditions that mimic its humid forest origins, preferring bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Regular feeding during warmer months supports vigorous growth. Ensure high humidity to prevent leaf issues.

### Fertilizer
Benefit from regular feeding during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer. Reduce or stop fertilizing in fall and winter.
