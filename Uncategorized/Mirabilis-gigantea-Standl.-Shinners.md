## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent but deep watering once established. Fertilize sparingly to promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring, or a diluted liquid fertilizer a few times during the growing season, should suffice. Thrives in leaner soils.
