## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean and montane chaparral habitat. It is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, with minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. As a legume, this plant fixes nitrogen, so high-nitrogen fertilizers are unnecessary and can be detrimental. A light, balanced phosphorus and potassium supplement may be beneficial in very poor soils.
