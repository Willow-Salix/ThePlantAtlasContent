## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
As a crustose lichen thriving on exposed siliceous rocks, Lecidea confluens demands high to moderate light and a distinct cycle of wetness and prolonged dryness. It requires no supplemental fertilization, acquiring all necessary nutrients from its atmospheric and rock environment.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required; obtains essential nutrients passively from air, precipitation, and trace elements from the rock substrate.
