## Quick Facts

| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (primarily coastal Southern California) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours direct sunlight daily) to light partial shade, especially in hotter inland areas. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant. Requires excellent drainage. Water sparingly after establishment, typically only during prolonged dry spells in the cooler months, and significantly reduce or cease watering entirely during hot, dry summers. |

## Introduction
Monardella is a genus of approximately 40 species of annual and perennial plants native to western North America from British Columbia to northwestern Mexico. They are grown for their highly aromatic foliage, which in some species is used for herbal teas. The two-lipped, tubular flowers are formed in terminal clusters and are most usually red, pink, or purple.
Monardella is a Latin diminutive form of Monarda (a taxonomic patronym honoring the Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes), which the form of the flower heads resembles.  Plants in this genus are commonly known as wildmints, coyote mints or monardellas.

## Care Guide
This California native thrives in conditions mimicking its Mediterranean chaparral habitat, requiring abundant sunlight and very little water once established. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid excessive fertilization to promote healthy growth, especially in summer.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental. If growth is poor, a very light, balanced, slow-release native plant fertilizer once in early spring might be considered, but generally avoid.
