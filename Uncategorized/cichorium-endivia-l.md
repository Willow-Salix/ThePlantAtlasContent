## 🌱 Overview
Cichorium is a genus of plants in the tribe Cichorieae within the family Asteraceae.  The genus includes two cultivated species commonly known as chicory or endive, plus several wild species.

Common chicory (Cichorium intybus) is a bushy perennial herb with blue or lavender (or, rarely, white or pink) flowers. It grows as a wild plant on roadsides in its native Europe, and in North America, where it has become naturalized.  It is grown for its leaves, when it is known as leaf chicory, endive, radicchio, Belgian endive, French endive, or witloof.  Other varieties are grown for their roots, which are used as a coffee substitute, similar to dandelion coffee.
True endive (Cichorium endivia) is a species grown and used as a salad green. It has a slightly bitter taste. Curly endive and the broad-leafed escarole are true endives.
Cichorium is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including setaceous Hebrew character,  turnip moth, and the grass moth Diasemia reticularis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cultivated Endive, originating from the Mediterranean, thrives in full sun and well-draining, moderately fertile soil. Consistent watering is crucial for lush leaf development, though it can tolerate short dry spells once established. Provide regular feeding for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in moderately rich, well-draining soil. Benefits from incorporating organic matter or a balanced fertilizer application during the growing period.
