## 🧤 Care Instructions
This foliicolous lichen thrives in a stable, high-humidity environment with indirect light, mimicking its natural tropical forest understory habitat. It depends on consistent atmospheric moisture for survival and does not require traditional soil or fertilizer, obtaining its minimal nutrients from the air and host leaf.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Lichens primarily obtain nutrients from atmospheric deposition and their substrate. Traditional fertilization is not applicable and could be detrimental.
