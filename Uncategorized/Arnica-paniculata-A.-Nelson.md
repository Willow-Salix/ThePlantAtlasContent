## Introduction
Arnica  is a genus of perennial, herbaceous plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). The genus name Arnica may be derived from the Greek arni, "lamb", in reference to the plants' soft, hairy leaves. Arnica is also known by the names mountain tobacco and, confusingly, leopard's bane and wolfsbane—two names that it shares with the entirely unrelated genus Aconitum.
This circumboreal and montane (subalpine) genus occurs mostly in the temperate regions of western North America, with a few species native to the Arctic regions of northern Eurasia and North America.
Arnica species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Bucculatrix arnicella.
Arnica was previously classified in the tribe Senecioneae because it has a flower or pappus of fine bristles.
Arnica is the basis of a homeopathic remedy promoted for aiding bruise recovery.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, moist environments reminiscent of its native subalpine meadows. It requires full to partial sun and consistently wet soil, making it suitable for bog gardens or areas with ample moisture. Moderate fertilization will support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from average to moderately rich, well-draining soil, typical of organic matter found in mountain meadows.
