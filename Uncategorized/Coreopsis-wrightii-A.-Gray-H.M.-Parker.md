## Care Guide
Rock Tickseed thrives in full sun and well-draining, rocky or lean soils, characteristic of its native open glades. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, performing best with minimal fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; prefers lean soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, if desired, is sufficient.
