## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, primarily the intermountain and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States (e.g., Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, California). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Semi-Arid Steppe/Montane, characterized by cold, often snowy winters and hot, dry summers. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving best in full sun conditions similar to open grasslands and woodlands. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry summers. Requires well-drained soil and infrequent watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.

## Care Guide
Bigroot Lomatium thrives in full sun and very well-drained soil, replicating its native semi-arid montane environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering and minimal fertilization once established, prioritizing excellent drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low nutrient needs, as it naturally grows in lean, often rocky soils. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, slow-release formula in spring, or not at all if soil is naturally fertile.
