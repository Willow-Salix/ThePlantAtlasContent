## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions of Florida (USA), Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean (e.g., Cuba, Bahamas). |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Coastal Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, accustomed to high light intensity and tolerant of bright, open exposures. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings; highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to sandy, well-drained coastal soils. |

## Introduction
Maytenus  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Celastraceae. Members of the genus are distributed throughout Central and South America, Southeast Asia, Micronesia, and Australasia, the Indian Ocean and Africa. They grow in a very wide variety of climates, from tropical to subpolar. The traditional circumscription of Maytenus was paraphyletic, so many species have been transferred to Denhamia and Gymnosporia.

## Care Guide
Florida Mayten thrives in full sun to partial shade, tolerating the bright coastal conditions of its native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering, and prefers well-drained soils with minimal fertilization. This makes it a resilient, low-maintenance plant ideal for xeriscaping or coastal gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; naturally thrives in poor to average, sandy or rocky soils and does not require heavy fertilization.
