## Care Guide
Jimbrush thrives in sunny, arid conditions typical of its native chaparral, requiring full sun and excellent drainage. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and should be watered very infrequently, with no need for fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Generally not required; native soils are typically low in nutrients, and excessive fertilization can be detrimental to plant health.
