## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (specifically the Mojave Desert region of California, Nevada, Arizona, and Utah) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily). This plant thrives in open, exposed desert environments. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant, adapted to very low natural precipitation. |

## Introduction
Camissonia, sometimes commonly known as sun cup or sundrop, is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the evening primrose family Onagraceae. A total of 12 species are known, nearly all from western North America, especially in the California Floristic Province, but also one from South America. Previous circumscriptions of the genus had recognized up to 62 species before it was split among other closely related genera.
The flowers generally open at dawn and are yellow. They are usually cup-shaped, thus the common name.
Formerly included in Oenothera, the species of Camissonia are distinguished by having a club- or head-shaped stigma, instead of the 4-part-divided stigma of Oenothera or Clarkia.
Camissonia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia cupes and Schinia deserticola, both of which feed on C. claviformis, the latter exclusively.
The genus is named after the botanist Adelbert von Chamisso.

## Care Guide
Baird's Suncup thrives in full sun and well-draining, poor soil, typical of its Mojave Desert origins. Water infrequently, ensuring the soil is dry between deep waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization to mimic its natural arid habitat.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy or gravelly desert soils.
