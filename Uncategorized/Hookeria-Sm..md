## Care Guide
Hookeria moss thrives in consistently moist, highly humid conditions with very low light, mimicking its native forest floor environment. Ensure excellent drainage and provide minimal to no fertilization for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is typically required. If desired, a very diluted liquid fertilizer formulated for mosses or epiphytes can be applied sparingly once a month during active growth.
