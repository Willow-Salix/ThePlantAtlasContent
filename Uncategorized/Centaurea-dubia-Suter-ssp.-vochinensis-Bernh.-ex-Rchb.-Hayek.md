## Care Guide
This plant thrives in temperate montane grassland conditions, preferring full to partial sun exposure. It requires moderate, consistent watering, though it can tolerate periods of drought once established, especially in well-drained soil. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it adapts well to average to poor soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring if soil is poor, but generally thrives in average soils without heavy feeding.
