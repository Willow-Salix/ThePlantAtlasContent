## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rare cactus thrives in conditions mimicking its native Chihuahuan Desert habitat, requiring full sun and very well-draining soil. It tolerates drought well, needing infrequent watering with almost no water during winter dormancy. Minimal fertilization is sufficient to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. A diluted, balanced succulent/cactus fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer).
