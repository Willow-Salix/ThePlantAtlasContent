## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Salmon River basin and surrounding regions in Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Montana, USA. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Sagebrush Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, thriving in open and exposed conditions similar to its native habitat on dry, rocky slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Low water needs; drought-tolerant once established. Requires infrequent watering, especially during dry periods, mimicking the natural sparse rainfall of its native arid climate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Salmon River Cryptantha thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, reflecting its native arid scrubland habitat. It requires infrequent watering, becoming drought-tolerant once established, and benefits from minimal to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Naturally grows in lean, often rocky soils, suggesting that rich fertilization is unnecessary and potentially detrimental.
