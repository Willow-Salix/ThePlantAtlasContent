# Prairie Goldenrod

*Oligoneuron album (Nutt.) G.L. Nesom* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern North America (USA and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) to thrive and produce abundant blooms, mimicking its open prairie habitat. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil during its active growth, especially when establishing. Once mature, it exhibits good drought tolerance, reflecting the variable rainfall of its native prairies. Water moderately, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. |

## Introduction
Prairie goldenrod is a common name for several plants and may refer to:

Solidago missouriensis, native to Canada, the United States, and northern Mexico
Solidago nemoralis, native to Canada and the United States

## Care Guide
Prairie goldenrod thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its native grassland environment. It requires moderate watering, becoming drought-tolerant once established, and benefits from minimal fertilization to prevent leggy growth. This hardy plant is well-suited for naturalized areas and meadows.

### Fertilizer
Requires minimal fertilization. In its native prairie environment, soil fertility is moderate. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring or a layer of compost is sufficient, especially in poorer soils. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to weak stems.
