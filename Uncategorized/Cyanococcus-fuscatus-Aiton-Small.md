## Introduction
Blueberries are a widely distributed and widespread group of perennial flowering plants with blue or purple berries. They are classified in the section Cyanococcus within the genus Vaccinium. Commercial blueberries—both wild (lowbush) and cultivated (highbush)—are all native to North America. The highbush varieties were introduced into Europe during the 1930s.
Blueberries are usually prostrate shrubs that can vary in size from 10 centimeters (4 inches) to 4 meters (13 feet) in height. In the commercial production of blueberries, the species with small, pea-size berries growing on low-level bushes is known as "lowbush blueberries" (synonymous with "wild"), while the species with larger berries growing on taller, cultivated bushes is known as "highbush blueberries". Canada is the leading producer of lowbush blueberries, while the United States produces some 29% of the world's supply of highbush blueberries.

## Care Guide
The Black Highbush Blueberry thrives in consistently moist, acidic soil and can tolerate full sun to partial shade. Ensure a regular and ample watering schedule to mimic its native wetland environment. Fertilize lightly with an acid-specific formula in spring to support healthy growth and fruit development.

### Fertilizer
Light; prefers acidic soil (pH 4.5-5.5). Use fertilizers formulated for acid-loving plants (e.g., rhododendron or azalea food) sparingly, typically once in spring.
