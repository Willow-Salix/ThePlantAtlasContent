## Introduction
Melilotus, known as melilot or sweet clover is a genus of legumes in the family Fabaceae, native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. The genus is closely related to Trifolium (clovers). Several species are common grassland plants and weeds of cultivated ground, and some species are now found worldwide as naturalised plants.
The scientific and English names both derive from Greek melílōtos from méli (honey), and lōtos (lotus), via Latin melilōtos and Old French mélilot. The alternative name "sweet clover" varies in orthography, also cited as sweet-clover and sweetclover. Other names include "kumoniga", from the Cumans.

## Care Guide
Sweetclover is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and moderate watering conditions, tolerating some drought. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, requiring little to no supplemental fertilizer and adapting well to various soil types.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed, especially nitrogen, as it is a legume capable of nitrogen fixation. Can tolerate poor to moderate soils.
