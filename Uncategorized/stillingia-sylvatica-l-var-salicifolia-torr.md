## 🧤 Care Instructions
Willowleaf Stillingia thrives in full sun to partial shade with moderate, well-drained watering, being quite drought-tolerant once established. It is adapted to lean, sandy soils, meaning heavy fertilization is usually unnecessary. Overall, it requires a relatively low-maintenance approach mimicking its natural, open, and somewhat dry native environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to relatively poor, sandy soils; excessive fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
