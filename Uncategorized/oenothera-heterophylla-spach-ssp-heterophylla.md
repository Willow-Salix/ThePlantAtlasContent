| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often in open, sandy fields, clearings, or disturbed areas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) to partial sun (4-6 hours direct sunlight), reflecting its preference for open, exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate watering; keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during dry spells. Once established, it exhibits good drought tolerance, typical of plants found in sandy soils within its native humid subtropical climate. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Variableleaf Evening Primrose prefers full to partial sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native open, sandy habitats in the humid subtropical southeastern US. Water moderately to keep the soil moist, but avoid overwatering as it tolerates drought once established and has low fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. An annual application of a light, balanced fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, or none at all if soil is moderately fertile.
