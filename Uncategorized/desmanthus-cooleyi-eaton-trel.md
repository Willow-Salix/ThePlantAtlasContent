## 🌱 Overview
Desmanthus is a genus of flowering plants in the mimosoid clade of the subfamily Caesalpinioideae of the pea family, Fabaceae. The name is derived from the Greek words δεσμός (desmos), meaning "bundle", and ἄνθος (anthos), meaning "flower". It contains about 24 species of herbs and shrubs that are sometimes described as being suffruticose and have bipinnate leaves. Desmanthus is closely related to Leucaena and in appearance is similar to Neptunia. Like Mimosa and Neptunia, Desmanthus species fold their leaves in the evening. They are native to Mexico and North, Central and South America.  Members of the genus are commonly known as bundleflowers.  Donkey beans is another common name and originated in Central America, where Desmanthus species are highly regarded as fodder for these domestic draught animals.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cooley's Bundleflower thrives in full sun exposure and well-draining soil, mimicking its native prairie habitat. This resilient plant is highly drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal to no supplemental fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; as a legume (Fabaceae), it fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil itself.
