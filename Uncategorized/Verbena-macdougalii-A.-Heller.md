## Introduction
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## Care Guide
MacDougal Verbena is a hardy, drought-tolerant perennial ideal for full sun exposure in dry montane climates. It requires well-draining soil and infrequent watering once established, performing best with minimal fertilization. This low-maintenance plant thrives in conditions mimicking its arid native environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adaptable to lean to average soil fertility. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring may benefit growth, but heavy feeding is not necessary.
