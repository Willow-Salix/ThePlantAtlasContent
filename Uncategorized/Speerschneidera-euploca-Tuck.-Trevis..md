# Speerschneidera Lichen

*Speerschneidera euploca (Tuck.) Trevis.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America, particularly the Pacific Northwest and Appalachian regions |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect or filtered light; avoid direct, intense sunlight which can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and consistent moisture are crucial. Regular misting, fogging, or placement in a humid environment (like a terrarium) is necessary, as lichens absorb water directly from the air and not through roots. |

## Introduction
Speerschneidera is a single-species genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Leprocaulaceae. The genus was circumscribed by Italian botanist Vittore Benedetto Antonio Trevisan de Saint-Léon in 1861, with Speerschneidera euploca as the type species. This lichen was originally described by Edward Tuckerman in 1858 as Physcia euploca. It is a crustose lichen found in the southern United States and Mexico.
The genus name Speerschneidera honours German doctor, teacher and naturalist Julius Ferdinand Speerschneider (1825–1903). He worked as a curator of Frederick Charles, Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt's natural history collection which later became the Natural History Museum in Rudolstadt.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light, mimicking its native temperate rainforest habitat. It requires high atmospheric moisture and should be hydrated through misting or consistent humidity, rather than traditional watering. Avoid traditional fertilizers, as it absorbs nutrients from the air and is sensitive to pollutants.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens are highly sensitive to atmospheric pollutants and excess nutrients, absorbing what they need from the air and substrate.
