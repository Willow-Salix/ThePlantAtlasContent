## Care Guide
The Dawnflower thrives in a humid subtropical environment, preferring full sun and well-drained, consistently moist soil. Fertilize lightly during the growing season to encourage robust growth and abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization. Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly during the active growing season, as overly rich soil can reduce flowering.
