## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between applications. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its native habitat's lean soils. Its drought tolerance makes it an excellent choice for xeriscape or arid gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilizer needs. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring, or none at all in nutrient-rich soil, is sufficient.
