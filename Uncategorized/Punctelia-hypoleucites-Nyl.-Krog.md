## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of North America (especially eastern U.S. and Mexico), Europe, and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate Forest (e.g., Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forest) |
| **Sunlight** | Dappled sunlight or partial shade. Thrives in moderate light conditions, protected from intense, direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires high ambient humidity and regular moisture from rainfall, fog, or dew. Does not absorb water from soil and should not be 'watered' conventionally. |

## Introduction
Punctelia is a genus of foliose lichens belonging to the large family Parmeliaceae. The genus, which contains about 50 species, was segregated from genus Parmelia in 1982. Characteristics that define Punctelia include the presence of hook-like to thread-like conidia (asexual spores), simple rhizines (root-like structures that attach the lichen thallus to its substrate), and point-like pseudocyphellae (tiny pores on the thallus surface that facilitate gas exchange). It is this last feature that is alluded to in the vernacular names speckled shield lichens or speckleback lichens.
Punctelia lichens grow on bark, wood, and rocks. The genus has a worldwide distribution, occurring on all continents but Antarctica. Species are found in temperate to subtropical locations. Punctelia has centres of distribution in the Neotropics and Africa; about half of the known species occur in South America. The photobiont partners of Punctelia are green algae in the genus Trebouxia. Some pollution-sensitive Punctelia species have been proposed for use as bioindicators of air pollution.

## Care Guide
Punctelia hypoleucites is a lichen that thrives in humid, temperate environments with dappled sunlight, often found on tree bark. Its 'care' focuses on maintaining high atmospheric humidity and good air quality, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and rain, without needing soil, traditional watering, or fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
None; this lichen obtains all necessary nutrients directly from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust, gases) and its substrate.
