## Care Guide
Tufted Hair-grass flourishes in cool, moist environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. It demands consistently wet soil, tolerating periods of waterlogging, and has low to moderate fertilization needs, with a light annual feeding often sufficient.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Typically benefits from a light, balanced fertilizer application once a year in spring, especially if grown in poor or nutrient-depleted soils.
