## Care Guide
Calenia aspidotum is a tropical epiphytic lichen that necessitates high humidity and low to moderate indirect light. Emulate its humid forest environment with frequent moisture and excellent air circulation, avoiding direct sun and traditional fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer is required. Lichens primarily absorb nutrients from atmospheric deposition, rainwater, and their substrate; conventional fertilization methods are not applicable and can be detrimental.
