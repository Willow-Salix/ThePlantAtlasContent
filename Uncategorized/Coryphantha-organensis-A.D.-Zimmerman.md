## Introduction
Coryphantha (from Greek, "flowering on the top"), or beehive cactus, is a genus of small to middle-sized, globose or columnar cacti. The genus is native to arid parts of Central America, Mexico, through Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas and north into southwestern, central, and southeastern Montana. With its two subgenera, 57 species and 20 subspecies, it is one of the largest genera of cactus.

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives on neglect, requiring conditions that mimic its native arid environment. Provide abundant direct sunlight and ensure excellent drainage, watering only when the soil is thoroughly dry. Minimal fertilization is needed, primarily during its active growth phase, to support its health.

### Fertilizer
Low. Fertilize once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer) with a diluted, balanced cactus-specific fertilizer.
