## Care Guide
This hardy moss thrives in bright, indirect to partial sun and is highly tolerant of drought, preferring to dry out completely between occasional thorough wettings. It has very low nutrient needs and generally requires no fertilization, making it a low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Very low; rarely needed as mosses absorb nutrients from air and rainfall.
