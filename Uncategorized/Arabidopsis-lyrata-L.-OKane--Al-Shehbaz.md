## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (Eastern and Central United States, Great Lakes Region) and Europe (Scandinavia, parts of Central Europe) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodlands, Rocky Outcrops, and Subalpine areas |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it grows in open areas, clearings, and rocky slopes, indicating a need for good light exposure but can tolerate some afternoon shade. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate and consistent moisture, especially during dry periods, but excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot. Mimics its native growth on well-drained rocky or sandy soils. |

## Introduction
Arabidopsis (rockcress) is a genus of small flowering plants in the cabbage and mustard family, Brassicaceae. Arabidopsis species are native to temperate and subarctic Eurasia and North America, North Africa, and the mountains of eastern tropical Africa. This genus is of great interest since it contains thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), one of the model organisms used for studying plant biology and the first plant to have its entire genome sequenced. Changes in thale cress are easily observed, making it a very useful model.

## Care Guide
Lyre-leaved Rockcress thrives in cool, temperate conditions with ample sunlight or partial shade and well-drained soil. It requires moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It often grows in naturally lean or rocky soils, so excessive fertilization is not necessary. A balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is usually sufficient.
