## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (including US states such as Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Colorado, Utah, and parts of neighboring states) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Steppe and Semi-Arid Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Infrequent, deep watering is preferred during extended dry periods, but generally low water needs. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Low Fleabane requires conditions similar to its native dry, open habitats in western North America. Provide full sun and well-draining soil, allowing it to dry out between infrequent waterings due to its drought tolerance. Fertilization is rarely needed as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils and typically does not require regular fertilization.
