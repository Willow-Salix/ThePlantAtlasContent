## 🧤 Care Instructions
Eelgrass is a marine aquatic plant requiring continuous submersion in temperate saline or brackish water. It needs moderate to high light penetration through the water column and derives nutrients from its rooted substrate in nutrient-rich marine sediments. Maintaining water quality and appropriate temperature is crucial for its survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in nutrient-rich marine sediments, such as sandy or muddy substrates, which provide essential nutrients through the roots.
