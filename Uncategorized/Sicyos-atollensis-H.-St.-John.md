## Care Guide
This rare Hawaiian atoll plant requires full sun and consistent, but not excessive, watering in well-draining soil. Due to its native sandy, nutrient-poor environment, light fertilization is sufficient to support its growth and maintain its health.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula, as atoll soils are naturally nutrient-poor and sandy.
