## Introduction
Chrysosplenium (golden saxifrage or golden-saxifrage) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Saxifragaceae. It includes 84 species found throughout the Arctic and northern temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere. The highest species diversity is in eastern Asia, and some species are found disjunctly in South America.
They are soft herbaceous perennial plants growing to 20 centimeters (8 in) tall, typically in wet, shady locations in forests. The leaves are rounded, palmately veined, with a lobed margin and arranged either alternately or opposite, depending on the species. The flowers are small, yellow or yellowish-green, with four petals; they are produced in small clusters at the apex of the shoots surrounded by leafy bracts. Most of the growth and flowering is in early spring, when more light is available under deciduous trees.

## Care Guide
Rosendahl's Golden Saxifrage thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded conditions, reflecting its subarctic woodland origins. It requires constant soil moisture and protection from direct sun. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to nutrient-poor soils, so a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season is sufficient.
