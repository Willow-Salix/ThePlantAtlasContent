## Care Guide
To mimic its tropical rainforest origin, Odontosoria scandens requires consistently moist soil, high humidity, and low to moderate indirect light. Protect it from direct sun and feed lightly during warmer months to encourage healthy growth, ensuring good drainage.

### Fertilizer
Feed sparingly with a half-strength, balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring to summer). Reduce or cease feeding in winter.
