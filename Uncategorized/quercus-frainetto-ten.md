## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern Europe (Balkan Peninsula, Southern Italy) and Anatolia (Turkey) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Forest and Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and health, as it typically grows in open woodlands. |
| **💧 Water** | Young trees require moderate, consistent watering, especially during dry periods, to establish their root system. Mature trees are highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering and relying mostly on natural rainfall, reflecting their adaptation to hot, dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Quercus pubescens (synonyms virgiliana), commonly known as the downy oak, pubescent oak or Italian oak, is a species of white oak (genus Quercus sect.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Italian Oak thrives in full sun, reflecting its natural habitat in open woodlands. Once established, it is remarkably drought-tolerant, requiring minimal supplemental watering beyond natural rainfall. Fertilization is generally low-demand for mature specimens, focusing more on healthy soil structure.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Established trees generally do not require regular fertilization in suitable soils. Young trees may benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season to aid establishment.
