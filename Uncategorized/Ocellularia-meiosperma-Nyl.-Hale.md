## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical regions of South America (e.g., Brazil, Guyana) and Southeast Asia (e.g., Thailand, India). |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Humid Subtropical Forests. |
| **Sunlight** | Low to indirect light, protected from direct harsh sun, typical of understory conditions on tree bark. |
| **Watering** | High humidity (70-90%) is crucial, with frequent misting or ambient moisture absorption from the air. Avoid prolonged dryness, but also ensure good air circulation. |

## Care Guide
This corticolous lichen requires high humidity and indirect light, mimicking its native tropical forest habitat. Regular moisture absorption from the air is essential, but traditional fertilization is unnecessary and potentially detrimental.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Lichens derive nutrients from the air and rain; added fertilizer can be harmful.
