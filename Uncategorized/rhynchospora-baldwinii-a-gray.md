## 🌱 Overview
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Baldwin's Beaksedge thrives in full to partial sun with consistently wet to saturated soil conditions, mimicking its native bog and wet savanna habitats. It requires ample moisture and should never be allowed to dry out, while benefiting from low to moderate fertilization during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Use a balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly during the growing season, or a slow-release wetland plant formula, as it grows in typically nutrient-poor soils.
