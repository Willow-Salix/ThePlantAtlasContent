## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cold-hardy grass needs bright light and consistently moist, well-drained soil, typical of its alpine and arctic tundra origins. Fertilization should be minimal, if any, to prevent over-enrichment in its naturally nutrient-poor environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, as it thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky, and thin tundra soils.
