## Introduction
Thinopyrum intermedium, known commonly as intermediate wheatgrass, is a sod-forming perennial grass in the Triticeae tribe of Pooideae native to Europe and Western Asia. It is part of a group of plants commonly called wheatgrasses because of the similarity of their seed heads or ears to common wheat. However, wheatgrasses generally are perennial, while wheat is an annual.
Trials with intermediate wheatgrass, the product of which is trademarked by the Land Institute as "Kernza", show that it can be grown as a "multi-functional" crop, yielding various commodities as well as ecosystem services.  Whereas annuals such as corn tend to deplete soil organic matter and require inputs, a perennial grain such as intermediate wheatgrass can yield crops while building soil organic matter.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its origins in temperate grasslands. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring only moderate watering, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not a heavy feeder and can thrive in moderately fertile soils without much supplemental fertilization.
