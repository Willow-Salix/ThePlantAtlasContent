## 🧤 Care Instructions
Phaeographis punctiformis is a tropical lichen that thrives in conditions mimicking its native rainforest habitat. Provide high humidity through frequent misting and ensure consistent moisture for its substrate, avoiding direct sun exposure. No traditional fertilization is necessary as it obtains nutrients atmospherically.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer required. Lichens absorb nutrients primarily from the air, rain, and the substrate they grow on.
