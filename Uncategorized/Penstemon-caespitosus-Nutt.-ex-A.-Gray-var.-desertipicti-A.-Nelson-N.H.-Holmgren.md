## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (specifically the Intermountain West, including Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, replicating its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; extremely drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in winter. Overwatering is detrimental. |

## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
Mat Penstemon requires conditions mimicking its native arid desert environment, meaning full sun and very infrequent watering. It thrives in lean, well-draining soil and does not need regular fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required. Thrives in lean, well-draining soils and does not tolerate rich or heavy feeding.
