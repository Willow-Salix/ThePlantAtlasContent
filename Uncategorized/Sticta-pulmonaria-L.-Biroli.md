## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate and Boreal Forests (cool, humid regions with regular precipitation) |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to partial shade, mimicking its natural habitat beneath a forest canopy. Avoid direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and regular moisture from misting or precipitation, as it absorbs water and nutrients from the air and rain. Do not water like a typical potted plant. |

## Introduction
Sticta is a genus of lichens in the family Peltigeraceae. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in tropical areas, and includes about 114 species. These lichens have a leafy appearance, and are colored brown or black. Sticta species with cyanobacteria as photobionts can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, and due to their relative abundance and high turnover, they contribute appreciably to the rainforest ecosystem. They are commonly called spotted felt lichens.

## Care Guide
As an epiphytic lichen from temperate and boreal forests, this organism requires high atmospheric humidity and indirect light to thrive. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and precipitation, making a clean, consistently moist environment crucial for its survival rather than soil-based care.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers. Its nutrient uptake is primarily from atmospheric deposition; a clean, pollution-free environment is paramount.
