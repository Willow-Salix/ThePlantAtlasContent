## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (endemic) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Avoid harsh, direct afternoon sun, which can scorch the leaves, mimicking its natural understory or forest edge habitat. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture. Keep the soil continuously moist but not waterlogged, allowing the top inch to slightly dry between waterings. High humidity is also beneficial. |

## Introduction
Dubautia or na'ena'e is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. The genus was named after Joseph Eugène DuBaut (1796–1832), an officer in the French Navy who participated in Freycinet's expedition.
The entire genus is endemic to Hawaii. It contains more species than the other two genera in the silversword alliance, including cushion plants, shrubs, trees, and lianas.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Na'ena'e Pua Melemele requires consistent soil moisture and high humidity, mimicking its native Hawaiian wet forest environment. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade, protecting it from intense direct sun. Fertilize lightly to moderately during active growth to support its natural development.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Use a balanced, slow-release or diluted liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer), as native forest soils provide steady but not excessively rich nutrients.
