## 🌱 Overview
Pears are fruits produced and consumed around the world, growing on a tree and are harvested in late summer into mid-autumn. The pear tree and shrub are a species of genus Pyrus , in the family Rosaceae, bearing the pomaceous fruit of the same name. Several species of pears are valued for their edible fruit and juices, while others are cultivated as trees.
The tree is medium-sized and native to coastal and mildly temperate regions of Europe, North Africa, and Asia. Pear wood is one of the preferred materials in the manufacture of high-quality woodwind instruments and furniture.
About 3,000 known varieties of pears are grown worldwide, which vary in both shape and taste. The fruit is consumed fresh, canned, as juice, dried, or fermented as perry.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Chinese Pears thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring their native temperate East Asian habitat. They require consistent watering throughout the growing season, especially when setting fruit, and benefit from regular fertilization to ensure robust growth and a bountiful harvest.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high, particularly during active growth and fruiting, as temperate fruit trees require ample nutrients from fertile forest soils for optimal production. Annual application of a balanced fertilizer is beneficial.
