## Introduction
Fimbristylis is a genus of sedges. A plant in this genus may be known commonly as a fimbry or   fimbristyle. There are over 300 species distributed worldwide. Several continents have native species but many species have been introduced to regions where they are not native. Some are considered weeds. These are typical sedges in appearance, with stiff, ridged stems and cone-shaped terminal panicles of spikelets. They are found in wet environments, and are most diverse in tropical and subtropical regions.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native wetland habitats. Fertilization needs are low, making it a relatively easy plant to care for in appropriate conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; use a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once or twice during the growing season, or incorporate slow-release granular.
