## Care Guide
This plant thrives in partial to full shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. As a woodland native, it prefers soil rich in organic matter and is relatively low-maintenance, becoming somewhat drought-tolerant once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from soil enriched with organic matter rather than heavy fertilization.
