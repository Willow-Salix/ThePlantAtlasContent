## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western Europe (e.g., British Isles, Scandinavia), Eastern North America, Pacific Northwest |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate Forest (Oceanic/Wet Temperate) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate, indirect light. As a moss growing on tree trunks or rocks in temperate forests, it generally receives filtered or dappled sunlight. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and consistently moist conditions are crucial. Mimic its native environment with regular misting or placement in a terrarium to prevent drying out; it absorbs water directly from the environment. |

## Introduction
Ulota is a genus of mosses comprising 69 species with a worldwide distribution, though most species are found in the southern hemisphere.
They have commonly been grouped within the genus Orthotrichum, though recently they have been placed in their own genus. Their phylogeny and taxonomy have been an area of debate ever since they were placed in their own genus, though it has been largely accepted to place Ulota as a genus of their own. They can be found growing on trees close to the coast, though some species are also found on rocks. Their shoots form small tufts to large mats across habitats, often intertwined with other mosses, including Orthotrichum species.
Ulota reproduce using sexual structures, sporangium (plural: sporangia), that are terminal on the shoot. The calyptra covering the developing sporangium can be hairy or not hairy depending on the species, but the hairs extend from the sporangium base to the apex as opposed to the calyptra hairs of Polytrichum mosses which extend from the apex to the base.

## Care Guide
Ulota moss thrives in a consistently humid and moist environment with low to moderate indirect light, replicating its temperate forest origins. Ensure it never dries out completely and avoid using strong fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. Mosses are adapted to nutrient-poor environments and absorb nutrients from rainwater and atmospheric deposits; over-fertilization can be harmful.
