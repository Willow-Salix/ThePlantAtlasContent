## Introduction
Plantago is a genus of about 200 species of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae, commonly called plantains or fleaworts. The common name plantain is shared with the unrelated cooking plantain. Most are herbaceous plants, though a few are subshrubs growing to 60 centimetres (24 inches) tall.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Maui Plantain needs abundant light, ranging from full sun to partial shade, and a continuously wet or saturated soil environment. Mimicking its high-elevation bogland origin, provide consistent moisture and apply a low-strength, balanced fertilizer only during periods of active growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the active growing season, as bog plants often adapt to nutrient-poor environments.
