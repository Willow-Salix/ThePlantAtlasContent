| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade, especially afternoon shade; thrives in dappled sunlight mimicking forest understory conditions. |

## Introduction
Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), also called orangeroot or yellow puccoon, is a perennial herb in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae, native to North America. It may be distinguished by its thick, yellow knotted rootstock. The stem is purplish and hairy above ground and yellow below ground where it connects to the yellow rhizome. Goldenseal reproduces both clonally through the rhizome and sexually, with clonal division more frequent than asexual reproduction. It takes between 4 and 5 years for a plant to reach sexual maturity, i.e. the point at which it produces flowers. Plants in the first stage, when the seed erupts and cotyledons emerge, can remain in this state one or more years. The second vegetative stage occurs during years two and three (and sometimes longer) and is characterized by the development of a single leaf and absence of a well developed stem. Finally, the third stage is reproductive, at which point flowering and fruiting occurs. This last stage takes between 4 and 5 years to develop.
A second species from Japan, previously listed as Hydrastis palmatum, is now usually classified in another genus, as Glaucidium palmatum.

## Care Guide
Goldenseal thrives in cool, shaded woodland conditions, mirroring its native understory habitat. It requires consistently moist, organically rich, and well-draining soil, with regular watering to prevent drying out. Provide dappled light to avoid scorching its leaves.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; prefers organically rich soil. Annually amend with compost or a slow-release organic fertilizer in spring.
