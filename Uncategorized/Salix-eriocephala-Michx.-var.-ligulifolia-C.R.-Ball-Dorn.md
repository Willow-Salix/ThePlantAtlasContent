## Introduction
Salix cordata, the sand dune willow, furry willow, or heartleaf willow, is a perennial shrub that grows 3 to 12 feet (0.91 to 3.66 m) tall; plants taller than 6 feet (1.8 m) are rare. The plant is native to the northeast regions of the North American continent; it is found on sand dunes, river banks, and lake shores in sandy, silty or gravelly soils.

## Care Guide
The Heartleaf Willow thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, replicating its natural riparian environment. Provide moderate fertilization to support its robust growth. This plant is well-suited for wet areas or near water features.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from an annual application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer, particularly if planted in nutrient-poor soil or a container.
