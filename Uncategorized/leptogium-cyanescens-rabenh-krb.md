## 🌱 Overview
Leptogium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Collemataceae. It has about 110 species. Species formerly classified under Leptogium have since been divided among the genera Leptogium, Pseudoleptogium, and Scytinium.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Skin lichen thrives in environments with very high humidity and low, indirect light, mimicking its native forest understory habitat. It does not require traditional fertilization and is sensitive to dry conditions, necessitating consistent moisture and atmospheric humidity.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens absorb trace nutrients from the air and rain; excess nutrients can be detrimental.
