# Philoxerus
### *Philoxerus R. Br.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal regions across tropical and subtropical areas worldwide, including Australia, Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Americas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Coastal (e.g., beaches, dunes, salt marshes) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure, consistent with its open coastal habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering, keeping soil consistently moist but well-draining. Tolerant of some drought once established, but thrives with consistent moisture. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Philoxerus thrives in full sun, reflecting its tropical and subtropical coastal origins. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil, though it can tolerate some drought once established. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its adaptation to often nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements, as its native sandy or saline soils are typically not nutrient-rich. Minimal light feeding during the growing season is sufficient if desired.
