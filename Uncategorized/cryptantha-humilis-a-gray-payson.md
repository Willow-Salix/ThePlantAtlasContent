## 🌱 Overview
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Roundspike Cryptantha thrives in full sun and requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between applications. It prefers lean, well-draining soil and typically needs minimal to no fertilization, mirroring its native arid scrubland habitat. The primary focus should be on avoiding overwatering and providing ample light.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils and generally requires minimal to no fertilization.
