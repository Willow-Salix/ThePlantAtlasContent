## Introduction
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.

## Care Guide
This biscuitroot is well-suited to dry, sunny environments, mirroring its native Mediterranean chaparral habitat. It requires excellent drainage, minimal summer water once established, and does not need rich soil or frequent fertilization. Provide full sun and allow the soil to dry out between waterings, especially in summer.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; thrives in lean, well-draining, and poor to moderately fertile soils.
