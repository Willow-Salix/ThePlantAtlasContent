## 🧤 Care Instructions
Burrobrush requires full sun exposure and extremely well-draining soil, replicating its native arid habitats. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between applications, and avoid over-fertilization as it thrives in poor nutrient conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Thrives in poor, nutrient-deficient soils typical of desert environments. Fertilization is generally not necessary.
