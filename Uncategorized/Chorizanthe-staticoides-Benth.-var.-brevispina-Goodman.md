## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (Central Coast, Southern Coast Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires high exposure to direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Very low; highly drought-tolerant, preferring dry conditions. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in established plants. |

## Introduction
Chorizanthe is a genus of plants in the buckwheat family known generally as spineflowers. These are small, squat, herbaceous plants with spiny-looking inflorescences of flowers. The flowers may be in shades of red or yellow to white. The bracts are pointed and sometimes tipped with a hooked awn, and the inflorescence often dries into a rounded, spiny husk. Spineflowers are found in western North America and South America.
Name derivation: The word Chorizanthe comes from the Greek roots chorizo and anthos meaning "to divide," and "flower," thus meaning "divided flowers," but actually used in reference to the divided calyx.

## Care Guide
This California native thrives in full sun and dry conditions, mirroring its Mediterranean shrubland origin. It requires minimal watering once established and prefers lean, well-draining soils without the need for supplemental fertilizer. Emphasize drought tolerance and avoid overwatering.

### Fertilizer
Very low; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
