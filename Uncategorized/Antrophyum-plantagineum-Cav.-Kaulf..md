## Care Guide
This tropical fern thrives in high humidity and consistent moisture, requiring its substrate to be kept moist but never soggy. Provide low to medium, indirect light to mimic its native rainforest understory environment. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted solution during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding. Use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) every 2-4 weeks during the growing season; minimal or no fertilizer during dormancy.
