## Introduction
Ischaemum is a genus in the tribe Andropogoneae, belonging to the grass family, widespread in tropical and semitropical regions in many countries. Many species are known commonly as murainagrass.
In 2022, Shahid Nawaz (an agrostologist, The Blatter Herbarium (BLAT)) described an unusual species in the genus characterised by its dioecious breeding system, it was named as Ischaemum dioecum Landge & R.D. Shinde. This species is endemic to a couple of locations in Western Ghats of Raigad district, Maharashtra, India. The male and female plants are sexually separate individuals and occupy similar ecological niches. This is the only dioecious species in the tribe Andropogoneae.

## Care Guide
Seashore Centipede Grass is best grown in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native coastal environment. It is a low-maintenance grass requiring minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to sandy, less fertile conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs, as it is adapted to the often nutrient-poor sandy soils of coastal environments.
