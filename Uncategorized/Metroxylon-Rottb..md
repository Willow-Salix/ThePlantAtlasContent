## Introduction
Sago palm is a common name for several plants which are used to produce a starchy food known as sago. Sago palms may be "true palms" in the family Arecaceae, or cycads with a palm-like appearance. Sago produced from cycads must be detoxified before consumption. Plants called sago palm include:

Metroxylon (true sago palms), a genus in the palm family (Arecaceae) native to Southeast Asia
Cycads
Cycas revoluta, (king sago palm), native to Japan and widely cultivated as an ornamental plant
Cycas rumphii, (queen sago palm), native to southeast Asia
Cycas circinalis, (queen sago palm), native to India

## Care Guide
This tropical palm thrives in consistently moist soil and high humidity, mimicking its native swampy rainforest environment. Provide bright indirect to partial sun, protecting it from intense afternoon light, and feed regularly during its active growth period to support its vigorous nature.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize regularly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, slow-release palm fertilizer.
