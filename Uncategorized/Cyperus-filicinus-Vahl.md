## Care Guide
This wetland species thrives in consistently saturated or boggy soil, mimicking its native tropical marsh habitats. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil never dries out, along with regular, diluted fertilization during growth periods.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization during its active growing season. As wetland soils can be rich, a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength monthly would be suitable.
