## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (specifically California and Oregon, USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean climate (chaparral and temperate grasslands with dry summers and wet winters) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its growth in open, exposed habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal water during dry periods. Water more frequently during its active growing season in spring, ensuring well-drained conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lupinus bicolor is a species of lupine known as the miniature lupine, Lindley's annual lupine, pigmy-leaved lupine, or bicolor lupine.
It is a showy flowering annual or perennial plant native to western North America, from northwestern Baja California, throughout California, and north to British Columbia. It is found in diverse habitats below 3,000 feet (910 m), including: grasslands; chaparral; oak, mixed conifer and Joshua tree woodlands; coastal sage scrub; and open conifer forests. It often shares habitats with other prolifically blooming spring and early summer wildflowers, including the California poppy.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Miniature Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal watering. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it needs little to no fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for appropriate climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and thrives in nutrient-poor, well-draining soils. Excess fertilizer, especially nitrogen, can inhibit flowering.
