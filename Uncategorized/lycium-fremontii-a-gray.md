## 🧤 Care Instructions
Provide this plant with full, intense sun exposure and water infrequently, allowing for complete soil dryness between irrigation. Given its desert origins, it thrives in lean, well-draining soil with very minimal fertilizer supplementation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer needed; native to nutrient-poor desert soils, a light annual application in spring is sufficient, or none at all if growth is vigorous.
