| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mountainous regions of central China (Gansu, Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Shade (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sun for optimal flowering, tolerates some afternoon shade in hot climates) |
| **Watering** | Regular watering is needed during establishment and extended dry periods. Once mature, it is moderately drought tolerant and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Syringa is a genus of 12 currently recognized species of flowering woody plants in the olive family or Oleaceae called lilacs. These lilacs are native to woodland and scrub from southeastern Europe to eastern Asia, and widely and commonly cultivated in temperate areas elsewhere.
The genus is most closely related to Ligustrum (privet), classified with it in Oleaceae tribus Oleeae subtribus Ligustrinae.
Lilacs are used as food plants by the larvae of some moth species, including lilac leaf mining moth, privet hawk moth, copper underwing, scalloped oak and Svensson's copper underwing.

## Care Guide
Komarov's Lilac thrives in temperate climates, preferring full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Provide regular water during its initial establishment and during dry spells, but allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize moderately in spring for best growth and bloom.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost application in early spring is beneficial, especially in nutrient-poor soils. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
