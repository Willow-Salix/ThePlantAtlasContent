## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including mountainous regions of the United States (e.g., California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Colorado) and parts of Canada. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane, characterized by seasonal moisture (often from snowmelt), wet meadows, and vernal pool environments, experiencing distinct wet and dry periods. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; requires bright, direct light for optimal growth, typically found in open areas. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil during its active growth period, mimicking vernal pool conditions; tolerant of temporary inundation but will also experience dry periods as conditions change. |

## Introduction
The genus Myosurus, or mousetail,  belongs to the family Ranunculaceae. It comprises about 15 species of annual scapose herbs.  These herbs are nearly cosmopolitan (lacking in eastern Asia and tropical regions), with a center of diversity in western North America. The flowers are easily recognised by bearing 6 stamens with numerous ovaries on a stalk (accounting for the name "mousetail").
Selected species:

Myosurus apetalus - bristly mousetail
Myosurus cupulatus - Arizona mousetail
Myosurus minimus - tiny mousetail
Myosurus nitidus - western mousetail
Myosurus sessilis - vernal pool mousetail

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright, direct sunlight and requires a unique watering regimen, mimicking its native vernal pool habitat with periods of saturation followed by drying. Provide consistently moist to wet soil during its active growth phase, and offer light fertilization to support its development in temperate montane conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs; a light application of balanced fertilizer or compost once during the growing season is sufficient, or may not require any in naturally fertile soils.
