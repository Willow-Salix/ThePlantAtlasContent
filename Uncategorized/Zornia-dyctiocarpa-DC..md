## Care Guide
Zornia dyctiocarpa thrives in conditions mimicking its native South American savannas, preferring full to partial sun and well-draining soil. It requires regular watering during its active growth but can tolerate short dry spells. Moderate fertilization will support its vigorous growth throughout the season.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so a balanced or slightly lower nitrogen fertilizer is suitable for healthy growth in typical grassland soils.
