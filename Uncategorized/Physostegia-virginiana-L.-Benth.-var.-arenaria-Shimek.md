## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern North America, particularly in sandy prairies, floodplains, and along rivers in states like Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Riparian Zones |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun to partial shade, thriving in open, well-lit environments where it is exposed to direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate to high watering to maintain consistently moist soil, especially given its preference for well-draining sandy soils, mimicking its native habitat near water sources but in porous soil. |

## Introduction
Physostegia, the lionshearts or false dragonheads  (in reference to their similarity to Dracocephalum), is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae, native to North America (United States, Canada, northern Mexico). They are erect rhizomatous herbaceous perennials inhabiting damp, sunny places. 
They grow up to 2 m (7 ft) tall with purple or pink tubular flowers in racemes in summer.
The generic name comes from two Greek words, physa (a bladder) and stege (a covering), referring to the calyx, which becomes full of fruit when mature.
Physostegia virginiana is the most common species, and is known as "obedient plant".

## Care Guide
The Sand Obedient Plant thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring consistently moist yet well-drained sandy soils, characteristic of its native grassland and riparian habitats. It tolerates average soil fertility and benefits from regular watering, particularly during dry spells, to support its robust growth without demanding excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Tolerates average to lean soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial in very poor, sandy soils.
