## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern Brazil |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Atlantic Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect to full sun. While it can tolerate some partial shade, at least 6 hours of direct sun is ideal for optimal growth and fruit production. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage; do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during warm growing months. Reduce frequency slightly in cooler, dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Eugenia is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family Myrtaceae. It has a worldwide, although highly uneven, distribution in tropical and subtropical regions. The bulk of the approximately 1,100 species occur in the New World tropics, especially in the eastern Brazil's northern Andes, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Forest (coastal forests). Other centers of diversity include New Caledonia and Madagascar. Many species in the Old World have received a new classification into the genus Syzygium.
All species are woody evergreen trees and shrubs. Several are grown as ornamental plants for their attractive glossy foliage, and a few produce edible fruit that are eaten fresh or used in jams and jellies.

## Care Guide
This tropical plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native Brazilian Atlantic Forest, requiring bright light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Regular fertilization during the growing season will support its robust growth and abundant fruit production, making it a rewarding plant for warm, humid environments.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize regularly during the growing season (spring through fall) with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Reduce or cease fertilization during winter.
