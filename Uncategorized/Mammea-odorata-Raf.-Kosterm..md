## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia and Pacific Islands (Philippines, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, etc.) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Shade to Full Sun. While young plants may tolerate some shade in their native forest understory, mature trees require significant light for optimal growth and fruiting. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil. Requires frequent and abundant watering, especially during dry periods, mimicking the high rainfall of its native habitat. High humidity is also beneficial. |

## Introduction
Mammea is a flowering plant genus with about 70 species in the family Calophyllaceae. Its members are evergreen trees having edible fruits. The plants are dioecious, i.e. each individual plant produces either male or female flowers only. The calyx is fully fused initially, splitting into two or three valvate sepals. There are four to eight petals. Berries are formed, containing one to four seeds. The leaves are rigid, coriaceous and often have pellucid dots.

## Care Guide
Native to tropical rainforests, Mammea odorata thrives in warm, humid environments with consistently moist, fertile soil. Provide partial shade to full sun and ensure regular watering and feeding, especially during periods of active growth, to encourage robust health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high fertility. Benefits from regular feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season to support its vigorous growth.
