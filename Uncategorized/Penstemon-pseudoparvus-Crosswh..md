## Introduction
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native high-elevation habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Thrives in lean, rocky soils. An annual light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if desired, but often not necessary.
