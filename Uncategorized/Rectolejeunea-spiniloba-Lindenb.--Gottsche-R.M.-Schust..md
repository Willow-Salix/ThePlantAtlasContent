## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America (Neotropics) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light; thrives in shaded or dappled light conditions, avoid direct harsh sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged; high ambient humidity is crucial. Benefits from frequent misting or placement in a humid environment like a terrarium. |

## Care Guide
This epiphytic bryophyte thrives in consistently high humidity and low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native tropical rainforest understory. Maintain continuous moisture in the substrate without waterlogging, and ensure excellent air circulation. Fertilizer needs are minimal, requiring only highly diluted feeds very sparingly.

### Fertilizer
Very light, infrequent fertilization with a highly diluted liquid fertilizer; nutrient needs are minimal, as it primarily absorbs nutrients from rain and decaying organic matter.
