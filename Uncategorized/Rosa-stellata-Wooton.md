## Care Guide
This plant thrives in sunny, dry conditions, requiring full sun and infrequent, deep watering. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to lean soils, needing minimal fertilization to prevent overgrowth and encourage flowering. Ensure excellent drainage to mimic its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low nutrient needs. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, using a balanced, slow-release formula in spring, especially in lean native soils. Avoid over-fertilization.
