## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico, Central America, south to Ecuador and Bolivia |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Warm Temperate Montane Forests (e.g., Pine-Oak Forests, Cloud Forests) |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun to partial shade, mimicking its native habitat in forest clearings and open woodlands. Prefers bright, indirect light in hotter climates to prevent leaf scorch. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular watering during its active growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry out slightly between waterings. Its native rocky slopes indicate a need for excellent drainage; reduce watering frequency during any dormant period. |

## Introduction
Cologania is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It belongs to subfamily Faboideae. It includes 13 species of perennial climbing herbs which range from the southwestern United States through Mexico, Central America, and western (Andean) South America to northern Argentina. Most species are montane, and habitats include tropical to warm temperate montane forest, woodland, thicket, wooded grassland, and open bushland on mountain slopes.

## Care Guide
This montane legume thrives in bright conditions, from full sun to partial shade, and prefers regular watering during its growth cycle with excellent drainage. A light, balanced fertilizer supports its health, but excessive nitrogen is unnecessary due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a light to moderate application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen is generally not needed.
