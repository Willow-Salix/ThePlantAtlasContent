## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico and Southwestern United States |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. While tolerant of high light, protect from intense, scorching midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent and light watering, allowing complete drying between applications. Benefits from high ambient humidity or occasional misting rather than direct soil watering. |

## Introduction
Candelina is a small genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Candelariaceae. It comprises three species of yellow-colored, rock-dwelling crustose lichens. The lichens grow on sun-baked rocks in desert and semi-desert regions in the Americas and south-western Africa.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in bright, indirect light conditions, mimicking its arid to semi-arid native habitat. Watering should be very infrequent, allowing it to dry out completely between sparse applications and benefiting from ambient humidity. Fertilization is not required, as lichens gather nutrients from the air and substrate.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air, rain, and the surfaces they colonize.
