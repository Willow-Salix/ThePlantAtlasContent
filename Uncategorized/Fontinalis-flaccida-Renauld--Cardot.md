## Care Guide
Flaccid Fontinalis Moss is an aquatic plant requiring constant submersion in cool, clean water with low to moderate indirect light. It thrives with minimal fertilization, absorbing nutrients directly from its aquatic environment. Maintain stable water conditions for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs; excessive fertilization can harm the plant or encourage algal growth. If absolutely necessary, use very diluted, aquatic plant-specific liquid fertilizers sparingly.
