## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (primarily central and eastern United States, and parts of Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is preferred, as it naturally grows in open, exposed prairie environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is needed, especially during dry spells or establishment. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings, mimicking natural rainfall patterns in its native grassland habitat. |

## Introduction
Solidago sect. Ptarmicoidei is a section of flowering plants in the genus Solidago. They are sometimes considered a separate genus: Oligoneuron. Like related species they are known as goldenrods. This section contains seven species of perennial herbs, all native to North America. They are distinguished from other goldenrods by their corymbiform flowerheads, which are flat or rounded in profile and about as broad as tall or broader, for which they are sometimes called flat-topped goldenrods.

## Care Guide
Stiff Goldenrod thrives in full sun, reflecting its prairie origins. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and generally prefers low to moderate fertilizer. This resilient plant is well-suited for open, sunny locations with average soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant is adapted to average to poor soils of prairies and does not typically require rich fertilization. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth.
