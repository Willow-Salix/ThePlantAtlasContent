## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico, Central America (Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama), Caribbean (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico), and South America (Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, Venezuela). |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Humid Tropical Forests, often found as an epiphyte in lowland to lower montane forests. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light or partial shade. Mimic the dappled light filtering through a forest canopy, avoiding direct, harsh midday sun which can scorch the leaves. |
| **Watering** | Water frequently during active growth, allowing the roots to dry out partially but not completely between waterings to prevent rot. High humidity (60-80%) is crucial and can be maintained through misting, a humidity tray, or a humidifier. |

## Introduction
Trichocentrum, often abbreviated Trctm in horticulture, is a genus in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. Dancinglady orchid is a common name for plants in this genus. It was described by Stephan Ladislaus Endlicher and Eduard Friedrich Poeppig in 1836. This genus alone makes up the monogeneric Trichocentrum alliance, a quite distinct lineage of the subtribe Oncidiinae.
In 2024, Trichocentrum was expanded to include the genera Grandiphyllum and Saundersia, with the latter two synonymized.
As of October 2025, Plants of the World Online recognized 101 species within this genus (plus some hybrids), distributed in damp forests from Mexico and Florida to Argentina.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic orchid thrives in conditions mirroring its tropical forest home, requiring bright, indirect light, consistently high humidity, and frequent watering with excellent drainage. Provide a weak orchid fertilizer during its active growth phase to support its modest nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Feed with a diluted, balanced orchid-specific fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 to 1/2 strength) every 1-2 weeks during the active growing season. Reduce or cease fertilization during periods of dormancy or slower growth.
