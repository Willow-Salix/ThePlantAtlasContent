*Bryhnia graminicolor (Brid.) Grout* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (eastern US and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; thrives in shade to partial shade, avoiding direct harsh sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged; high humidity is beneficial. Regular misting or placement in a terrarium can help maintain moisture. |

## Care Guide
Bryhnia moss thrives in environments mimicking its native temperate forest floor. Provide consistent moisture, high humidity, and low to medium indirect light. Avoid direct sun and waterlogging, and fertilize very sparingly, if at all.

### Fertilizer
Very low; mosses derive most nutrients from water and the environment. Minimal to no fertilization is typically required.
