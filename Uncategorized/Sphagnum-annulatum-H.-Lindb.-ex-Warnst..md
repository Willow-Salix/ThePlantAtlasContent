## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Boreal and Cool Temperate Regions of the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, North America, parts of Asia) |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate and Boreal Bogs/Mires |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade; tolerates some direct morning sun but avoid intense midday sun which can dry it out. |
| **Watering** | Constant saturation is crucial; never allow the moss to dry out. Requires very high humidity, ideally 70-90%. Use pure water (distilled, reverse osmosis, or rainwater) as it is sensitive to minerals. |

## Introduction
Sphagnum is a genus of approximately 380 accepted species of mosses, commonly known as sphagnum moss, also bog moss and quacker moss (although that term is also sometimes used for peat). Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16 to 26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions.
As Sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. Thus, Sphagnum can influence the composition of such habitats, with some describing Sphagnum as 'habitat manipulators' or 'autogenic ecosystem engineers'. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants.
Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions.
Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, and any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.

## Care Guide
Maintain constant saturation with pure water and extremely high humidity to mimic its native bog environment. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade, avoiding direct, harsh sun. fertilization is detrimental; this moss is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Absolutely no fertilizer needed. Sphagnum moss thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic conditions characteristic of bogs and is highly sensitive to dissolved salts and minerals.
