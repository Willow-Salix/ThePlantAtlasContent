## Care Guide
This temperate ephemeral thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring consistent moisture during its vigorous spring growth and bloom. It enters summer dormancy, at which point watering should be significantly reduced. Minimal fertilization is needed for its overall health.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate needs. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in early spring is sufficient.
