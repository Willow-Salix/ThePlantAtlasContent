## Introduction
Potamogeton is a genus of aquatic, mostly freshwater, plants of the family Potamogetonaceae. Most are known by the common name pondweed, although many unrelated plants may be called pondweed, such as Canadian pondweed (Elodea canadensis). The genus name means "river neighbor", originating from the Greek potamos (river) and geiton (neighbor).

## Care Guide
This submerged aquatic plant thrives in temperate freshwater bodies with moderate to bright light. Ensure constant submergence in clear water and provide moderate nutrients without over-fertilizing to prevent algae.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate nutrient levels in the water column and substrate; excessive fertilization can lead to algal growth.
