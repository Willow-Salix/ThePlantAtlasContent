## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Fertile Crescent (Western Asia, including modern-day Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Mediterranean |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for optimal growth and grain development. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate to high; requires consistent moisture, particularly during germination, tillering, and grain filling. Tolerates short dry periods but thrives with regular rainfall or irrigation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Wheat is a group of wild and domesticated grasses of the genus Triticum (). They are cultivated for their cereal grains, which are staple foods around the world. Well-known wheat species and hybrids include the most widely grown common wheat (T. aestivum), spelt, durum, emmer, einkorn, and Khorasan or Kamut. The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BC.
Wheat is grown on a larger area of land than any other food crop (220.7 million hectares or 545 million acres in 2021). World trade in wheat is greater than that of all other crops combined. In 2021, world wheat production was 771 million tonnes (850 million short tons), making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (known as corn in North America and Australia; wheat is often called corn in other countries including Britain). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century. Global demand for wheat is increasing because of the usefulness of gluten to the food industry.
Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates. Globally, it is the leading source of vegetable proteins in human food, having a protein content of about 13%, which is relatively high compared to other major cereals but relatively low in protein quality (supplying essential amino acids). When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fibre. In a small part of the general population, gluten – which comprises most of the protein in wheat – can trigger coeliac disease, noncoeliac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia, and dermatitis herpetiformis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Plant in an open area with full sun exposure and well-drained, fertile soil. Provide consistent moisture, especially during key growth stages, and apply a balanced fertilizer to support strong growth and grain production.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
High; naturally grows in fertile soils but for robust growth and yield, benefits significantly from supplementation with a balanced NPK fertilizer, especially nitrogen.
