## Introduction
Endocarpon is a genus of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), squamulose lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. It comprises 23 species. The genus is characterised by its enclosed fruiting bodies (perithecia) embedded within the scales and its compartmentalised spores. Species in this genus typically grow on rocks, often in areas that experience periodic moisture.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in harsh, arid environments on exposed rocks, requiring high light and tolerating prolonged dry periods. It obtains all necessary moisture and nutrients from atmospheric sources and its substrate, making traditional watering and fertilization unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; obtains nutrients from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust) and minerals from its rock substrate.
