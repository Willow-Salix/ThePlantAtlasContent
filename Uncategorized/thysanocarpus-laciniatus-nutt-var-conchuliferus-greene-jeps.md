## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. Provide moderate water during its spring growing season, then allow it to dry out as it is drought-tolerant. Fertilization needs are minimal.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied once during its active growth if desired, but often not necessary.
