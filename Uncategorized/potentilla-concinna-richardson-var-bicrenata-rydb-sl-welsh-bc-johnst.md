## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains, from Alberta, Canada, south to New Mexico, USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine Meadow/Montane Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its natural habitat in open, exposed meadows. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerates periods of drought once established, mimicking varied precipitation patterns in its native range. |

## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its subalpine meadow origin. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between waterings, and fertilize sparingly, as it is adapted to less nutrient-rich environments. It is hardy and generally low-maintenance once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor, well-drained soils; excessive fertilization is generally not needed.
