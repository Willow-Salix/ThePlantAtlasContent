## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), typical of open desert and scrubland habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low to infrequent; it is highly drought-tolerant once established, preferring well-drained soil that dries out completely between waterings, mimicking arid rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
This lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soil, requiring minimal water once established due to its adaptation to arid conditions. Avoid overwatering and excessive fertilization, especially nitrogen, to ensure optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
None to very low; like most lupines, it's a nitrogen-fixing legume and thrives in lean, poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
