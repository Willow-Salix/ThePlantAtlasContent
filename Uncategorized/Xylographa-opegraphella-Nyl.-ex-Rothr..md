## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Boreal and Temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America (e.g., Canada, USA) and Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Central Europe). |
| **Climate** | Boreal and Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect or filtered light; thrives in moderate to low light conditions and should be protected from direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and regular moisture. Frequent misting is beneficial, but ensure adequate air circulation to prevent stagnant conditions. |

## Introduction
Xylographa is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Xylographaceae. These lichens are commonly found growing on decaying wood, where they form thin, often nearly invisible crusts. The genus is most readily recognized by its distinctive elongated, slit-like fruiting bodies that follow the grain of the wood.

## Care Guide
To care for Xylographa lichen, replicate its native boreal and temperate forest environment by providing indirect or filtered light and maintaining high ambient humidity with frequent misting. Avoid using any traditional fertilizers, as these sensitive organisms derive nutrients naturally from the atmosphere and their substrate.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate (e.g., decaying wood) and are highly sensitive to chemical fertilizers.
