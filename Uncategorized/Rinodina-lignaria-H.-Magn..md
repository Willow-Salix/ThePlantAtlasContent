## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe (e.g., Fennoscandia, Central Europe) and North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, California). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | As a lignicolous (wood-dwelling) lichen, it thrives in well-lit but not constantly direct sun positions. Prefers moderate to bright indirect light, mimicking the dappled sunlight found on tree bark or exposed deadwood in a forest environment. |
| **Watering** | Requires frequent exposure to moisture (rain, dew) and high atmospheric humidity to remain metabolically active. Consistent rewetting cycles are essential, as it absorbs water directly from the environment. |

## Introduction
Rinodina is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 265 species. It is hypothesized that a few saxicolous species common to dry regions of western North America, southern Europe, North Africa and central Asia may date back 240 million years to the Middle Triassic.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in environments with moderate to bright indirect light and high atmospheric humidity, mimicking its native temperate forest habitat. It requires regular rewetting cycles and natural atmospheric nutrient uptake, with no need for traditional fertilizers as excess nutrients can be harmful.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilization. It obtains all necessary nutrients directly from the atmosphere (dust, rain) and its substrate. Excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
