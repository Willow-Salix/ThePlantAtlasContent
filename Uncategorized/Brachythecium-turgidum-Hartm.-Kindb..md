## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions across North America, Europe, and Asia; also in alpine zones of temperate mountains. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to indirect bright light. While found in open alpine environments, intense direct sun can cause desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but avoid waterlogging. Requires high humidity or frequent misting, mimicking the often damp conditions of its native habitat (snowmelt, fog). |

## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine moss thrives in cool, moist conditions with consistent humidity. Provide partial to indirect bright light and ensure the substrate remains consistently moist but not waterlogged. Avoid direct strong sun and heavy fertilization, as it has low nutrient demands and prefers ambient moisture.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Mosses are non-vascular and derive most nutrients from water and the surrounding substrate, which is typically nutrient-poor in its native climate.
