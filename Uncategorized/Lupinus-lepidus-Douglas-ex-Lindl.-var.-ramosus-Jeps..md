## Care Guide
This Pacific Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining, average to poor soil, mirroring its native montane and steppe habitats. It requires moderate to low watering, being drought-tolerant once established, and has minimal fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. Thrives in average to poor, well-draining soils.
