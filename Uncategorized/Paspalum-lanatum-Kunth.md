## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern South America (e.g., Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland (Pampa biome) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires abundant direct sunlight characteristic of open grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; prefers consistent moisture during its active growing season, but is tolerant of short dry spells typical of grassland climates with seasonal rainfall. |

## Introduction
Paspalum is a genus of plants in the grass family.
The group is widespread across much of Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. Commonly known as paspalum, bahiagrasses, crowngrasses or dallis grasses, many of the species are tall perennial New World grasses. They are warm-season C4 grasses and are most diverse in subtropical and tropical regions.
Paspalum scrobiculatum (koda, varuka, varuku, etc.) is a millet locally grown as food grain. Some species, such as bahiagrass (P. notatum) and P. nicorae, are grown for pasturage, especially with the perennial forage peanut (Arachis glabrata) as a companion crop. Bahiagrass has also some significance as a honey plant.
Water finger-grass (P. vaginatum) resembles bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), but has a higher salinity tolerance and can consume greywater. It is not infrequently used for arena and golf course turf in warmer coastal regions, such as Baja California, Florida, Peru, Texas and Venezuela. Dedicated paspalum cultivars such as 'Aloha Seashore' or 'Platinum TE' have been produced for such uses.
Paspalums are also food for caterpillars of lepidopterans such as the pasture day moth (Apina callisto), and those of the dark palm dart (Telicota ancilla) which feed on P. urvillei. Granivorous birds often eat paspalum seeds; the chestnut-breasted munia (Lonchura castaneothorax) readily feeds on the seeds of  P. longifolium, for example.
The ergot Claviceps paspali is a sac fungus that grows on Paspalum, producing ergot alkaloids and the tremorgen paspalitrem; it causes "paspalum staggers" poisoning in cattle.
Tussock paspalum (P. quadrifarium) is considered a noxious weed in Australia. The term “paspalum” without qualification in Australia refers to the common lawn weed P. dilatatum.  Australia has five native  and approximately sixteen naturalised species.
Daikin Park, the home ballpark of the Houston Astros, has Platinum TE Paspalum as its field surface.

## Care Guide
Paspalum lanatum thrives in full sun with moderate and consistent watering during its growing season, showing resilience to brief dry periods. It requires low to moderate fertilization to mimic its native temperate grassland conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer during the growing season, especially in nutrient-poor soils, reflecting the moderately fertile soils of its native habitat.
