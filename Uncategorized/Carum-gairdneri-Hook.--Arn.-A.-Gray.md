## Care Guide
Gairdner's Yampah thrives in temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently moist soil, mimicking its native habitat in meadows and along stream banks. Ensure moderate soil fertility with good drainage, ideally by amending with organic matter.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility; benefits from rich, well-draining soil amended with organic matter. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly if soil nutrients are low.
