## Care Guide
To care for this Gyalideopsis lichen, replicate its native tropical rainforest conditions by providing very low, indirect light and maintaining extremely high humidity with consistent moisture. Avoid direct sun exposure and refrain from using any traditional fertilizers, as it naturally acquires its nutrients from the environment.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers. Lichens obtain nutrients from atmospheric particles and their substrate, so commercial fertilizers can be harmful.
