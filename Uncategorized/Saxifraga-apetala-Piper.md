## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
To care for Western Swamp Saxifrage, ensure the soil remains consistently wet, mimicking its native boggy habitat. Provide bright, indirect light to partial sun, protecting it from intense afternoon heat. Fertilize lightly during the growing season, avoiding over-feeding.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season.
