## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily Arizona, Utah, Nevada, California) |
| **Climate** | Arid Woodland / Desert Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), tolerant of intense heat. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant once established; requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions. Overwatering should be avoided. |

## Introduction
Fraxinus (), commonly called ash, is a genus of plants in the olive and lilac family, Oleaceae, and comprises 45–65 species of usually medium-to-large trees, most of which are deciduous (dropping their leaves in autumn), although some subtropical species are evergreen. The genus is widespread throughout much of Europe, Asia, and North America.
The leaves are usually opposite, and mostly pinnately compound (divided into leaflets in a feather-like arrangement). The seeds, known as "keys", are botanically fruits of the type called samara. Some species are dioecious, having male and female flowers on separate plants.
Ash wood is strong and elastic, and used for the handles of tools. Musical instrument makers use it for electric guitars and for drum shells. The Morgan Motor Company makes the frames of sports cars from ash wood. In Greek mythology, the Meliae were the nymphs of ash trees.

## Care Guide
The Singleleaf Ash is a resilient desert-adapted tree requiring full sun and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent deep watering once established, and thrives with minimal fertilization. Avoid overwatering to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is needed; thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer once in spring, only if growth appears weak or soil is exceptionally poor.
