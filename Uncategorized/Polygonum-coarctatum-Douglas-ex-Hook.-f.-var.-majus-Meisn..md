## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Pacific Northwest, including British Columbia, Washington, Oregon) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine (e.g., meadows, open slopes, rocky areas) |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun, especially in cooler montane environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings. Prefers consistent moisture during the growing season, but requires good drainage. |

## Introduction
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## Care Guide
Douglas's Knotweed var. majus thrives in conditions mimicking its native Pacific Northwest montane environment. Provide full to partial sun and well-drained soil, ensuring moderate, consistent moisture during the growing season while avoiding waterlogging. It generally requires low to moderate fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate fertilizer needs. A light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is generally sufficient.
