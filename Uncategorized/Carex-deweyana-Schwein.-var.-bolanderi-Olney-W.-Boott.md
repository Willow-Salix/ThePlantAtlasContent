## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Bolander's Sedge thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil and prefers partial to full shade, mimicking its native habitat in temperate woodlands and riparian zones. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry periods, and provide moderate soil fertility with organic matter for best growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Benefits from organically rich soil; light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring can support growth.
