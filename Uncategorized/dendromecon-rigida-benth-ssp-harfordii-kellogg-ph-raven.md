| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California Channel Islands (specifically Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Coastal Scrubland / Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Very low; drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly during cooler growing seasons and reduce significantly, or withhold, during hot, dry summers to mimic native rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dendromecon, the tree poppy, is a genus of one or two species of shrubs to small trees, native to California and northern Baja California.
The leaves are evergreen, alternate, lanceolate to ovate, 3–10 cm long. The flowers are yellow, satiny, and shed after pollination.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, emulating its native Mediterranean coastal scrub. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal water, especially during summer dormancy, and generally does not need fertilizer. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None to very low; adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of chaparral environments. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
