## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Globally widespread in alpine and subpolar regions, including mountainous areas of North America, Europe, Asia, and Antarctica. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subpolar Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to full sun in cool conditions; benefits from partial shade in warmer environments to prevent desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture, ensuring excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging; benefits from high ambient humidity or frequent misting. |

## 🌱 Overview
Andreaea is a genus of rock mosses described by Johann Hedwig in 1801.
They are small, delicate acrocarpous mosses (meaning that the capsules are formed at the tips of vertical branches) that form dark brown or reddish cushions on wet siliceous rocks in mountainous areas. The capsule lacks the peristome teeth and operculum of other mosses, and opens by splitting along 4 vertical slits, the four valves remaining joined at the base and apex. The capsule of Andreaea has no seta, but the sporophyte (Spf in the diagram below) instead is supported by a pseudopodium (ps) derived from gametophyte tissue, as in Sphagnum and the columella is enclosed within the sporangium. The spores germinate to give thalloid protonemata.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Andreaea moss thrives in cool, consistently moist environments, mimicking its native alpine and subpolar habitats. It tolerates bright light in cool conditions but needs excellent drainage, high humidity, and requires little to no supplemental fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None or very minimal, extremely dilute fertilizer, as native habitats are nutrient-poor.
