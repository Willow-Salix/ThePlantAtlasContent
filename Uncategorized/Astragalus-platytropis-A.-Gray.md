## Care Guide
Broadkeel Milkvetch thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its alpine origins. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities and adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and thrives in lean, rocky soils. If necessary, use a very dilute, balanced, or low-nitrogen fertilizer sparingly.
