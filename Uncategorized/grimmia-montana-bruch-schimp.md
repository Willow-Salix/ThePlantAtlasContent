## 🧤 Care Instructions
Grimmia montana is a resilient moss adapted to harsh montane environments. Provide full to partial sun exposure and allow it to dry out extensively between infrequent waterings. Fertilization is generally not needed due to its low nutrient requirements.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; typically no fertilization is required as it naturally thrives on nutrient-poor siliceous rocks.
