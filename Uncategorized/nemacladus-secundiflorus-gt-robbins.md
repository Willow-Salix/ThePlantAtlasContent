## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Onesided Threadplant thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid environments. Provide abundant direct sunlight and minimal water, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between rare waterings. Its adaptation to nutrient-poor desert soils means it requires very little, if any, supplemental fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, or may not be necessary in appropriate soil.
