## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal, specifically eastern parts including Alaska, Yukon, Russian Far East, Siberia, and parts of China. |
| **Climate** | Subarctic, Boreal, and Alpine Tundra, Moist Temperate Grassland. Characterized by cold winters, cool to mild summers, and often consistent moisture from snowmelt or rainfall. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open, exposed locations, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in warmer regions. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil is preferred. Water regularly to keep the soil from drying out, especially during prolonged dry spells. Tolerates wet conditions and some drought once established. |

## Care Guide
This grass thrives in cool, moist conditions reminiscent of its subarctic and alpine native habitat. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure consistent soil moisture. Fertilization needs are minimal, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or it may not require fertilization in naturally fertile soils.
