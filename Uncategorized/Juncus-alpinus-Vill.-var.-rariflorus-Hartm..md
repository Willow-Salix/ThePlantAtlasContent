## Care Guide
The Alpine Rush thrives in consistently wet to very moist soil, mimicking its native cool temperate to subalpine wetland habitat. It prefers full sun to partial shade and requires low to moderate fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native wetland and bog environments can often be nutrient-poor, suggesting it is not a heavy feeder.
