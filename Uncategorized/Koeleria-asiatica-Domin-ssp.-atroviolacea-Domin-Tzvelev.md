## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate Eurasia, including Central Asia, Siberia, Mongolia, Northern China, and parts of Eastern Europe |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland (Steppe) and Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is ideal, reflecting its open grassland and steppe habitat. Can tolerate some partial sun in very hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid waterlogging, as it prefers conditions mimicking arid to semi-arid rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Koeleria is a common and widespread genus of plants in the grass family, found on all continents except Antarctica and on various oceanic islands. It includes species known generally as Junegrasses.
The genus was named after German botanist Georg Ludwig Koeler (1765–1807).

Species

Formerly included
hundreds of species once included in Koeleria but now considered better suited to other genera including Aeluropus, Agrostis, Colpodium, Dactylis, Erioneuron, Festuca, Graphephorum, Rostraria, Schismus, Sesleria, Trisetaria and Trisetum.

## Care Guide
Eurasian Junegrass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native temperate steppe and subalpine meadow environments. This hardy grass is highly drought-tolerant, needing minimal watering once established, and requires little to no fertilization. The key to its care is providing dry, open, and sunny conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced granular fertilizer in early spring can be applied if growth seems sluggish.
