## Introduction
Astragalus is a large genus of over 3,000 species of herbs and small shrubs, belonging to the legume family Fabaceae and the subfamily Faboideae. It is the largest genus of plants in terms of described species. The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Common names include milkvetch (most species), locoweed (in North America, some species) and goat's-thorn (A. gummifer, A. tragacantha). Some pale-flowered vetches (Vicia spp.) are similar in appearance, but they are more vine-like than Astragalus.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun, reflecting its native semi-arid grassland habitat. It requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. Optimal growth occurs in lean soils, making heavy fertilization unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; avoid heavy fertilization, especially nitrogen
