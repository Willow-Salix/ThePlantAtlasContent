## Introduction
Isolepis is a genus of flowering plants in the sedge family, containing around 70 species. Isolepis is cosmopolitan, and often found in cool tropical and temperate climates in Africa and Australasia.
Isolepis was first described by prolific botanist Robert Brown in 1810. In 1870, the botanist Boeckeler disbanded the genus putting most of the names under a different genus, Scirpus. By the early 20th century Isolepis ceased to exist with other botanists following on from Boeckler's work. It was not until the late 20th century that Isolepis was reinstated as a distinct genus due to embryological research.

## Care Guide
This wetland plant thrives in consistently wet to submerged conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires high moisture and generally low to moderate fertilization to mimic its natural marshland habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly, perhaps once a month during active growth, if not grown in naturally nutrient-rich conditions.
