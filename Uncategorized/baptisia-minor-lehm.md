| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Southern United States (e.g., Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, Texas) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it naturally grows in open, exposed prairies. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate watering; it is highly drought-tolerant once established, thriving on natural rainfall typical of its prairie habitat. Avoid overwatering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Baptisia (wild indigo, false indigo) is a genus in the legume family, Fabaceae. They are flowering herbaceous perennial plants with pea-like flowers, followed by pods, which are sometimes inflated. They are native to woodland and grassland in eastern and southern North America. The species most commonly found in cultivation is B. australis.
Baptisia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the jaguar flower moth, Schinia jaguarina.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in full sun exposures, Dwarf Blue Wild Indigo requires minimal watering once established, reflecting its drought-tolerant nature from prairie environments. Avoid excessive fertilization, as this nitrogen-fixing legume prefers leaner soils and can become leggy with too many nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil naturally. Fertilizing is generally unnecessary and can even lead to leggy growth.
