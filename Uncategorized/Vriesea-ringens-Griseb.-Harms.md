## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Greater Antilles (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico) and other Caribbean islands |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest / Moist Tropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Protect from direct, intense sunlight which can scorch leaves, especially during the hottest parts of the day. |
| **Watering** | Keep the central 'cup' or 'tank' filled with fresh water, flushing it periodically to prevent stagnation. Water the potting medium (if potted) when the top inch feels dry, ensuring good drainage. High humidity is beneficial. |

## Introduction
Vriesea is a genus of flowering plants in the botanical family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Tillandsioideae. The genus is named after the Dutch botanist and physician Willem Hendrik de Vriese (1806–1862). Its species are widespread over Mexico, Central America, South America and the West Indies.
The genus includes many "tank bromeliads", which store water in a reservoir (a "tank") formed by their tightly overlapping leaf bases. Containing some of the largest bromeliad species, these tropical plants hold a wide variety of insect fauna. In the wild, some frog species go through their whole life cycle in these bromeliad tanks. This genus is closely related to Guzmania. Both Guzmania and Vriesea have dry capsules that split open to release parachute like seeds similar to dandelions (Taraxacum sp.). Most Vriesea are epiphytes and grow on trees. Their roots function mainly as holdfasts with a more minor role in nutrient uptake. Nutrients are predominantly absorbed from the reservoirs made by the rosette of leaves.

## Care Guide
Vriesea ringens thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical moist forests, requiring bright indirect light and high humidity. Maintain water in its central cup and provide light, regular fertilization, protecting it from direct sun.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization is needed, typically a diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 strength) applied to the cup or sprayed on the leaves every 2-4 weeks during the growing season. Avoid heavy feeding.
