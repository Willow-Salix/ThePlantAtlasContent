| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Andean regions of northern South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Montane Forest / Cloud Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade, protecting from harsh direct sun as it typically grows under a dense canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, mimicking frequent rainfall. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, ensuring good drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Rattan, also spelled ratan (from Malay: rotan), is the name for roughly 600 species of Old World climbing palms belonging to subfamily Calamoideae. The greatest diversity of rattan palm species and genera are in the closed-canopy old-growth tropical forests of Southeast Asia, though they can also be found in other parts of tropical Asia and Africa. Most rattan palms are ecologically considered lianas due to their climbing habits, unlike other palm species. A few species also have tree-like or shrub-like habits.
Around 20% of rattan palm species are economically important and are traditionally used in Southeast Asia in producing wickerwork furniture, baskets, canes, woven mats, cordage, and other handicrafts. Rattan canes are one of the world's most valuable non-timber forest products. Some species of rattan also have edible scaly fruit and heart of palm. Despite increasing attempts in the last 30 years at commercial cultivation, almost all rattan products still come from wild-harvested plants. Rattan supplies are now rapidly threatened due to deforestation and overexploitation. Rattan were also historically known as Manila cane or Malacca cane, based on their trade origins, as well as numerous other trade names for individual species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, typical of its montane forest origins. It requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from regular, moderate fertilization during its growth period to mimic its natural environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season, reflecting the nutrient-rich forest floor.
