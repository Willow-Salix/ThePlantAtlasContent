## Introduction
Cenchrus is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family, native to tropical and warm temperate regions of the world. Its species are native to many countries in Asia, Africa, Australia, the Americas, and various oceanic islands.
Common names include buffelgrasses, sandburs, and sand spur. Such names allude to the sharp, spine-covered burrs characterizing the inflorescences of the members of the genus. Those previously classified as Pennisetum  are known commonly as fountaingrasses (fountain grasses).

## Care Guide
This robust perennial grass thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native tropical grassland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering, and needs only minimal fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization is sufficient; apply a balanced slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring if growth appears sluggish.
