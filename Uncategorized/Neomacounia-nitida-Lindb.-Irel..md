## Care Guide
Neomacounia Moss thrives in cool, highly humid environments typical of its native temperate rainforests. Ensure consistently moist substrate with excellent drainage, paired with high ambient humidity through misting or enclosure. It prefers low to medium indirect light and needs minimal to no nutrient supplementation.

### Fertilizer
Very low; mosses generally have minimal nutrient needs, getting what they require from water runoff or decaying organic matter on their native substrates.
