## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Sierra Nevada mountain range (California, Nevada, Oregon) |
| **Climate** | Arid Montane |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings. Requires excellent drainage and is sensitive to overwatering. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and requires exceptionally well-drained soil, mimicking its arid montane habitat. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and needs minimal watering and virtually no fertilizer to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. If absolutely necessary, a minimal application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer can be given in early spring.
