## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically western United States and British Columbia, Canada) |
| **Climate** | Alpine/Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, reflecting its growth in open, exposed mountain slopes and meadows. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate watering. Prefers well-drained soil and tolerates periods of drought once established, similar to conditions after snowmelt subsides in its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## Care Guide
Pygmy Pussytoes is a hardy alpine plant requiring full sun and excellent drainage to mimic its native mountain habitat. It is drought-tolerant and thrives with minimal watering once established, needing very little to no supplemental fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Native to lean, rocky, nutrient-poor soils, it does not require significant fertilization and can be harmed by over-fertilization.
