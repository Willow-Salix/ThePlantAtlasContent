## Care Guide
Stiff Fendlerbush is a hardy shrub adapted to arid conditions, requiring full sun and minimal water once established. It thrives in lean soils, making fertilizer generally unnecessary. The key is to avoid overwatering and provide ample sunlight.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in lean, well-draining soils. Fertilizer is rarely needed; a light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in very poor soils, but is often unnecessary.
