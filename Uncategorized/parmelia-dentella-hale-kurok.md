## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a lichen, Parmelia dentella thrives in environments with high atmospheric humidity, clean air, and filtered light. It acquires all necessary moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere and its substrate, making it fundamentally different from typical potted plants and unsuitable for traditional indoor care.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; obtains all necessary nutrients from atmospheric dust, dissolved minerals in precipitation, and its substrate.
