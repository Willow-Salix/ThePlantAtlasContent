## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
Hadley's Hawthorn thrives in conditions mirroring its native Northeastern US temperate forests. It requires full sun to partial shade and regular watering to ensure consistently moist, well-drained soil. A moderate annual fertilization regime supports healthy growth, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant once established.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer annually, particularly when young or in poor soil.
