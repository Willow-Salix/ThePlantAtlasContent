## 🧤 Care Instructions
Carolina Clubmoss requires a consistently wet environment, mimicking its native boggy or marshy habitats. Provide bright indirect light to partial sun, avoiding intense direct sun that could dry it out. Fertilizer needs are very low due to its adaptation to poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal. These plants are adapted to nutrient-poor soils. A highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season, or often no fertilizer is needed.
