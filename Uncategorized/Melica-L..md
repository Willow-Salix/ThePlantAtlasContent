## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of North America, Eurasia, and parts of South America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodlands and Grasslands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, adaptable depending on the specific species and its natural habitat. Many species tolerate some shade, particularly in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, ensuring consistently moist but well-drained soil during active growth. Tolerates drier conditions once established, reflecting periods of lower rainfall in temperate zones. |

## Introduction
Melica is a genus of perennial grasses known generally as melic or melic grass. They are found in most temperate regions of the world.

Melic grasses are clumping to short-rhizomatous grasses. They have flowering culms up to 250 cm (98 in) tall bearing spikelets of papery flowers. The spikelets have between one and seven fertile flowers with a rudimentary structure at the distal end composed of one to four sterile florets. Some species of melic have corms, lending them the name oniongrass.
The genus is most diverse in South America and temperate Asia. Eight species are endemic to China. In North America, most species occur west of the Mississippi River, with exceptions being Melica mutica and M. nitens which occur throughout much of the southeast and lower Midwest respectively.

## Care Guide
Melicgrass, native to temperate woodlands and grasslands, generally prefers full sun to partial shade and moderate watering in well-drained soil. It benefits from light fertilization during the growing season and shows good drought tolerance once established.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring to support lush growth, as native soils can vary in richness but are typically not extremely poor.
