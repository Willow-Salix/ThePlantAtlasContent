## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Primarily Southern and Western Europe (e.g., Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, UK), North Africa, and Macaronesia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate, seasonally moist open habitats, often associated with Mediterranean-influenced regions. |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Protect from intense, direct afternoon sun which can quickly dry it out. |
| **Watering** | Keep the substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged. High ambient humidity is crucial for its survival and growth, mimicking its native damp ground conditions. |

## Care Guide
Micheli's Bottlewort thrives in consistently moist conditions with high ambient humidity, requiring bright indirect light or partial shade. Ensure its substrate remains damp but never waterlogged, and protect it from harsh direct sun exposure. Due to its nature as a liverwort, fertilization is rarely needed.

### Fertilizer
Very minimal to no fertilizer is typically required. If desired, a highly diluted (e.g., 1/4 strength) balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied very infrequently during active growth.
