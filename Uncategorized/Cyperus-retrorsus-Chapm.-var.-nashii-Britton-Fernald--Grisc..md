| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Texas) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in pine flatwoods, moist sandy areas, and disturbed wetland fringes) |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Shade. In its native habitat, it grows in open, often disturbed areas or under the partial canopy of pine trees. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist to wet. This plant naturally occurs in areas with high soil moisture, indicating it prefers saturated conditions and does not tolerate drying out. |

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in consistently moist to wet soil conditions, mimicking its native humid subtropical habitat. Provide it with full sun to partial shade exposure and apply light to moderate fertilization during the active growing period to support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season. Its native soils in pinelands can be nutrient-poor, suggesting it is not a heavy feeder.
