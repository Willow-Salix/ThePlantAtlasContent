## Care Guide
Bailey's pseudoleskea moss thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions, mimicking its native temperate rainforest habitat. Ensure consistent moisture and high humidity, avoiding direct sunlight. Fertilization should be minimal, as mosses are not heavy feeders.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses primarily absorb nutrients from water and atmospheric deposition; over-fertilization can be detrimental.
