## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically high-elevation regions of the Rocky Mountains and other western ranges. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) to partial sun, reflecting its open, high-altitude native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, deep watering once established; highly drought-tolerant and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its adaptation to snowmelt-fed, often dry, rocky mountain soils. |

## 🌱 Overview
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rocky Mountain Pussytoes thrive in conditions mimicking their native high-altitude environment. Provide full sun, exceptionally well-drained soil, and very little water once established, as they are adapted to lean, dry conditions with minimal nutrient input.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its native mountain environment.
