## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical fern requires conditions similar to its native rainforest understory, meaning high humidity and consistently moist soil. Provide low to medium indirect light, shielding it from any direct sun, and fertilize sparingly during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
