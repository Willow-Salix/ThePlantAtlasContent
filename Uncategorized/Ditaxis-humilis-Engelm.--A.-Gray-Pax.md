## Introduction
Ditaxis is a plant genus of the family Euphorbiaceae first described as a genus in 1824. Its name comes from Greek dis ("two") and taxis ("rank"), referring to the stamens which are in two whorls. The genus is widespread across much of the Western Hemisphere from the southern United States to Uruguay.

## Care Guide
Dwarf Ditaxis is a robust desert plant that thrives in full sun conditions. It requires very little water, being highly drought-tolerant, so allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to arid, nutrient-scarce environments.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; this plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and generally does not require regular fertilization. A very light, balanced feed can be applied once in spring if growth seems weak.
