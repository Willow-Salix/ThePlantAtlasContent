## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Intermountain West and Great Plains, including states such as Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. |
| **Climate** | Arid Grassland and Sagebrush Steppe. Characterized by distinct seasons, with cold winters and hot, often dry, summers; found in open, exposed areas. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in environments with several hours of direct sunlight daily, consistent with its native open grassland and sagebrush habitats. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. This plant is drought-tolerant, preferring infrequent but deep watering that allows the soil to dry out completely between sessions. Overwatering, particularly in its dormant phase, should be strictly avoided. |

## Introduction
Cymopterus is a genus of perennial plants in the family Apiaceae native to western North America. They are commonly known as the spring parsleys and are edible. They are mostly stemless, taprooted perennial herbs with leaves at ground level and flowering scapes bearing yellow, white, or purple flowers.

## Care Guide
Bulbous Springparsley prefers full sun and well-drained, lean soil, mirroring its native arid grassland environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization. This makes it a low-maintenance plant suitable for dry, sunny conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Naturally adapted to lean, sandy, or gravelly soils typical of arid regions. If fertilization is deemed necessary, a very dilute, balanced slow-release formula should be applied sparingly during its active growth period.
