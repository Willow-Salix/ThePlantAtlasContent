## Introduction
Prunus is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs from the family Rosaceae. The genus includes plums, cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots and almonds (collectively stonefruit). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, being native to the temperate regions of North America, the neotropics of South America, and temperate and tropical regions of Eurasia and Africa, There are about 340 accepted species as of March 2024.
Many members of the genus are widely cultivated for their sweet, fleshy fruit and for decorative purposes of their flowers. Prunus fruit are drupes, or stone fruits. The fleshy mesocarp surrounding the endocarp is edible while the endocarp itself forms a hard, inedible shell called the pyrena ("stone" or "pit"). This shell encloses the seed (or "kernel"), which is edible in some species (such as sweet almonds), but poisonous in many others (such as apricot kernels). Besides being eaten off the hand, most Prunus fruit  are also commonly used in processing, such as jam production, canning, drying, and the seeds for roasting.

## Care Guide
This adaptable plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during establishment. While preferring regular moisture, mature Western Chokecherries exhibit good drought tolerance. Minimal fertilization is required, benefiting most from a yearly addition of compost to enrich the soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from rich organic matter in the soil; an annual top-dressing of compost or a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient.
