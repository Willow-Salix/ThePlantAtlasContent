## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in environments with high humidity and good air circulation, typically found on exposed rocks in temperate regions. It requires bright, indirect light to partial sun and absorbs moisture from regular misting, not traditional soil watering. No fertilization is needed as it gathers nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
No fertilization necessary. This lichen obtains all required nutrients from the atmosphere and its host lichen or mineral substrate.
