## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soil, mimicking its arid habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and avoid excessive fertilization. Ensure good air circulation and mimic drought conditions for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. If grown in very poor soil, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer might be applied once in spring, but it generally thrives in lean conditions.
