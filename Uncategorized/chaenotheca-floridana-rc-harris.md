## 🌱 Overview
Chaenotheca is a genus of lichenized fungi within the family Coniocybaceae. The sexual reproduction structures are a mass of loose ascospores that are enclosed by a cup shaped exciple sitting on top of a tiny stalk, having the appearance of a dressmaker's pin (called a mazaedium), hence the common name pin lichen. Genus members are also commonly called needle lichens. Photobiont partners for Chaenotheca include members of the algae genera Symbiochloris, Trebouxia, Trentepohlia, and Tritostichococcus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rare epiphytic lichen, native to Florida's humid subtropical environments, requires consistently high ambient humidity and frequent moisture from mist or rain. It thrives in partial shade to indirect light and obtains all its nutrients from the atmosphere and its substrate, thus requiring no traditional watering or fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air, rainfall, and their substrate.
