## 🌱 Overview
Tilia is a genus of about 30 species of trees or bushes, native throughout most of the temperate Northern Hemisphere. The species are known as linden or lime for the European and Asian species, and linden or basswood for North American species and more generally in American literature. The greatest species diversity is found in Asia, but the genus also occurs widely in Europe and eastern North America. Under the Cronquist classification system, this genus was placed in the family Tiliaceae, but genetic research summarised by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has resulted in the incorporation of this genus, and of most of the previous family, into the Malvaceae.
Tilia is the only known ectomycorrhizal genus in the family Malvaceae. Studies of ectomycorrhizal relations of Tilia species indicate a wide range of fungal symbionts and a preference toward Ascomycota fungal partners.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tree thrives in temperate conditions with full sun to partial shade. It requires consistent moisture, particularly when young, and benefits from moderate fertilization to emulate its native forest environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate, balanced fertilizer in spring for young or newly planted trees to support robust growth, reflecting the naturally rich organic soils of its forest habitat.
