## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in high humidity and indirect light, mimicking its native tropical forest understory. Ensure consistent moisture through regular misting and maintain high ambient humidity to prevent desiccation. No traditional fertilization is required, as it absorbs nutrients from the air and moisture.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none. As a lichen, it obtains necessary nutrients primarily from atmospheric deposition (rain, dust) and the substrate surface, not from traditional soil fertilization.
