## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, New Guinea, and northern Australia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Monsoon Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light; avoid direct harsh sun. Dappled shade to filtered light is ideal, mimicking their growth beneath a tree canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Frequent watering, often daily or every other day, especially during active growth. As epiphytes, their roots dry quickly, so excellent drainage and high humidity (70-90%) are crucial. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Chiloschista orchids flourish in conditions mimicking their native tropical rainforests, demanding bright, indirect light and very high humidity. Frequent watering with quick drainage is essential, alongside light, diluted fertilization during their active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a highly diluted balanced orchid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 to 1/8 strength) applied frequently, particularly during the growing season. They absorb nutrients from rainwater and decaying organic matter.
