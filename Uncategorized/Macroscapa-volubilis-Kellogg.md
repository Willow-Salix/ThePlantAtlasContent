## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Chaparral Cucumber thrives in full sun with well-drained soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean chaparral environment. Provide moderate watering during its active growth period in cooler months, then allow it to dry out and enter dormancy during hot summers, requiring minimal to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. It is adapted to lean, well-drained soils; over-fertilizing can be detrimental. A light, balanced fertilizer might be applied once during active growth if desired.
