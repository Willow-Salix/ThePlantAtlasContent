## Introduction
Dichelostemma is a genus of  North American plants closely related to the genus Brodiaea and sometimes regarded as part of that group.
Dichelostemma is classified in the cluster-lily subfamily within the asparagus family. in the latest Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification (2009). Older sources often placed it in the lily family; earlier versions of the APG classifications used the family Themidaceae.
The genus is native to the North America, especially in northern California, but also east to New Mexico and north to British Columbia and south into northwestern Mexico.
These plants grow from perennial corms that produce a raceme or umbel-like inflorescence. The flowers are bell- or tube-shaped and produce capsules with black seeds. The name, from the Greek for "toothed crown", refers to the stamen appendages.

## Care Guide
The Chaparral Cucumber thrives in full sun with well-drained soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean chaparral environment. Provide moderate watering during its active growth period in cooler months, then allow it to dry out and enter dormancy during hot summers, requiring minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. It is adapted to lean, well-drained soils; over-fertilizing can be detrimental. A light, balanced fertilizer might be applied once during active growth if desired.
