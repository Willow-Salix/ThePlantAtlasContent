## Care Guide
Red Campion is a hardy perennial best suited for temperate climates, preferring a location with partial to full sun. It thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil and typically requires only low to moderate fertilization. This makes it a low-maintenance choice for naturalized areas or informal gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average, fertile, well-draining soil. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring or a layer of compost is usually sufficient, or none if soil is naturally rich.
