## Introduction
Dianthus caryophyllus ( dy-AN-thəs KAIR-ee-ə-FIL-əs), commonly known as carnation or clove pink, is a species of Dianthus native to the Mediterranean region. While its exact natural range is uncertain due to extensive cultivation over the last 2,000 years, wild carnations are most common in the Mediterranean region. Carnations are prized for their wide variety of colors, delicate fringed petals, and fragrance, often described as spicy, clove-like, or reminiscent of a combination of cinnamon and nutmeg, hence the common name "clove pink". This aroma has made carnations a popular choice for use in perfumes, potpourri, and scented products. Culturally, carnations are associated with affection, distinction, and maternal love, with variations depending on color and area within its wide geographical range.

## Care Guide
Carnations thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting their Mediterranean origin. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and provide regular feeding during the growing season for abundant blooms. Ensure good air circulation to prevent disease.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing and flowering season.
