## Introduction
Brosimum is a genus of plants in the family Moraceae, native to tropical regions of the Americas.
The breadnut (B. alicastrum) was used by the Maya civilization for its edible nut. The dense vividly colored scarlet wood of B. rubescens is used for decorative woodworking. B. guianense, or snakewood, has a mottled snake-skin pattern, and is among the densest woods, with a very high stiffness; it was the wood of choice for making of bows for musical instruments of the violin family until the late 18th century, when it was replaced by the more easily worked brazilwood (Paubrasilia echinata). Plants of this genus are otherwise used for timber, building materials, and in a cultural context.
Bufotenin has been identified as a component in the latex of the takini (Brosimum acutifolium) tree, which is used as a psychedelic by South American shamans.

## Care Guide
As a native of tropical rainforests, the Brosimum tree thrives in high humidity and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide bright, ample light, mimicking its natural canopy exposure, and apply moderate fertilization during periods of active growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season, typically once every 2-3 months.
