## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (Maui, Hawaiʻi, Molokai, Lanai) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine to Alpine Shrubland/Grassland on volcanic slopes |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires bright light conditions due to its exposed high-elevation habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Extremely well-draining soil is critical to prevent root rot, mimicking its volcanic native substrate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Geranium is a genus of 422 species of annual, biennial, and perennial plants that are commonly known as geraniums or cranesbills. They are found throughout the temperate regions of the world and the mountains of the tropics, with the greatest diversity in the eastern part of the Mediterranean region.
The palmately cleft leaves are broadly circular in form. The flowers have five petals and are coloured white, pink, purple, or blue, often with distinctive veining. Geraniums will grow in any soil as long as it is not waterlogged. Propagation is by semiripe cuttings in summer, by seed, or by division in autumn or spring.
Geraniums are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, ghost moth, and mouse moth. At least several species of Geranium are gynodioecious. The species Geranium viscosissimum (sticky geranium) is considered to be protocarnivorous.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawaiian Geranium thrives in cool temperatures and bright, direct light, reflecting its subalpine volcanic origin. It demands extremely well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging and requires moderate watering, allowing the substrate to dry thoroughly between applications. Fertilize lightly to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Volcanic soils are typically not rich in organic matter; a balanced, diluted fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
