## Care Guide
This orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical montane forest floor, requiring bright indirect light and consistent moisture without waterlogging. Provide high humidity and a well-draining substrate, feeding lightly during active growth periods for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is required; use a diluted balanced orchid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season, and less frequently or not at all during dormancy.
