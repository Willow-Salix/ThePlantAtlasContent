## 🌱 Overview
Sumac or sumach ( S(H)OO-mak, UK also )—not to be confused with poison sumac—is any of the roughly 35 species of flowering plants in the genus Rhus (and related genera) of the cashew and mango tree family, Anacardiaceae. However, it is Rhus coriaria that is most commonly used for culinary purposes. Sumac is prized as a spice—especially in Iranian cuisine, and other Eastern cuisines—and used as a dye and holistic remedy. The plants grow in subtropical and temperate regions, on nearly every continent except Antarctica and South America.
Native to Persia, it holds cultural significance as a symbolic item on the Haft-sin table during Nowruz, the Persian New Year.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Evergreen Sumac thrives in hot, sunny conditions with well-draining soil, mimicking its native desert environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing to ensure optimal growth and health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to poor, rocky soils and generally does not require fertilization once established.
