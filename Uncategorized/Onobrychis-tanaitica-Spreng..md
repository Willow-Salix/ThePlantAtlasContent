## Introduction
Onobrychis, the sainfoins, are a genus of Eurasian perennial herbaceous plants of the legume family (Fabaceae). About 206 species are presently accepted. The Flora Europaea lists 23 species of Onobrychis; the main centre of diversity extends from Central Asia to Iran, with 56 species – 27 of which are endemic – in the latter country alone. O. viciifolia is naturalized throughout many countries in Europe and North America grasslands on calcareous soils.

## Care Guide
Tanais Sainfoin thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native steppe environment. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering and generally light fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Ensure good drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so high nitrogen fertilizers are generally not required. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring if soil is poor.
