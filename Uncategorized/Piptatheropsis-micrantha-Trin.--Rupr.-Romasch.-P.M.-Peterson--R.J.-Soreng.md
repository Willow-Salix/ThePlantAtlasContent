## Care Guide
Littleseed Ricegrass thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-draining soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, as it is drought-tolerant once established. Minimal fertilizer is required, reflecting its adaptation to leaner native conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to leaner, native soils; heavy fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
