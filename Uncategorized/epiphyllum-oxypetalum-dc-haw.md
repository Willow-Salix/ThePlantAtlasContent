## 🧤 Care Instructions
Epiphyllum oxypetalum, an epiphytic cactus, thrives in bright, indirect light and high humidity, mimicking its tropical forest home. It requires consistent watering during active growth, ensuring the soil dries slightly between waterings, and benefits from well-draining potting medium. Feed sparingly with a diluted liquid fertilizer throughout the growing season.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
In its native habitat, it obtains nutrients from decaying organic matter. Fertilize every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer. Avoid over-fertilizing.
