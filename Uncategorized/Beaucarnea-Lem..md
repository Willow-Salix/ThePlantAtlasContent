| **Native Origin** | Eastern Mexico (Veracruz, San Luis Potosí, Tamaulipas) |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | High light; prefers full sun exposure, can tolerate bright indirect light indoors. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it stores water in its swollen base. Highly drought tolerant. |

## Introduction
Beaucarnea is a genus of flowering plants native to Mexico and Central America. In the APG III classification system, it is placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Convallarioideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae). Beaucarnea is sometimes treated as a synonym of the genus Nolina, with the species being then transferred to that genus. However, recent research shows that Beaucarnea should be treated as an independent genus.
The species are small tropical xerophytic trees growing to 6–10 m tall, with a trunk 20–40 cm diameter with a flared base; young plants are single-stemmed, branching only after flowering. The leaves are evergreen, linear, strap-shaped, 0.5-1.8 m long and 1.5–2 cm broad, leathery in texture, with a finely serrated margin. The flowers are produced only on old trees, forming on large panicles 75–110 cm long, the individual flowers numerous but very small (1.5 mm diameter), greenish-white, with six tepals.

## Care Guide
The Ponytail Palm thrives on neglect, requiring high light and very infrequent watering, allowing its soil to dry out completely between sessions. Fertilization should be minimal, only once or twice during its active growth period, reflecting its natural habitat in nutrient-poor, arid regions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring and summer) is sufficient due to its native nutrient-poor soils.
