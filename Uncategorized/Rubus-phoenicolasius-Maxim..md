## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Asia (China, Japan, Korea) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest Edge |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal fruit production, but tolerates some afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture. Requires regular watering, especially during dry spells and fruit development, to keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged. Mimics the consistent rainfall of its native temperate habitat. |

## Introduction
Rubus is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, subfamily Rosoideae, most commonly known as brambles. Fruits of various species are known as raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, and bristleberries. It is a diverse genus, with the estimated number of Rubus species varying from 250 to over 1000, found across all continents except Antarctica.
Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles like roses; spines, bristles, and gland-tipped hairs are also common in the genus. The Rubus fruit, sometimes called a bramble fruit, is an aggregate of drupelets. The term cane fruit or cane berry applies to any Rubus species or hybrid which is commonly grown with supports such as wires or canes, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry. The stems of such plants are also referred to as canes.

## Care Guide
The Wine Raspberry thrives in conditions mimicking its native East Asian temperate forest edges, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular watering during dry periods is crucial, with moderate annual fertilization to support vigorous growth and abundant fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Thrives in moderately rich, well-drained soils. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is generally sufficient, as it's not overly demanding.
