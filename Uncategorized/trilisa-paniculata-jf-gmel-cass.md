## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in bright, open conditions, mimicking its native subtropical pine savannas. Provide moderate water during the growing season, ensuring well-drained soil. Fertilization should be minimal, given its adaptation to less fertile environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. A light application of balanced fertilizer during the growing season may be beneficial.
