## Introduction
Lactuca, commonly known as lettuce, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The genus includes at least 50 species, distributed worldwide, but mainly in temperate Eurasia.
Its best-known representative is the garden lettuce (Lactuca sativa), with its many varieties. "Wild lettuce" commonly refers to the wild-growing relatives of common garden lettuce. Many species are common weeds. Lactuca species are diverse and take a wide variety of forms. They are annuals, biennials, perennials, or shrubs. Their flower heads have yellow, blue, or white ray florets. Some species are bitter-tasting.
Most wild lettuces are xerophytes, adapted to dry habitat types. Some occur in more moist areas, such as the mountains of central Africa.

## Care Guide
Woodland Lettuce thrives in partial shade to full sun, preferring consistent moisture and well-draining soil rich in organic matter. Mimicking its native temperate woodland environment, ensure it receives regular watering and moderate fertility for healthy growth, avoiding waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility; thrives in average, well-draining soil, ideally enriched with organic matter. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer, as it's not a heavy feeder.
