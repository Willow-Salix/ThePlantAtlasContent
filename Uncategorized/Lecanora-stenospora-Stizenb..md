## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
This resilient lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions. It requires very infrequent watering, relying primarily on atmospheric moisture and can tolerate long periods of desiccation. Traditional fertilization is not necessary.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens do not require traditional fertilization; they absorb trace nutrients from the air and the substrate on which they grow.
