## Introduction
Asclepias incarnata, the swamp milkweed, rose milkweed, rose milkflower, swamp silkweed, or white Indian hemp, is a herbaceous perennial plant species native to North America. It grows in damp through wet soils and also is cultivated as a garden plant for its flowers, which attract butterflies and other pollinators with nectar. Like most other milkweeds, it has latex containing toxic steroids, a characteristic that repels many species of insects and mammals.

## Care Guide
Swamp Milkweed thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native wetland habitat. It prefers moderate soil fertility and generally needs frequent watering, especially if not planted in a naturally damp location. This plant is crucial for monarch butterfly larvae and typically requires minimal care once established.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; thrives in average to rich soil, supplemental fertilization is usually not necessary if soil is amended with compost
