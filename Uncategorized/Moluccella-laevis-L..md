## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Turkey, Syria, and the Caucasus region (Western Asia) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean to semi-arid climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) for best flowering, tolerates light afternoon shade in very hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, keeping soil consistently moist but not waterlogged during the growing season. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. Established plants are moderately drought tolerant. |

## Introduction
Moluccella laevis, the Bells-of-Ireland, Bells of Ireland, Molucca balmis, shellflower or shell flower, is a summer flowering annual, native to Turkey, Syria and the Caucasus. It is cultivated for its spikes of flowers. In the language of flowers, it represents luck.
The tiny white flowers are surrounded by apple green calyces which are persistent. The rounded leaves are pale green.
Fast growing, Moluccella laevis will reach 1 metre (3.28 feet) and spread to 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) with an erect, branching habit.
A member of the mint family, the blooming stems can be cut and used in fresh or dried flower arrangements.  The domestic plant is self-seeding, prefers full sun and regular water and is unlikely to do well in hot, humid climates.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Bells of Ireland require full sun and well-draining soil, similar to their native Mediterranean habitat. Ensure consistent moisture during their active growth cycle, allowing brief drying between waterings, and fertilize lightly to promote robust flowering.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Amend soil with compost at planting. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer can be applied monthly at half strength during the active growing season, but avoid over-fertilization.
