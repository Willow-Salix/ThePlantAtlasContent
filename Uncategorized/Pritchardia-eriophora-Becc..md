| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Oʻahu, Hawaiian Islands |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Dry Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers bright, direct light for optimal growth, especially as a mature plant. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering is needed, allowing the topsoil to dry out slightly between waterings. Established plants have moderate drought tolerance, but consistent moisture is best during active growth. |

## Introduction
The genus Pritchardia (family Arecaceae) consists of between 24 and 40 species of fan palms (subfamily Coryphoideae) found on tropical Pacific Ocean islands in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Tuamotus, and most diversely in Hawaii. The generic name honors William Thomas Pritchard (1829–1907), a British consul at Fiji.

## Care Guide
The Kāwa'u palm, native to Oʻahu's dryland forests, thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering during its active growth period, allowing for slight drying between applications. It benefits from moderate fertilization to support its growth in cultivation, mimicking the nutrient availability of its natural habitat.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Apply a balanced, slow-release palm fertilizer 2-3 times during the growing season (spring to early autumn).
