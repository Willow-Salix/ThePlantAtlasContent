## Care Guide
Phalaris velutina requires full to partial sun exposure and moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry between waterings. It is well-adapted to drier conditions once established and benefits from low to moderate fertilization during active growth. This resilient grass thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean and semi-arid environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, particularly during its active growth period, typically in cooler months.
