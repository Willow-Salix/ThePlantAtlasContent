## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Subarctic regions, including parts of North America (e.g., Canada, Greenland), Northern Europe, and Northern Asia. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, treeless tundra habitat with high light exposure during the short growing season. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture, especially during the short growing season (spring/summer), but requires excellent drainage to mimic well-drained tundra soils and prevent root rot. Avoid prolonged waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and cool conditions, mirroring its native tundra habitat. Ensure consistent soil moisture during the growing season while providing excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Fertilize sparingly as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Tundra soils are typically shallow, acidic, and nutrient-poor, so a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost once in early spring is generally sufficient.
