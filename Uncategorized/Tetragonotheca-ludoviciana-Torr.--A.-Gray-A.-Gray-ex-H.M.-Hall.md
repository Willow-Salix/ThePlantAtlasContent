## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in open woodlands, pine forests, prairies, and sandy disturbed areas) |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial sun, thriving in locations with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. Tolerates some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering, especially when establishing. Once mature, it is somewhat drought-tolerant but benefits from consistent moisture in well-draining soil. Allow soil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in sunny, well-draining locations typical of its native humid subtropical environment. Provide moderate water, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and use fertilizer sparingly to emulate its natural habitat. Its robust nature makes it relatively low-maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. If planted in poor soil, a light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring may be beneficial. Avoid over-fertilizing as this plant is adapted to moderate-to-low nutrient conditions.
