## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Island of Hawaii (Big Island), Hawaii, USA, specifically the Kaʻū district. |
| **Climate** | Subalpine/Alpine Dry Shrubland/Grassland on volcanic substrates. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily). Requires very high light intensity, reflecting its open, high-elevation habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot, mimicking its adaptation to well-drained volcanic soils. |

## Introduction
The Mauna Loa silversword, Argyroxiphium kauense, or Kaʻū silversword, is a rare species of flowering plant in the aster family. It is endemic to the eastern and southern slopes of Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaiʻi. A. kauense occurs in mountainous shrublands, bogs, and open mesic forest. The species is managed by the National Park Service and Hawaiʻi State Department of Forestry and Wildlife. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States. There are three known populations remaining, for a total of fewer than 1000 individuals.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full, intense sun and requires very well-draining soil, mimicking its native high-elevation volcanic habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry completely, and apply fertilizer very rarely due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. Use a very diluted, balanced fertilizer sparingly, perhaps once a year, or avoid if grown in suitable substrate. Native volcanic soils are typically nutrient-poor.
