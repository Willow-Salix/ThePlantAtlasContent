## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This sedge flourishes in cool, alpine or subarctic conditions. Provide full to partial sun exposure and maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil. Fertilization should be minimal, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor native environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils found in alpine and subarctic environments, so minimal or no fertilization is generally required.
