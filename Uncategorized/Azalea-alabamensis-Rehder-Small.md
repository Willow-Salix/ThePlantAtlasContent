## Introduction
Azaleas ( ə-ZAY-lee-ə) are flowering  shrubs in the genus Rhododendron, particularly the former  sections Tsutsusi (evergreen) and Pentanthera (deciduous). Azaleas bloom in the spring (April and May in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, and October and November in the Southern Hemisphere), their flowers often lasting several weeks. Shade tolerant, they prefer living near or under trees. They are part of the family Ericaceae.

## Care Guide
This azalea thrives in conditions mimicking its native humid subtropical woodlands, requiring partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained acidic soil. Regular watering, especially during dry periods, and a light application of acid-loving fertilizer in spring will promote healthy growth and abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Apply an acid-loving fertilizer sparingly in early spring, tailored for azaleas and rhododendrons.
