## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Burrawong thrives in conditions mimicking its native Australian woodlands, preferring full sun to partial shade. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and fertilize sparingly with a low-phosphorus, slow-release product. This resilient plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and irregular rainfall.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer sparingly (once or twice a year) during the growing season. Over-fertilization, especially with phosphorus, can be detrimental.
