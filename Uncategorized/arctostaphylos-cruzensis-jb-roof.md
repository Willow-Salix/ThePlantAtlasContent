## 🌱 Overview
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
La Cruz manzanita thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean scrubland environment. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, especially in warmer months. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs. These plants are adapted to nutrient-poor soils; avoid heavy fertilization. A light application of a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer in fall may be beneficial if growth is sluggish.
