## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America, including New England and the Appalachian Mountains of the USA and Canada |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool-temperate, humid forest environments within the Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests biome |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect to low light. Thrives under a forest canopy, protected from direct, intense sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | High humidity and frequent moisture from rainfall or mist are essential, as lichens absorb water directly from the environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ochrolechia is the sole genus in the fungal family Ochrolechiaceae. It comprises about 40 species of crustose lichens. These lichens typically form uneven, often thick, crust-like growths on various surfaces and are characterised by their white to pale grey thalli, which may have a greenish tint. The genus has a long evolutionary history, with fossils dating back to the Paleogene period, about 34 million years ago. Ochrolechia species have disc-like apothecia (fruiting bodies), which are usually yellowish or brownish-pink and often covered with a fine white powdery coating. The genus is widely distributed and includes both common and rare species, with some found in extreme environments such as arctic and alpine regions. Ochrolechia lichens produce diverse secondary metabolites, including orcinol depsides, depsidones, and xanthones.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen requires a cool, highly humid environment with indirect light, mimicking its native forest habitat. Consistent environmental moisture is critical for its survival, as it absorbs water and nutrients directly from the air, rendering traditional watering and fertilization unnecessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens derive all necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate (tree bark) and do not require traditional fertilization.
