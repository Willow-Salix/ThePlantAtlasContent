## Introduction
Pickeringia is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It was recently assigned to the unranked, monophyletic Cladrastis clade. It was named after the naturalist Charles Pickering. Its only species is Pickeringia montana, which is known by the common name chaparral pea. It is native to California, where its distribution extends along the Coast Ranges and the Sierra Nevada foothills, as well as the Peninsular Ranges of Southern California and northern Baja California. It is also known from Santa Cruz Island.
It is one of very few legumes native to the chaparral habitat. Its nitrogen-fixing ability helps it thrive in rocky, sandy soil. The plant is also well-suited to a landscape of hills, slopes, and recently burned areas; its roots spread quickly and help anchor loose soil, preventing erosion.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean scrubland habitat. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires very little water, especially during its dormant dry season. Avoid excessive fertilization to ensure healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low; native soils are typically lean. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
