## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (primarily California, Oregon, Washington, Baja California) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (chaparral, oak woodlands, open conifer forests, rocky hillsides) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Can tolerate some morning sun, but avoid harsh afternoon sun exposure. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out almost completely between waterings. Water thoroughly, then ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Pentagramma is a small genus of North American ferns in the family Pteridaceae. Until 1990 members of this genus were included in Pityrogramma, and there has been considerable disagreement regarding the species' taxonomy. In the most recent treatment, six diploid species are recognized.
The distribution of P. triangularis (goldback fern) extends from British Columbia through the western United States into Baja California in northwestern Mexico. Pentagramma maxonii occurs in New Mexico, Arizona, Sonora, Baja California Sur, California, and Baja California. All other species are restricted to California and Baja California.
Members of the genus Pentagramma produce a powdery-waxy secretion on their lower leaf surfaces, called farina. This character is shared with the related genus Notholaenaand other members of the Cheilanthoideae.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant fern thrives in bright indirect light to partial shade, appreciating well-draining soil. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the substrate to dry out significantly between sessions to mimic its native Mediterranean climate. Fertilization needs are low, making it a relatively low-maintenance option for those seeking a unique fern.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. A diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season (spring/summer) is sufficient, or it may not be needed at all.
