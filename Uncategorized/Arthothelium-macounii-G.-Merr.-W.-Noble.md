## Care Guide
Macoun's arthothelium lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with filtered light, typical of the Pacific Northwest temperate rainforest. Maintaining very high humidity and consistent moisture is paramount, while traditional fertilization is unnecessary and should be avoided.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required. Lichens derive nutrients from the air and rain; standard fertilizers would be detrimental.
