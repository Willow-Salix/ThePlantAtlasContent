## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically montane regions of the southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Forest. Characterized by distinct seasons, cold snowy winters, moderate summers, and often moist conditions along stream banks or in woodland understories. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Shade to Full Sun. Thrives in partial shade, especially in warmer climates, but can tolerate full sun in cooler, high-elevation environments with consistent moisture. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist. Requires regular watering to keep the soil moist, especially during dry periods; does not tolerate prolonged drought. |

## Introduction
Thalictrum ( ) is a genus of 120-200 species of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae, native mostly to temperate regions. Meadow-rue is a common name for plants in this genus.
Thalictrum is a taxonomically difficult genus with poorly understood species boundaries; it is in need of further taxonomic and field research for clarification.
Despite their common name of "meadow-rue", Thalictrum species are not closely related to the true rue (family Rutaceae), but resemble its members in having compound leaves twice or thrice divided.

## Care Guide
Fendler's Meadow-rue prefers consistently moist, rich, organic soil in partial shade to full sun, mirroring its native montane woodland habitat. Regular watering and an annual application of compost or a balanced fertilizer will support its healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from rich, organic soil. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or compost can be applied annually in spring.
