## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | High-altitude regions of China, including Qinghai, Sichuan, Tibet, Yunnan, Gansu, and Xinjiang. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine zones, characterized by cold winters, distinct seasons, and often proximity to water sources like rivers and ravines. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in open, high-altitude environments with strong light exposure, such as alpine meadows and mountain slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist soil; native habitats along riverbanks and ravines indicate a need for regular, ample watering, particularly during the growing season. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This high-altitude willow thrives in full to partial sun with a strong preference for consistently moist soil, mimicking its native riverbank and alpine meadow habitats. It benefits from regular watering and moderate, balanced fertilization during its active growth period to ensure robust health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied during the growing season is generally sufficient, supporting growth without requiring exceptionally rich soil.
