## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | East Asia (China, Japan, Korea) and the Himalayas (India, Nepal, Bhutan) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to full sun. Tolerates full sun in cooler climates, but benefits from afternoon shade in hotter regions, mimicking its growth in forest margins or clearings. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil. Requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, to replicate the rainfall patterns of its native forest habitats, but avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Phytolacca is a genus of perennial plants native to North America, South America and East Asia. Some members of the genus are known as pokeweeds or similar names such as pokebush, pokeberry, pokeroot or poke sallet. Other names for species of Phytolacca include inkberry and ombú. The generic name is derived from the Greek word φυτόν (phyton), meaning "plant," and the Latin word lacca, a red dye. Phytolaccatoxin and phytolaccagenin are present (in the leaves, stems, roots, blossoms, berries etc.) in many species which are poisonous to mammals if not prepared properly. The berries are eaten by birds, which are not affected by the toxin. The small seeds with very hard outer shells remain intact in the digestive system and are eliminated whole.
The genus comprises about 25 to 35 species of perennial herbs, shrubs, and trees growing from 1 to 25 m (3 to 80 ft) tall. They have alternate simple leaves, pointed at the end, with entire or crinkled margins; the leaves can be either deciduous or evergreen. The stems are green, pink or red. The flowers are greenish-white to pink, produced in long racemes at the ends of the stems. They develop into globose berries 4 to 12 millimetres (0.2 to 0.5 in) diameter, green at first, ripening dark purple to black.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable plant thrives in partial shade to full sun, preferring consistently moist, well-draining soil. It benefits from moderate fertilization, reflecting its origins in temperate to subtropical forest environments and disturbed areas. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry periods, to support its vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from an annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer, particularly in infertile soils, reflecting the nutrient cycling in forest environments.
