## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California Channel Islands, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily). |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growing season (typically late winter to spring); allow soil to dry out between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal to no water during summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Phacelia (phacelia, scorpionweed, heliotrope) is a genus of about 200 species of annual or perennial herbaceous plants in the borage family, native to North and South America. California is particularly rich in species with over 90 recorded in the region.
The genus is traditionally placed at family rank with the waterleafs (Hydrophyllaceae) in the order Boraginales. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, recognizing that the traditional Boraginaceae and Hydrophyllaceae are paraphyletic with respect to each other, merges the latter into the former and considers the family basal in the Euasterids I clade. Other botanists continue to recognize the Hydrophyllaceae and Boraginales after analysing the secondary structure of the ITS1 genetic region rather than its sequence for these higher taxonomic levels.  This placed Phacelia within the Hydrophyllaceae. Further molecular taxonomic analysis of the Boraginales has divided the Boraginales in two and placed Phacelia among the monophyletic herbaceous Hydrophyllaceae in Boraginales II.
The genus includes both annual and perennial species. Many have been cultivated as garden and honey plants.
There are reports that glandular hairs of stems, flowers and leaves of some species of Phacelia secrete oil droplets that can cause an unpleasant skin rash (contact dermatitis) in some people, specifically from P. brachyloba, P. campanularia, P. crenulata, P. gina-glenneae, P. grandiflora, P. ixodes, P. minor, and P. pedicellata. The major contact allergen of P. crenulata has been identified as geranylhydroquinone and of P. minor as geranylgeranylhydroquinone.
The mining bee Andrena phaceliae is a specialist pollinator of this genus in the Eastern United States.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, adapting well to its native Mediterranean climate. Provide moderate water during its active growth in cooler months, then significantly reduce watering as temperatures rise and the plant goes dormant. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. If soils are very poor, a very light, balanced granular fertilizer can be applied once at the start of the growing season.
