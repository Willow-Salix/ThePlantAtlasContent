## Introduction
Crepis, commonly known in some parts of the world as hawksbeard or hawk's-beard (but not to be confused with the related genus Hieracium with a similar common name), is a genus of annual and perennial flowering plants of the family Asteraceae superficially resembling the dandelion, the most conspicuous difference being that Crepis usually has branching scapes with multiple heads (though solitary heads can occur). The genus name Crepis derives from the Greek krepis, meaning "slipper" or "sandal", possibly in reference to the shape of the fruit.
The genus is distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and Africa, and several plants are known as introduced species practically worldwide. The center of diversity is in the Mediterranean.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, reflecting its native habitat in temperate grasslands and open woodlands. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing as it tolerates poorer soil conditions. Overall, it is a low-maintenance species.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; this plant thrives in poor to average soils and does not require rich fertilization.
