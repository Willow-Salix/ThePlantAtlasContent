## 🧤 Care Instructions
Solidago aspera, the Rough-stemmed Goldenrod, is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and dry to medium-dry conditions. It is well-suited for poor, well-drained soils and requires minimal watering or fertilization once established, making it ideal for naturalized areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none, typically found in nutrient-poor or disturbed soils and does not require additional fertilization; excessive fertilizer may lead to leggy growth.
