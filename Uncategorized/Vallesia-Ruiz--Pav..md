## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical Americas, including Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Dry Forests, and Coastal Scrublands. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating high light exposure typical of open scrublands and forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring less water during cooler or dry periods. |

## Care Guide
Vallesia thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical and subtropical dry forests and coastal scrublands. Provide full sun to partial shade and allow the soil to dry out between waterings, reducing frequency during dormancy. Fertilize lightly during the active growing season.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer). Native soils in these biomes are not typically exceptionally rich.
