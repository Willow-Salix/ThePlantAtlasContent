## Introduction
Rinodina is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 265 species. It is hypothesized that a few saxicolous species common to dry regions of western North America, southern Europe, North Africa and central Asia may date back 240 million years to the Middle Triassic.

## Care Guide
Rinodina roscida thrives in cool, humid environments with filtered light, typical of temperate and boreal forests. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture and clean air, absorbing nutrients directly from its surroundings without the need for traditional fertilizers. Ensure it has a stable, suitable substrate like tree bark.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required; this lichen obtains all necessary nutrients directly from clean air and rainfall.
