## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern Brazil, Uruguay, northeastern Argentina, Paraguay |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Dry Forests, Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright indirect light is ideal. As it originates from open, sun-drenched landscapes, it thrives with significant light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Reflecting its arid native environment, it requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water heavily during the growing season (spring/summer) but reduce significantly during cooler, dormant months. |

## Introduction
Cereus repandus (syn. Cereus peruvianus), the Peruvian apple cactus, is a large, erect, spiny columnar cactus found in South America. It is also known as giant club cactus, hedge cactus, cadushi (in Papiamento and Wayuunaiki), and kayush.
Cereus repandus is grown mostly as an ornamental plant, but has some local culinary importance. The Wayuu from the La Guajira Peninsula of Colombia and Venezuela also use the inner cane-like wood of the plant in wattle and daub construction.

## Care Guide
This cactus thrives in environments mimicking its native subtropical dry regions, requiring ample sunlight and infrequent watering to prevent rot. Allow the soil to thoroughly dry between waterings, especially outside of its active growing season. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted, balanced formula during warm months.

### Fertilizer
Native soils are often nutrient-poor, so it benefits from infrequent feeding. A balanced, low-nitrogen liquid fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
