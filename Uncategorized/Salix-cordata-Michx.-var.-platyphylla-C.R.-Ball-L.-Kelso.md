## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (specifically parts of the United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Riparian Zones, Wetlands, and Moist Open Areas |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. As a pioneer species in open, moist areas, it tolerates high sun exposure. |
| **Watering** | High. This willow thrives in consistently moist to wet soils, often found along stream banks, pond margins, and in wetlands, indicating a need for regular and abundant water. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This willow requires full sun to partial shade and consistently wet to moist soil, mirroring its native riparian habitat. Regular watering is crucial, especially during dry periods, to prevent stress. It tolerates average soil but will benefit from a moderate fertilization regimen.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Thrives in average to rich, well-draining soil. While not heavy feeders, a balanced all-purpose fertilizer can support robust growth, especially in poorer soils.
