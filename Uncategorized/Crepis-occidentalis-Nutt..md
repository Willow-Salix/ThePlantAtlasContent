## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including areas from British Columbia south to California, and east to the Rocky Mountains (e.g., Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, Washington). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Semi-Arid Grassland and Montane Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun exposure, mimicking its open, unshaded native habitats on dry slopes and grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant; requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering should be avoided. |

## Introduction
Crepis, commonly known in some parts of the world as hawksbeard or hawk's-beard (but not to be confused with the related genus Hieracium with a similar common name), is a genus of annual and perennial flowering plants of the family Asteraceae superficially resembling the dandelion, the most conspicuous difference being that Crepis usually has branching scapes with multiple heads (though solitary heads can occur). The genus name Crepis derives from the Greek krepis, meaning "slipper" or "sandal", possibly in reference to the shape of the fruit.
The genus is distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and Africa, and several plants are known as introduced species practically worldwide. The center of diversity is in the Mediterranean.

## Care Guide
Largeflower Hawksbeard is a low-maintenance plant adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Provide full sun and well-drained, lean soil, and water sparingly, allowing it to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid over-fertilization, as it thrives in nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Adapted to lean, often rocky soils; generally requires no fertilizer. If soil is exceptionally poor, a very light, balanced application in spring may be beneficial but is often unnecessary.
