## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread globally, particularly common across temperate regions of Europe, North America, and Asia, often found in urban and disturbed environments. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate |
| **☀️ Light** | Thrives in high light conditions, including full sun exposure, typical of open rock surfaces, walls, and pavements. |
| **💧 Water** | Obtains moisture directly from rainfall, dew, and atmospheric humidity. It is highly desiccation-tolerant and does not require watering; avoid constant saturation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Rim Lichen is a resilient, self-sufficient organism adapted to temperate climates and exposed conditions. Optimal 'care' involves placing it on a suitable, stable substrate in an area with high light, allowing natural precipitation and atmospheric moisture to sustain it without additional watering or fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers. It derives all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and rainwater; high nutrient levels can be detrimental.
