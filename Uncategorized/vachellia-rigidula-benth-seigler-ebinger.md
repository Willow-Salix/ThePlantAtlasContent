## 🧤 Care Instructions
Blackbrush acacia thrives on neglect, requiring full sun and infrequent watering to mimic its arid native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to lean soils, thus fertilization is rarely, if ever, needed. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in lean, poor soils and does not require frequent fertilization. Over-fertilizing can be detrimental.
