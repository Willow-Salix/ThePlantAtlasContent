## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest, often in moist or wetland areas |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to deep shade. As a moss typically found on forest floors, decaying wood, or shaded rocks, it cannot tolerate direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | High and consistent moisture. The substrate must be kept constantly damp, but not waterlogged. High humidity is crucial, often requiring frequent misting or cultivation in a terrarium-like environment. |

## Care Guide
This moss requires consistently moist conditions, high humidity, and low light, replicating its native temperate forest and wetland habitats. Ensure the substrate is always damp, avoid direct sun, and provide minimal to no fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses thrive in nutrient-poor environments and do not require significant fertilization. If used, apply a very diluted solution sparingly.
