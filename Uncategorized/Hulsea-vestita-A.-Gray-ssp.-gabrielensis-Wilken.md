## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | San Gabriel Mountains and other high ranges of Southern California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Montane (characterized by dry, hot summers and cool, wet winters, with high sun exposure at elevation) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat on open, exposed, rocky slopes. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Requires excellent drainage and tolerates dry conditions once established. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in summer. |

## Introduction
Hulsea is a small genus of North American flowering plants in the family Asteraceae known commonly as alpinegold.
Alpinegolds are annual or perennial herbs native to western North America. They produce stout erect stems which may be fuzzy, hairy, or quite woolly. They are leafy, especially toward the base of the stem. At the top of the stem, they bear small daisylike flower heads, with ray florets in shades of yellow to reddish-orange around a center packed with disc florets. The fruits are generally hard and black with a pappus.

## Care Guide
Pumice Alpinegold thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, typical of its native Mediterranean montane habitat. It requires infrequent watering, adapting to dry summer conditions, and benefits from minimal to no fertilization to mimic its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor, lean, well-draining soils. No or very minimal fertilization is typically required, as rich soils can be detrimental.
