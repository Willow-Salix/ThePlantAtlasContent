## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, Arizona, and New Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, especially afternoon shade in hotter climates to prevent scorching. Prefers bright, open conditions. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil is crucial, but excellent drainage is equally important to prevent root rot. Mimic its native habitat of moist, rocky slopes and streambanks. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Mountain Saxifrage requires bright light (with some afternoon shade in warm areas) and consistently moist, exceptionally well-drained soil. Over-fertilization should be avoided, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky environments. Mimicking its cool, high-altitude native conditions is key to its success.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer is needed. Alpine plants are adapted to lean soils; excessive nutrients can be detrimental. If desired, use a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once early in the growing season.
