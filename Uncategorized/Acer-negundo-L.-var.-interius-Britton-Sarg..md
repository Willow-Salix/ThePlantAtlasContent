## Introduction
Acer negundo, also known as the box elder, boxelder maple, Manitoba maple or ash-leaved maple, is a species of maple native to North America from Canada to Honduras. It is a fast-growing, short-lived tree with opposite, ash-like compound leaves. It is sometimes considered a weedy or invasive species, and has been naturalized throughout much of the world, including South America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, much of Europe, and parts of Asia.

## Care Guide
The Boxelder thrives in temperate regions with full sun to partial shade, favoring consistently moist soil conditions mimicking its native riparian habitats. It is adaptable to various soil types and moderate fertility, though regular watering is key, especially during establishment.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from average soil fertility. Generally not a heavy feeder, but a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can support growth in nutrient-poor soils.
