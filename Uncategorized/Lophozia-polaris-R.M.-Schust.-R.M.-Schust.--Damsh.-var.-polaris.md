## Care Guide
This arctic liverwort thrives in consistently cool temperatures, high humidity, and a constantly moist, well-draining substrate. It requires low to moderate indirect light and should receive minimal to no fertilizer to mimic its nutrient-poor native environment.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; if applied, use extremely dilute solutions very infrequently, as tundra soils are nutrient-poor.
