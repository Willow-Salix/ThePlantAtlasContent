## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Southwestern United States, Mexico), parts of Europe |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | High direct sun exposure, tolerates intense light for prolonged periods, typically growing on exposed rocks. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent watering. Thrives in dry conditions, absorbing moisture from occasional rain, dew, or atmospheric humidity. Requires long dry periods between any moisture. |

## Introduction
Acarospora is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Acarosporaceae. Most species in the genus are crustose lichens that grow on rocks in open and arid places all over the world. They may look like a cobblestone road or cracked up old paint, and are commonly called cobblestone lichens or cracked lichens. They usually grow on rock (are "saxicolous"), but some grow on soil (terricolous) or on other lichens. Some species in the genus are fungi that live as parasites on other lichens (lichenicolous fungi). Acarospora is a widely distributed genus, with about 128 species according to a 2008 estimate.
Species in Acarospora may be shiny as if covered with a glossy varnish, or dull and powdery looking. They have a diverse range of colors, from the brilliant yellow bright cobblestone lichen, to the dark reddish-brown mountain cobblestone lichen, or they can appear tan, gray, or white, from a dusty-looking coating (pruina). They may grow in crustose forms like a warty surface (verrucose), like cracking-up old crust of paint (rimose), like a bunch of "islands" in a dry lake bed (areolate), like the flakes of cracking up paint are peeling up at the edges (sub-squamulous), or like the flakes are growing over others like scales (squamulous).

## Care Guide
This crustose lichen requires high direct sun exposure and very infrequent watering, adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives on dry, exposed rocks and needs no supplemental fertilizer, obtaining nutrients naturally from its surroundings.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air and the substrate they grow on, making supplemental feeding unnecessary and potentially harmful.
