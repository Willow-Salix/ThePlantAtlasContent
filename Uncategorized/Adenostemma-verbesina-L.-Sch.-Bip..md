## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Americas (Mexico to Argentina, and Caribbean) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest / Rainforest edges |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. In its native habitat, it thrives at the edges of forests or in clearings, receiving filtered sun or direct morning sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil. Water frequently, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly between waterings to mimic its native preference for moist but not waterlogged conditions along streams and disturbed areas. |

## Care Guide
This tropical plant thrives in conditions that mimic its native rainforest edge environment, requiring bright indirect light and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide regular watering and moderate fertilization during its active growing season to support robust growth and vitality, adapting to its preference for humid conditions.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, typical for plants found in organically rich, yet sometimes nutrient-leached, tropical soils.
