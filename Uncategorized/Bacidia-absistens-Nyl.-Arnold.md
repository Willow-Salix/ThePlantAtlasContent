## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe and North America |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light; thrives in shaded or dappled light conditions under a forest canopy, avoiding direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity and regular moisture from misting or precipitation; does not require traditional 'watering' of a substrate. |

## Introduction
Bacidia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. These lichens are characterised by their crustose growth form, distinctive club-shaped reproductive structures called apothecia that contain long, needle-like spores, and their symbiotic partnership with green algae. Bacidia species typically grow on various substrates including tree bark, rock surfaces, and occasionally soil, and are distinguished from related genera by their specific spore characteristics and internal structures.

## Care Guide
As a lichen, Bacidia absistens thrives in cool temperate forest environments, needing high atmospheric humidity and indirect light. It absorbs moisture directly from the air and precipitation, making regular misting or placement in a humid setting crucial. Traditional plant care like soil watering or fertilization is not applicable and can be harmful.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required or beneficial; obtains necessary nutrients passively from the atmosphere and dissolved minerals in rainfall.
