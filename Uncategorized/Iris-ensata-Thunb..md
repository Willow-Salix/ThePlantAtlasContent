## Introduction
The term "Japanese iris" encompasses three species of Irises cultivated in gardens or growing wild in Japan: hanashōbu (Iris ensata), kakitsubata (Iris laevigata) and ayame (Iris sanguinea). Of these three species, I. ensata is the one most commonly referred to as "Japanese iris" outside Japan. 
The bluish purple color of the flowers of the Japanese garden iris is an example of the copigmentation phenomenon.

## Care Guide
Japanese Irises thrive in full sun and require consistently moist to wet soil, reflecting their native wetland habitat. They prefer slightly acidic conditions and benefit from moderate, low-phosphorus fertilization to support their vibrant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a low-phosphorus, balanced fertilizer in early spring; prefers slightly acidic soil conditions.
