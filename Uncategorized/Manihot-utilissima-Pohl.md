## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical South America (specifically Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and tuber development. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture during active growth but is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent waterlogging and root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Manihot esculenta, commonly called cassava, manioc, or yuca (among numerous regional names), is a woody shrub of the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, native to South America, from Brazil, Paraguay and parts of the Andes. Although a perennial plant, cassava is extensively cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as an annual crop for its edible starchy tuberous root. Cassava is predominantly consumed in boiled form, but substantial quantities are processed to extract cassava starch, called tapioca, which is used for food, animal feed, and industrial purposes. The Brazilian farofa, and the related garri of West Africa, is an edible coarse flour obtained by grating cassava roots, pressing moisture off the obtained grated pulp, and finally drying and roasting it.
Cassava is the third-largest source of carbohydrates in food in the tropics, after rice and maize, making it an important staple; more than 500 million people depend on it. It offers the advantage of being exceptionally drought-tolerant, and able to grow productively on poor soil. The largest producer is Nigeria, while Thailand is the largest exporter of cassava starch.
Cassava is grown in sweet and bitter varieties; both contain toxins, but the bitter varieties have them in much larger amounts. Cassava has to be prepared carefully for consumption, as improperly prepared material can contain sufficient cyanide to cause poisoning. The more toxic varieties of cassava have been used in some places as famine food during times of food insecurity. Farmers may however choose bitter cultivars to minimise crop losses.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cassava, originating from tropical South American lowlands, thrives in full sun and needs consistent moisture during its growing period, though it can withstand some drought. It is a heavy feeder, performing best with regular fertilization, especially potassium, to support its vigorous growth and significant tuber yield.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from regular fertilization, particularly with potassium, due to its rapid growth and high nutrient demands for tuber production; it is considered a heavy feeder.
