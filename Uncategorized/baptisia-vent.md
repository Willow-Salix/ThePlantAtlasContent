## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wild Indigo thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil typical of temperate grasslands. Establish with regular watering, then enjoy its drought tolerance and minimal need for fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. It is a low-maintenance plant once mature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a member of the Fabaceae family, Baptisia fixes nitrogen into the soil and generally requires little to no supplemental fertilization. It can tolerate average to poor soils.
