## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate to Alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America, often on exposed siliceous rocks. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane and Alpine Zones, specifically on exposed rock outcrops. |
| **Sunlight** | High light to full sun, typical of exposed rock faces with minimal shade. |
| **Watering** | Primarily moisture from rain, dew, or fog; highly tolerant of desiccation. Requires excellent air circulation and no traditional watering, as prolonged wetness without airflow is detrimental. |

## Introduction
Muellerella is a genus of lichenicolous lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in northern temperate areas, and contains species that live on other lichens, or on liverworts.
Molecular phylogenetic analysis published in 2019 indicates that the genus, as currently circumscribed, is polyphyletic. M. atricola and M. lichenicola form one monophyletic lineage in the genus, but the rest of the species tested fell into two distinct monophyletic lineages. The authors suggest the placement of the genus within the subclass Chaetothyriomycetidae, but acknowledge that more genetic analysis is required to determine the correct placement of the type species, Muellerella polyspora.

## Care Guide
Cultivating this rock-dwelling lichen is challenging and generally not recommended outside its natural habitat. It thrives on exposed, siliceous rocks in temperate to alpine climates, requiring high light and intermittent moisture from environmental sources. Avoid traditional watering and fertilization, as these conditions are detrimental to its survival and natural growth.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to no fertilizer requirements; highly sensitive to excess nutrients, especially nitrogen, which can inhibit growth or cause damage.
