## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (primarily Nevada, with occurrences in eastern California and northwestern Arizona) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun; requires direct, intense sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily, consistent with open desert environments. |
| **Watering** | Low to very low; highly drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Psorothamnus is a genus of plants in the legume family. These are shrubs and small trees. Many are known by the general common name indigo bush. Some are referred to as daleas, as this genus was once included in genus Dalea. These are generally thorny, thickly branched, strongly scented bushes. Most species bear lupinlike raceme inflorescences of bright purple legume flowers and gland-rich pods. Psorothamnus species are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.
The genus formerly included additional species, but was found to be paraphyletic, and genus Psorodendron was reinstated to accommodate sections Xylodalea, Capnodendron, and Winnemucca.

## Care Guide
King's Dalea thrives in conditions similar to its native arid scrubland and desert habitat. Provide abundant full sun and extremely infrequent, deep watering once established, as it is highly drought-tolerant. It prefers lean, well-draining soils and does not require fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none; adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy, or gravelly desert soils. Fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
