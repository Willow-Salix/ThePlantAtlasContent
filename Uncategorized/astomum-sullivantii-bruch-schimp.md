## 🧤 Care Instructions
Sullivant's Astomum prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil and thrives in partial to indirect light conditions. Frequent watering is essential to maintain high humidity without waterlogging, and it requires minimal to no fertilizer due to its sensitivity to high nutrient levels.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses are sensitive to high nutrient concentrations. If grown in a controlled environment, an extremely dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer may be applied once or twice a year, or organic matter in the substrate suffices.
