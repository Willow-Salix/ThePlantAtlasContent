## Introduction
Chorizanthe is a genus of plants in the buckwheat family known generally as spineflowers. These are small, squat, herbaceous plants with spiny-looking inflorescences of flowers. The flowers may be in shades of red or yellow to white. The bracts are pointed and sometimes tipped with a hooked awn, and the inflorescence often dries into a rounded, spiny husk. Spineflowers are found in western North America and South America.
Name derivation: The word Chorizanthe comes from the Greek roots chorizo and anthos meaning "to divide," and "flower," thus meaning "divided flowers," but actually used in reference to the divided calyx.

## Care Guide
As a rare California native adapted to Mediterranean climates, the Contra Costa Spineflower requires full sun and excellent drainage. It is drought-tolerant and needs very little water once established, thriving in nutrient-poor soils with minimal fertilization. Protect it from excessive winter moisture.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. If absolutely necessary, a very light, balanced, slow-release native plant fertilizer can be applied once during the active growing season.
