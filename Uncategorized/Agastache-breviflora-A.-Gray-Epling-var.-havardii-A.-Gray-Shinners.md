## Introduction
Agastache () is a genus of aromatic flowering herbaceous perennial plants in the family Lamiaceae. It contains 22 species, mainly native to North America, one species native to eastern Asia. The common names of the species are a variety of fairly ambiguous and confusing "hyssops" and "mints"; as a whole the genus is known as giant hyssops or hummingbird mints.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils. Once established, it requires infrequent watering and very little to no fertilization. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, typically once in spring with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer, or none in naturally rich garden soil.
