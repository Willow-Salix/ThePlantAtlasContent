## Care Guide
Texas Millet thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, consistent with its native warm temperate grasslands. It prefers moderate watering but is drought-tolerant once established, requiring less frequent attention. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it readily adapts to average soil conditions.
