## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dwarf Euonymus is a hardy plant that thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native montane and continental climates. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and is generally not a heavy feeder. Ensure good drainage to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It naturally grows in average to poor, rocky soils. Heavy fertilization is generally not needed. A light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient if soil is poor or growth is desired.
