## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cyanea dunbarii requires a highly humid environment with consistent moisture and protection from direct sun, mimicking its native Hawaiian wet forest habitat. Ensure well-draining soil and water regularly, never allowing the soil to dry out completely. Feed sparingly with a dilute fertilizer during active growth.
