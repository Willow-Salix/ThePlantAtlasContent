## Introduction
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. Species are distributed widely – from Quebec to northern Argentina in the Americas, across northern and southern tropical Africa, in the southern Arabian Peninsula, in Myanmar and Thailand, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia.

## Care Guide
This tropical and subtropical native flourishes in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it needs minimal to moderate fertilization, primarily for other essential nutrients, especially during its growing season.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, reducing the need for nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied lightly during the growing season if soil is poor.
