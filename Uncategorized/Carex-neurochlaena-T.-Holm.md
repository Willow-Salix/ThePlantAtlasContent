| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Wetland/Marshland, characterized by cold winters and moist growing seasons. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; thrives in open, exposed sites within its native habitat. |

## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This sedge demands consistently wet or moist soil, ideally mimicking its native wetland conditions, and can tolerate full sun to partial shade. Provide moderate fertilization during the growing season if soil nutrients are lacking. It is well-suited for water gardens, bog gardens, or very damp areas in temperate to boreal climates.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typically found in environments with rich organic matter, but benefits from a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season, especially in nutrient-poor substrates.
