## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in arid to semi-arid regions, including Southwestern USA, Mexico, Mediterranean Basin, parts of Asia, and Africa. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure; this lichen is adapted to intense, direct sunlight typical of open desert environments. |
| **Watering** | Extremely infrequent watering. This species is highly desiccation-tolerant, relying on sparse rainfall or heavy dew for rehydration, allowing for long dry periods. |

## Introduction
Peltula is a genus of small dark brown to olive or dark grey squamulose lichens. These lichens typically grow on rocks in arid and semi-arid environments worldwide. They consist of a fungus living in symbiosis with a photosynthetic partner, specifically a cyanobacterium of the genus Chroococcidiopsis. Peltula is the only genus in the family Peltulaceae, which belongs to the Lichinomycetes, a class of fungi that form lichens. The genus includes about 50 recognised species, which have a variety of growth forms ranging from flat and crust-like to more complex, leaf-like structures. Peltula lichens play important ecological roles in harsh environments, contributing to soil stability and nutrient cycling.
To cope with their challenging habitats, Peltula species have evolved various adaptations. These include specialised protective layers and the ability to withstand both drought and flooding. The thalli of Peltula lichens are typically small, with a stratified structure consisting of an upper epinecral layer, a photobiont layer, a medulla, and usually a lower cortex. Peltulaceae generally lack secondary metabolites, which distinguishes them from many other lichen families. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, with members found across various continents, occupying diverse substrates including rocks, soil, and occasionally tree bark. Molecular phylogenetics studies have significantly altered the classification of these lichens. Formerly separate genera are now incorporated into Peltula, rendering Peltulaceae a monogeneric family.

## Care Guide
Peltula radicata is a desert lichen that thrives in full sun with extremely infrequent watering, mimicking its native arid conditions. No conventional fertilization is needed, as it gathers nutrients from the atmosphere and its substrate.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. As a lichen, it obtains necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and its substrate, and conventional fertilizers are unnecessary and potentially harmful.
