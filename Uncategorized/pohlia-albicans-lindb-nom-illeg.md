## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia, often found globally in suitable damp habitats. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal, characterized by consistently moist or wet environments such as stream banks, seeps, ditches, and damp soil. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to full sun, with a strong preference for consistent moisture levels. Tolerates more sun if the substrate remains constantly wet. |
| **💧 Water** | Needs constantly moist to wet conditions; never allow the substrate to dry out. Simulating natural damp, seeping environments is ideal. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pohlia is a genus of mosses in the family Mniaceae, found on all continents including Antarctica. Some of its species are native to multiple continents. The center of diversity is the Northern Hemisphere.
The genus name of Pohlia is in honour of Johann Ehrenfried Pohl (1746–1800), who was a German physician and botanist. 
The genus was circumscribed by Johann Hedwig in Descriptio et Adumbratio microscopio-analytica Muscorum
Frondosorum vol.1 on page 98 in 1785-1787.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in consistently wet to damp environments found in temperate and boreal regions. Provide partial shade to full sun, ensuring the substrate remains perpetually moist. Fertilization is generally not required due to its low nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; mosses are not heavy feeders. If grown in very inert substrate, a dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly every few months may be beneficial, but often not necessary.
