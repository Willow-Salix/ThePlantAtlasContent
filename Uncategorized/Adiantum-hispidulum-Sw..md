## Introduction
Adiantum (), the maidenhair fern (not to be confused with the similar-looking maidenhair spleenwort fern), is a genus of about 250 species of ferns in the subfamily Vittarioideae of the family Pteridaceae, though some researchers place it in its own family, Adiantaceae. The genus name comes from Greek, meaning "unwetted", referring to the fronds' ability to shed water without becoming wet.

## Care Guide
Provide bright, indirect light and maintain consistently moist soil, ensuring high humidity levels are met. Fertilize lightly during the warmer months, protecting it from direct sunlight and drafts. This fern thrives in a stable, humid environment mimicking its native subtropical rainforest habitat.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a diluted liquid fertilizer (half strength) during the growing season (spring and summer), as native forest soils are not overly rich.
