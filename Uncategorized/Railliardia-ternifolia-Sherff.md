## Introduction
Dubautia or na'ena'e is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. The genus was named after Joseph Eugène DuBaut (1796–1832), an officer in the French Navy who participated in Freycinet's expedition.
The entire genus is endemic to Hawaii. It contains more species than the other two genera in the silversword alliance, including cushion plants, shrubs, trees, and lianas.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in conditions mimicking its montane wet forest habitat. Provide bright, indirect light, maintain consistent moisture in well-draining soil, and offer light fertilization during periods of active growth to support its health.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Avoid over-fertilizing.
