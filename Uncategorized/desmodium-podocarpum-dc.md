## 🧤 Care Instructions
Desmodium podocarpum prefers partial to full sun and consistent moisture during its growing season, reflecting its native temperate to subtropical woodland environment. Being a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires low to moderate fertilization, avoiding excessive nitrogen. Overall, it's a relatively easy-care plant suited to garden edges or open areas.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen fertilizer is unnecessary. A balanced, general-purpose fertilizer or compost applied sparingly can be beneficial.
