## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Alpine regions across North America, Europe, and Asia (circumboreal distribution) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun; adapted to high light exposure due to lack of tree cover in its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings; tolerant of drought once established, reflecting periods of limited moisture in its native range. |

## Introduction
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## Care Guide
Glaucous bluegrass is a hardy plant that thrives in cool, exposed conditions with full to partial sun. It requires well-drained, nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils and is quite drought-tolerant once established, needing only moderate watering. This makes it a low-maintenance choice for challenging, exposed locations.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-drained soils typical of alpine and arctic environments.
