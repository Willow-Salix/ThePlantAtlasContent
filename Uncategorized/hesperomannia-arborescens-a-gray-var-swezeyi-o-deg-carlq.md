## 🧤 Care Instructions
This rare Hawaiian plant requires consistent moisture, high humidity, and well-drained soil to mimic its native tropical montane wet forest habitat. Provide bright, indirect light or partial shade, and fertilize sparingly with a balanced, diluted solution during active growth to support its delicate nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season, or a slow-release option applied sparingly.
