## Introduction
Tium (Greek: Τῖον) was an ancient settlement, also known as Filyos (Greek: Φίλειος), on the south coast of the Black Sea at the mouth of the river Billaeus in present-day Turkey. Ancient writers variously assigned it to ancient Paphlagonia or Bithynia.
Apart from Tium, Latinized forms of the name are Teium, Tieium and Tius, corresponding to the Greek names Τεῖον (Teion), Τιεῖον (Tieion), Τῖον (Tion) and Τῖος (Tios).

## Care Guide
Michaux's Milkvetch thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions characteristic of its native dry pine flatwoods and sandhills. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, preferring lean, sandy soils with little to no supplemental fertilizer. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is needed. It thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils and, as a legume, fixes its own nitrogen.
