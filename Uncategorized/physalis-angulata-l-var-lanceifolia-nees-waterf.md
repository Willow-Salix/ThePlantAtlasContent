## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas (e.g., Central and South America). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical zones, often found in disturbed areas, forest edges, and open fields. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflecting its preference for open, exposed environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist soil, especially during flowering and fruiting. Water regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings, but avoid waterlogging, consistent with rainfall patterns in its native climate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Physalis (, , , , from Ancient Greek: φυσαλλίς phusallís 'bladder') is a genus of approximately 75 to 90 flowering plants in the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which are native to the Americas and Australasia. At least 46 species are endemic to Mexico. Cultivated and weedy species have been introduced worldwide. A defining feature of Physalis is a large, papery husk derived from the calyx, which partly or fully encloses the fruit. Many species bear edible fruit, and some species are cultivated.
The typical Physalis fruit is similar to a firm tomato in texture, and like a sweet, tangy grape in flavor. Some species, such as the Cape gooseberry and tomatillo, have been bred into many cultivars with varying flavors, from tart to sweet to savory. Nations including Colombia, India, and Mexico have a significant economic trade in Physalis fruit. The fruits of many species are generically referred to as physalis, groundcherries, husk tomatoes, husk cherries, poha berries, and golden berries.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fast-growing annual thrives in warm, tropical, and subtropical conditions. Provide full sun to partial shade and consistently moist soil for optimal growth and fruit production. Fertilize moderately during the growing season to support its vigorous nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season. Its weedy nature suggests it can adapt to moderate soil fertility but will benefit from nutrients for optimal fruit production.
