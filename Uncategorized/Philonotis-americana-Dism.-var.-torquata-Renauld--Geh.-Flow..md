## Care Guide
This moss requires a consistently moist, high-humidity environment with low to partial sun exposure, mimicking its native temperate wetland habitats. It has very low nutrient needs and should never be allowed to dry out.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Mosses have very low nutrient requirements; if any fertilization is considered, use an extremely diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly.
