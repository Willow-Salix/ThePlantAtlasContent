## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western and Central North America, including regions like the Rocky Mountains, parts of the Pacific Northwest, and Great Plains (e.g., Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Idaho, Utah). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine, Moist Meadows, Riparian Zones. Characterized by distinct seasons, cold winters, mild to moderate summers, and consistent moisture from rainfall or snowmelt. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full sun, preferring partial shade in hot afternoon sun or warmer climates to prevent scorching and maintain soil moisture. It thrives in open, bright conditions in its native, often high-elevation habitats. |
| **Watering** | High. Keep soil consistently moist; this plant does not tolerate drought. Water regularly, especially during dry periods, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, as it's found near streambanks and moist meadows. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native streambank and meadow habitats. Provide partial to full sun exposure, ensuring protection from intense afternoon sun in warmer regions. Maintain moderate soil fertility for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or enriching the soil with organic compost, can support vigorous growth.
