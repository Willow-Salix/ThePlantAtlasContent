## Introduction
Edgeworthia (paper bush) is a genus of plants in the family Thymelaeaceae. When the genus was first described, it was published twice in the same year (1841), in two separate publications: Plantarum vascularium genera: secundum ordines naturales digesta eorumque differentiae et affinitates tabulis diagnostacis expositae; and Denkschriften der Regensburgischen Botanischen Gesellschaft. The genus was named in honour of Michael Pakenham Edgeworth, an Irish botanist and official in the Bengal Civil Service, then stationed in India, and for his half-sister, writer Maria Edgeworth.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Oriental Paperbush requires a site with partial shade to partial sun, receiving protection from intense afternoon heat. Maintain consistent soil moisture, ensuring good drainage to prevent waterlogging. A light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring will support robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Lightly fertilize in early spring with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or organic compost to support its growth in moderately fertile forest soils.
