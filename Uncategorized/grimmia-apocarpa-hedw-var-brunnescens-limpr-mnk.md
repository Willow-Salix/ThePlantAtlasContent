## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Holarctic regions (Northern Hemisphere), including North America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal/Alpine zones, often found on exposed rocks in forests, mountains, or open areas. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial Sun to Partial Shade. Can tolerate some direct morning sun but prefers protection from intense afternoon sun, which can cause desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged. Tolerates occasional drying out between waterings due to its desiccation-tolerant nature. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Grimmia Moss thrives in cool to temperate environments with consistent moisture, though it can withstand short dry periods. It prefers partial sun to partial shade and requires very little, if any, supplemental fertilization. Ensure good drainage and avoid waterlogging to prevent rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses derive most nutrients from their environment (rainwater, dust, decaying matter). No regular fertilization is typically needed; if applied, use a highly diluted solution sparingly.
