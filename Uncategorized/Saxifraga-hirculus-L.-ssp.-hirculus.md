## Care Guide
This plant thrives in perpetually wet, even waterlogged, soil conditions, ideally mimicking its native bog or fen habitat. It prefers full sun to partial shade during its short growing season. Fertilization should be light, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization, if any, is usually sufficient. It is adapted to nutrient-poor boggy soils; excessive fertilizer can be detrimental.
