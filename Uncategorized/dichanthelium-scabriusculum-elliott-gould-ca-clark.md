## 🧤 Care Instructions
Woolly Rosette Grass requires consistently moist to wet soil, reflecting its native humid subtropical wetland habitats. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and benefits from warm, humid conditions. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to naturally less rich soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a native grass, it is adapted to less rich soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring should be sufficient, or none if soil is already fertile.
