## Care Guide
Pennsylvania Sedge thrives in partial to full shade with moderate, consistent moisture, reflecting its woodland origins. It is relatively low-maintenance regarding nutrients, benefiting from organic matter. Ensure well-drained soil to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from an annual top-dressing of compost or a light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, particularly in poorer soils.
