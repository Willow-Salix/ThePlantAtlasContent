## 🧤 Care Instructions
Vallesia thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical and subtropical dry forests and coastal scrublands. Provide full sun to partial shade and allow the soil to dry out between waterings, reducing frequency during dormancy. Fertilize lightly during the active growing season.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer). Native soils in these biomes are not typically exceptionally rich.
