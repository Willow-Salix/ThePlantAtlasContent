## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Arizona, Nevada) and northern Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Rocky Slopes (Mediterranean and Desert-adjacent Climates) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. In cultivation, bright direct morning sun or bright indirect light is ideal, mimicking its rocky, often exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant. Allow the growing medium to dry out completely between waterings. Infrequent watering is key, especially during cooler or dormant periods, as it is adapted to dry summers. |

## Introduction
Cheilanthes, commonly known as lip ferns, is a genus of about 180 species of rock-dwelling ferns with a cosmopolitan distribution in warm, dry, rocky regions, often growing in small crevices high up on cliffs.  Most are small, sturdy and evergreen.   The leaves, often densely covered in trichomes, spring directly from the rootstocks.  Many of them are desert ferns, curling up during dry times and reviving with the coming of moisture.  At the ends of veins sporangia, or spore-bearing structures, are protected by leaf margins, which curl over them.

## Care Guide
Lemmon's Lip Fern thrives in conditions mirroring its arid, rocky native habitats. Provide bright direct morning sun or bright indirect light and allow the growing medium to dry completely between infrequent waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be minimal or unnecessary, as it is adapted to poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Its native rocky habitats are typically nutrient-poor. If fertilizing, use a very diluted, balanced fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season.
