## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Primarily Central and South America, particularly the Andes (Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia), extending to Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Montane Forests, Cloud Forests, and disturbed areas within these biomes. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to bright indirect light, often growing as an understory plant or at forest edges. Avoid intense, direct afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained, reflecting the humid conditions of its native habitat. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly before rewatering. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
To mimic its native montane forest environment, Jaltomata requires consistent moisture, well-drained soil, and bright, indirect light. Moderate fertilization during the growing season will support its health. Ensure protection from harsh direct sun and waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
