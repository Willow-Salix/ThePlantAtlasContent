## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including the Rocky Mountains, Cascade Range, and Sierra Nevada (e.g., US states like Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, and parts of British Columbia, Canada). |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Meadows, Montane Grasslands, Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in exposed high-altitude meadows with little canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Moderate, consistent moisture, especially during the growing season, in well-drained soil; it benefits from steady moisture from snowmelt and summer rains but can tolerate brief dry periods. |

## Care Guide
This high-altitude grass thrives in cool, exposed conditions, requiring full sun and consistent moisture in well-drained soil. It is adapted to lean nutrient environments, thus requiring minimal to no fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal; adapted to lean, nutrient-poor mountain soils. Excessive fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
