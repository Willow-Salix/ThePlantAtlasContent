## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in temperate and boreal regions of Europe (e.g., British Isles, Fennoscandia) and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Montane/Upland (on exposed acidic rocks) |
| **☀️ Light** | High direct sun exposure; thrives in well-lit, open environments typical of exposed rock faces. |
| **💧 Water** | Absorbs moisture directly from rain, dew, and atmospheric humidity. Requires periods of thorough wetting followed by complete drying; does not tolerate constant dampness. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a saxicolous lichen, Lecidea dilutiuscula thrives on exposed acidic rocks in temperate to boreal montane regions. It requires high sun exposure and cycles of wetting and drying from natural precipitation, with no need for soil or artificial fertilizers. Care involves mimicking its natural outdoor rocky habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain nutrients from atmospheric deposition and the substrate; artificial fertilizers can be harmful.
