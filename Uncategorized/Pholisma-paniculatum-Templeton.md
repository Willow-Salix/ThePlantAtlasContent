## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily California) and Northwestern Mexico (Baja California) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, mirroring its open desert and coastal dune habitats. |
| **Watering** | Extremely low water needs; highly drought-tolerant. Water infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking sporadic desert rainfall. |

## Introduction
The genus Pholisma (Nutt. ex Hook.) consists of three species of desert-dwelling, primarily subterranean plants. Pholisma belongs to the family Boraginaceae.
Most notable of the genus is Pholisma sonorae, native to the southwestern United States and Mexico. The species is without chlorophyll and lives as a parasite on the roots of a number of desert species. Other species include Pholisma arenarium, the "desert Christmas tree", and Pholisma culiacana.

## Care Guide
This highly specialized parasitic plant requires a specific host for survival, making cultivation extremely challenging. It thrives in full sun and very dry conditions, demanding minimal watering. Direct fertilization is not typically needed as it acquires nutrients from its host.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none for the plant itself, as it is a parasitic plant that obtains nutrients from its host (e.g., buckwheat species). Its native sandy soils are typically nutrient-poor.
