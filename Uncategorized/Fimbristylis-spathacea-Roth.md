## Introduction
Fimbristylis is a genus of sedges. A plant in this genus may be known commonly as a fimbry or   fimbristyle. There are over 300 species distributed worldwide. Several continents have native species but many species have been introduced to regions where they are not native. Some are considered weeds. These are typical sedges in appearance, with stiff, ridged stems and cone-shaped terminal panicles of spikelets. They are found in wet environments, and are most diverse in tropical and subtropical regions.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in bright, open environments with abundant moisture, mimicking its native coastal wetland habitat. Ensure consistent soil wetness, even allowing for standing water, and provide full to partial sun. While adaptable to poor soils, a light monthly feeding will support robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a light, balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season, or can tolerate nutrient-poor soils.
