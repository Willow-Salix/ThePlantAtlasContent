## 🌱 Overview
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native alpine environment. Provide full sun exposure and ensure excellent drainage with minimal watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. Avoid rich soils and heavy fertilization as these can harm the plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; prefers nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
