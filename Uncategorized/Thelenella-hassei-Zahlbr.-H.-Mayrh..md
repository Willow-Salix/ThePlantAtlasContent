## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily California, Arizona, New Mexico) and Baja California, Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (warm, dry summers; mild, wet winters) and Arid/Semi-arid regions, often on calcareous rocks. |
| **Sunlight** | Tolerates full sun but can also be found in partial shade, especially in hotter, drier regions. Prefers bright, indirect light or morning sun when cultivated to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | As a lichen, it absorbs moisture from atmospheric humidity, dew, and rainfall. It is highly tolerant of desiccation, adapting to dry summers. In cultivation, provide intermittent moisture through misting or high humidity, allowing for complete drying out between moisture events to mimic natural rain/dew cycles. |

## Introduction
Thelenella is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Thelenellaceae. These inconspicuous lichens form thin, crust-like growths that are tightly attached to their substrates and appear as dull whitish, pale grey, or light brown patches. Species of Thelenella are commonly found in damp, shaded environments where they grow on tree bark, living leaves, moss cushions, rock faces, and moss-rich soil. The genus is distinguished by its thick-walled fruiting bodies that are mostly embedded within the lichen crust and contain multicellular spores with multiple cross-walls.

## Care Guide
Hasse's Thelenella Lichen is a rock-dwelling species thriving in bright light, capable of tolerating full sun to partial shade. It requires periods of moisture from humidity or misting, interspersed with complete drying, and does not need any supplemental fertilization. Its care should simulate its native Mediterranean and arid environments.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens obtain nutrients from the environment (air, rain, substrate) and do not benefit from traditional fertilizers, which can be detrimental.
