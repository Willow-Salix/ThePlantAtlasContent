## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Florida (USA), Cuba, Bahamas |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Forest (epiphytic) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun; avoid harsh midday sun which can scorch leaves. Mimics light conditions under a canopy. |
| **Watering** | Water thoroughly when the growing medium is dry to the touch, allowing it to dry out completely between waterings. Increase frequency during warmer growing seasons and reduce during cooler, less active periods, reflecting native wet and dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Encyclia is also a Greek term for the Codex Encyclius

Encyclia is a genus of orchids. The genus name comes from Greek enkykleomai ("to encircle"), referring to the lateral lobes of the lip which encircle the column. It is abbreviated as E. in the horticultural trade.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires a wet-dry cycle reminiscent of its native subtropical habitat. Water thoroughly when dry during active growth and reduce in cooler months, ensuring good air circulation around the roots. Feed lightly with an orchid-specific fertilizer during its growing season to support robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize with a balanced orchid-specific fertilizer at half-strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Reduce or stop fertilizing during dormancy.
