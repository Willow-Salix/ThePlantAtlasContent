## Care Guide
This arctic and alpine plant requires full sun and exceptionally well-drained, lean soil. During its short growing season, provide consistent moisture, ensuring roots never sit in standing water. Fertilization should be minimal or avoided entirely to mimic its native, nutrient-poor environment.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. If necessary, apply a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once during the growing season, as native soils are typically nutrient-poor.
