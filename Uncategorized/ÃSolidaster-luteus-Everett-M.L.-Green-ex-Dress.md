*Ã—Solidaster luteus (Everett) M.L. Green ex Dress* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (derived from parent species *Solidago* and *Symphyotrichum*) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie and Forest Edge |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun is ideal. These plants thrive in environments with ample direct sunlight, typical of open fields and clearings. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is needed. Allow the top soil to dry slightly between waterings, mimicking the typical rainfall patterns and dry spells of temperate regions. |

## Care Guide
Solidaster thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its origins in open, temperate North American landscapes. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and fertilize sparingly to promote healthy growth without encouraging legginess.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly, especially in nutrient-poor soils, as these plants are adapted to moderately fertile natural environments.
