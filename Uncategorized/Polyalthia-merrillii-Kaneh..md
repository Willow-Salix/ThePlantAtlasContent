## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Philippines |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial shade to dappled sun; avoid harsh direct afternoon sun which can scorch leaves, mimicking its understory position. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, reflecting high tropical rainfall and humidity. |

## Introduction
Polyalthia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Annonaceae. There are approximately 90 species distributed from Africa to Asia and the Pacific.
These are trees and shrubs. The flower has six petals in two whorls, the inner petals curving inward over the centre.
The name Polyalthia is derived from a combination of Greek words meaning 'many cures' with reference to the medicinal properties of certain species.

## Care Guide
Merrill's Polyalthia thrives when provided with conditions similar to its native Philippine rainforest, emphasizing high humidity and consistent moisture. Ensure it receives dappled or partial shade, never full direct sun, and a regular feeding schedule during its active growth period for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, slow-release or liquid fertilizer applied moderately during the growing season (spring through summer), to support lush growth in nutrient-rich yet fast-draining tropical soils.
