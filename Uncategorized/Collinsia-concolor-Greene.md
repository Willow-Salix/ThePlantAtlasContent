## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Chaparral and Coastal Sage Scrub biome) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers ample direct sunlight in its native open and semi-open habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent watering during its active growing season (spring), allowing the soil surface to dry slightly between waterings. As an annual, it will naturally decline and require no water after flowering and seed set, adapting to the dry summer conditions of its native climate. |

## Introduction
Collinsia is a genus of about 20 species of annual flowering plants, consisting of the blue eyed Marys and the Chinese houses.  It was traditionally placed in the snapdragon family Scrophulariaceae, but following recent research in molecular genetics, it has now been placed in a much enlarged family Plantaginaceae.
The genus is endemic to North America, and is named in honor of Zacchaeus Collins, a Philadelphia botanist of the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century. Many of the 20 species may be found in California.
Two species, Collinsia parviflora (smallflower blue eyed Mary) and Collinsia violacea (violet blue eyed Mary), had medicinal uses among American Indian peoples.

## Care Guide
Collinsia concolor thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean chaparral habitat. Provide consistent moisture during its spring growing season, reducing watering significantly once flowering ceases and the plant naturally senesces. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, as it is adapted to less fertile conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It thrives in naturally less rich soils of chaparral and scrublands, so a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer at the start of the growing season is sufficient, or none if soil is moderately fertile.
