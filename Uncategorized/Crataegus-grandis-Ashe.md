## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thriving in the humid subtropical climate of the southeastern US, Grand Hawthorn prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. While somewhat drought-tolerant once established, regular watering during dry spells and minimal fertilization will support its growth. This adaptable plant is relatively low-maintenance.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial, especially in poor soils, but it's often not essential in fertile garden soil.
