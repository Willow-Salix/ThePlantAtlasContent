| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (North Carolina to Florida, west to Texas) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (specifically coastal plains, pine flatwoods, sandy savannas, and open woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) reflecting its native open habitat. |

## Introduction
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## Care Guide
Pinkscale Blazing Star is a low-maintenance plant ideal for full sun exposure. It requires well-drained soil and, once established, is quite drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping or areas with sandy soils. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile, well-drained soils, consistent with its native sandy, often infertile habitats.
