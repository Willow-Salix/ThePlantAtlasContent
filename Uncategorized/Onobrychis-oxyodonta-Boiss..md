## Introduction
Onobrychis, the sainfoins, are a genus of Eurasian perennial herbaceous plants of the legume family (Fabaceae). About 206 species are presently accepted. The Flora Europaea lists 23 species of Onobrychis; the main centre of diversity extends from Central Asia to Iran, with 56 species – 27 of which are endemic – in the latter country alone. O. viciifolia is naturalized throughout many countries in Europe and North America grasslands on calcareous soils.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils typical of its native semi-arid steppe and montane environments. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and generally requires minimal watering and fertilization due to its adaptation to harsh conditions and nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. If grown in very poor soil, a balanced, low-dose fertilizer once in spring might be beneficial, but generally not required.
