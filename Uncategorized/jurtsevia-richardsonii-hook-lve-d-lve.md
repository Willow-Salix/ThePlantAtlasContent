## 🌱 Overview
Anemonastrum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Plants of the genus are native to the temperate and subarctic regions of North America, Greenland, Europe, Asia, South America, and New Zealand. The generic name Anemonastrum means "somewhat like anemone", a reference to the Anemone genus of closely related plants. It chiefly differs from Anemone in having a base chromosome number of x=7, as opposed to x=8.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy subarctic plant requires full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its native tundra and alpine environments. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly due to its adaptation to lean, nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, often rocky or sandy soils. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, with a diluted, balanced formula only if growth appears weak.
