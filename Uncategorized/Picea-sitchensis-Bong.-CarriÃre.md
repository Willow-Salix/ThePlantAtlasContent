## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal regions of western North America, from southern Alaska through British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, to northern California. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rainforest / Coastal Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for optimal growth, especially once established, but can tolerate some shade when young. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and thrives in high humidity with frequent rainfall. Ensure soil does not dry out completely, but avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Picea sitchensis, the Sitka spruce, is a large, coniferous, evergreen tree growing to just over 100 meters (330 ft) tall, with a trunk diameter at breast height that can exceed 5 m (16 ft). It is by far the largest species of spruce and the fifth-largest conifer in the world (behind giant sequoia, coast redwood, kauri, and western redcedar), and the third-tallest tree species (after coast redwood and South Tibetan cypress). The Sitka spruce is one of only three species documented to exceed 100 m (330 ft) in height.  Its name is derived from the community of Sitka in southeast Alaska, where it is prevalent. Its range hugs the western coast of Canada and the US and continues south into northern California.

## Care Guide
The Sitka Spruce thrives in cool, humid coastal environments with consistently moist, well-drained soil and ample light. Ensure regular watering, especially when young, keeping the soil moist but never waterlogged, and protect from prolonged dry periods. Established trees require minimal intervention once their environmental needs are met.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Established trees in suitable native-like conditions require minimal fertilization. Young or container-grown plants may benefit from a balanced, slow-release, acid-loving tree fertilizer applied sparingly in spring.
