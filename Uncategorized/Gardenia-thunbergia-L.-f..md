## Introduction
Gardenia is a genus of flowering plants in the coffee family, Rubiaceae, native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, Madagascar, Pacific Islands, and Australia.
The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus and John Ellis after Alexander Garden (1730–1791), a Scottish naturalist. The type species is Gardenia jasminoides, as first published by Ellis in 1761.

## Care Guide
This gardenia thrives in conditions mimicking its native subtropical and warm temperate forest habitat. Provide partial shade to dappled sun and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, avoiding extreme dryness or waterlogging. Feed regularly during the growing season with an acid-loving fertilizer to encourage healthy growth and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Regular feeding with an acid-loving fertilizer during the growing season (spring to late summer); prefers rich, organic soil.
