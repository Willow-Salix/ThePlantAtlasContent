| **Sunlight** | High light to full sun exposure, mimicking its natural habitat above the tree line where it receives unobstructed sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires periodic wetting from rain or mist, followed by complete drying. It does not tolerate prolonged wetness or standing water, but needs regular atmospheric moisture for hydration. |

## Care Guide
This alpine lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions with excellent air circulation. It needs periodic wetting and drying cycles, similar to natural rainfall patterns, and no supplemental fertilization. Avoid prolonged dampness and high nutrient environments.

### Fertilizer
No external fertilization is required; lichens obtain sufficient nutrients from atmospheric dust and rainfall. High nutrient concentrations can be detrimental.
