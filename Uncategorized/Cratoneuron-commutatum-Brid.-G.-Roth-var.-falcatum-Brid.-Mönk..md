## Care Guide
This moss thrives in persistently cold, wet, and calcareous environments, mimicking its natural spring-fed habitat. It demands continuous saturation and can tolerate bright light conditions as long as temperatures remain cool and moisture is abundant. Supplemental fertilization is generally unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers calcium-rich water but does not typically require additional fertilization; excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
