## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Eastern North America, and parts of Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Deciduous Forests, particularly old-growth woodlands characterized by consistent rainfall and high atmospheric humidity. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate indirect light. Thrives in the deep shade and filtered light found under a dense forest canopy, avoiding direct sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently high atmospheric humidity. As an epiphytic lichen, it absorbs moisture from the air and dew/rain, so frequent misting is crucial. Does not tolerate prolonged dryness or standing water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bactrospora is a genus of lichen-forming fungi of uncertain familial placement in the order Arthoniales. These lichens grow as thin crusts on tree bark in shaded, humid environments and are distinguished by their unusually long, needle-like spores that often break apart into smaller pieces. Species in the genus are found worldwide, particularly in tropical and temperate forests where they help form part of the diverse bark-dwelling lichen community.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen demands high atmospheric humidity and low to moderate indirect light, mirroring its native old-growth forest habitat. Ensure consistent moisture through regular misting, while strictly avoiding any fertilizers due to its extreme sensitivity.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer is needed. Lichens are extremely sensitive to external nutrients and pollutants, deriving what they need from the air and their substrate.
