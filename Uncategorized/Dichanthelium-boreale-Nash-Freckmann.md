## Care Guide
Northern Panicgrass is a hardy temperate grass that thrives in full sun to partial shade and adaptable to various soil moistures, from dry to moist. Provide moderate watering and low to moderate fertilization. This adaptable nature makes it relatively low-maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
