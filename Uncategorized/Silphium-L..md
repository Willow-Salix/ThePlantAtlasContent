## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern North America (e.g., prairies, open woodlands of the central and eastern United States and parts of Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland (Prairies and Open Woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and abundant flowering, reflecting their open prairie habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established due to deep taproots, but benefits from moderate, consistent watering during prolonged dry periods, especially during active growth and flowering. |

## Introduction
Silphium is a genus of North American plants in the tribe Heliantheae within the family Asteraceae.
Members of the genus, commonly known as rosinweeds, are herbaceous perennial plants growing to 0.2 m (8 in) to more than 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) tall, with yellow (rarely white) flowerheads that resemble sunflowers. In the rosinweeds, the ray florets in the head are female and the disc florets are male; this differs from sunflowers, where ray florets are sterile and disc florets are perfect, capable of producing both pollen and seeds.
The name of the genus comes from the Ancient Greek word for a North African plant whose identity has been lost, though it is known its gum or juice was prized by the ancients as a medicine and a condiment.

## Care Guide
Rosinweed thrives in full sun and well-drained, fertile soil, characteristic of its native prairie habitat. While very drought-tolerant once established, it benefits from moderate watering during extended dry spells to support vigorous growth. Minimal fertilization is usually sufficient, as it is adapted to naturally rich soils.

### Fertilizer
Generally low to moderate. Prefers naturally fertile, well-draining soils. May benefit from a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in poor soils, but typically requires little additional feeding.
