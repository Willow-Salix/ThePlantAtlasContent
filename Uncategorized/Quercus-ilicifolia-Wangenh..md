## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern United States (e.g., Maine, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia) and southeastern Canada, primarily in sandy, rocky, or acidic barrens and dry uplands. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest (specifically adapted to dry, nutrient-poor, often fire-prone sites within this biome). |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in exposed locations. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent to moderate watering. Highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring excellent drainage; dislikes consistently wet soil. |

## Introduction
Quercus ilicifolia, commonly known as bear oak or scrub oak, is a small shrubby oak native to the Eastern United States and, less commonly, in southeastern Canada. Its range in the United States extends from Maine to North Carolina, with reports of a few populations north of the international frontier in Ontario. The name ilicifolia means "holly-leaved".

## Care Guide
The Bear Oak thrives in full sun and very well-drained, acidic, nutrient-poor soils, making it exceptionally drought-tolerant once established. It requires minimal watering and fertilization, reflecting its natural habitat on dry barrens and rocky slopes. This species is ideal for challenging garden spots where other plants might struggle.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Naturally grows in poor, acidic soils; excessive fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
