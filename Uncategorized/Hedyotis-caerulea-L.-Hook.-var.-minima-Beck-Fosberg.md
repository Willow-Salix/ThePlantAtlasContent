## Care Guide
This plant thrives in temperate conditions, preferring consistently moist, well-drained soil and adaptable to partial to full sun exposure. Ensure regular watering to prevent the soil from drying out and provide light fertilization in spring to support its delicate bloom.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in early spring, or enriching the soil with organic compost, is generally sufficient for healthy growth. Avoid excessive feeding.
