## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Alpine and arctic regions of Europe (e.g., Alps, Pyrenees, Scandinavia) and North America (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Arctic Canada) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra (saxicolous) |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure, mimicking exposed rock faces in its native alpine and arctic environments, often full sun with strong UV radiation. |
| **Watering** | Relies on atmospheric moisture (rain, snowmelt, fog). Requires intermittent hydration followed by complete drying, mimicking natural cycles of wet and dry periods. |

## Introduction
Tremolecia is a small genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Hymeneliaceae.

## Care Guide
As a saxicolous lichen from alpine and arctic regions, Tremolecia micropsis requires high exposure to natural light and intermittent atmospheric moisture. It thrives on exposed rock and is highly sensitive to any form of traditional fertilizer or environmental pollutants.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens obtain trace nutrients from atmospheric deposition and are highly sensitive to artificial fertilizers and pollutants.
