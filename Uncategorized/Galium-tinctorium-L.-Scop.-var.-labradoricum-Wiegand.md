## Introduction
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## Care Guide
This wetland native thrives in consistently wet to very moist soil, preferring partial to full sun exposure. It requires low to moderate fertility, adapting well to the often nutrient-limited environments of bogs and fens. Ensure soil never dries out.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; adapted to nutrient-poor to moderately fertile wetland soils.
