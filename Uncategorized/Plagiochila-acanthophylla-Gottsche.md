## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America (e.g., Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Rainforest / Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch its delicate tissues. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged; high atmospheric humidity is crucial. Daily misting or placement in a terrarium/humid environment is recommended. |

## Introduction
Plagiochila is a large, common, and widespread genus of liverworts in the order Jungermanniales. It is a member of the family  Plagiochilaceae within that order. There may be anywhere from 500 to 1300 species, most of them from the tropics; the exact number is still under revision.

## Care Guide
This tropical liverwort requires conditions mimicking its native cloud forest habitat: very high humidity, consistently moist substrate, and low, indirect light. It is ideally suited for terrariums or humid vivariums where stable moisture and atmospheric conditions can be maintained.

### Fertilizer
Minimal. If applied, use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/8 to 1/4 strength) very sparingly during active growth periods, as it relies on atmospheric and substrate decay for nutrients.
