## Introduction
Cyclosorus is a genus of ferns in the family Thelypteridaceae, subfamily Thelypteridoideae, in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Other sources sink Cyclosorus into a very broadly defined genus Thelypteris, or expand the genus to include other genera which PPG I keeps separate. Thus the online Flora of China suggests there are about 250 species compared to the two species suggested in PPG I.
There are also fossil species known from the Eocene of South China and the Quaternary of Australia.
The genus is named from the Greek, referring to the circular sori.

## Care Guide
The Pohnpei Fern thrives in conditions that mimic its native tropical rainforest understory. Provide consistent moisture to the soil, maintain high humidity, and ensure it receives only indirect, low to medium light. Fertilize lightly during the active growing period.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer).
