### *Lecanora valesiaca (MÃ¼ll. Arg.) Stizenb.*

![Rim Lichen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Lecanora_muralis-2.jpg)

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mountainous regions across temperate and cold zones, including the Alps and Pyrenees in Europe, and the Rocky Mountains in North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Montane |
| **☀️ Light** | High light exposure, mimicking its natural habitat on exposed rock surfaces in mountainous regions. Can tolerate direct sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, thorough misting or wetting, allowing for complete drying cycles between exposures. Mimics snowmelt and occasional rain in alpine environments; sensitive to prolonged dampness. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for this rim lichen, mimic its native alpine environment by providing high light exposure and allowing for distinct wet and dry cycles. Avoid any supplemental fertilization, as lichens are highly sensitive to nutrient overloads and chemical inputs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens are extremely efficient at obtaining trace nutrients from the air and substrate and are sensitive to added chemicals or nutrient overloads.
