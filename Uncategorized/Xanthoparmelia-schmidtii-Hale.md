## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert Biomes, particularly high desert and rocky outcrops. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, often in open, unshaded areas on rock surfaces. It thrives in high light intensity. |
| **Watering** | Minimal and infrequent. This lichen is highly drought-tolerant, absorbing moisture from occasional rain, dew, or fog, followed by long dry periods. Avoid constant dampness. |

## Introduction
Xanthoparmelia (commonly known as green rock shields or rock-shield lichens) is a genus of foliose lichens in the family Parmeliaceae. This genus of lichen is commonly found in the United States, South America, southern Africa, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
The name means 'golden yellow parmelia'. The photobiont (photosynthetic partner) is Trebouxia (a genus of green algae).

## Care Guide
This lichen requires bright, direct sunlight and very infrequent moisture, mimicking its native arid habitat. It does not need fertilization and thrives on exposure to dry air and sporadic wetting events.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens obtain essential nutrients from the atmosphere (dust, precipitation) and their substrate; supplemental fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental.
