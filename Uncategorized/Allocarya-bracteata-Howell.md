# Bracted Allocarya

*Allocarya bracteata Howell* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (primarily California and southwestern Oregon) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Vernal Pool Habitat |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as its native habitat is open and exposed. |
| **Watering** | Extremely specific. Requires abundant water, often standing water, during its active growth phase (winter/spring). Must experience a prolonged, completely dry period during summer dormancy to mimic its native vernal pool cycle. |

## Care Guide
This plant requires a distinct wet-dry cycle, needing saturated soil or standing water during its growth period (winter/spring) and then complete dryness for dormancy in summer. Provide full sun exposure and avoid heavy fertilization, as it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native vernal pool soils are typically low in nutrients, and the plant is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.
