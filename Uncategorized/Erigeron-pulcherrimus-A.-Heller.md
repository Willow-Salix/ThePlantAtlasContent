## Care Guide
Basin fleabane thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soils, mirroring its native arid scrubland conditions. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, with minimal to no fertilization needed.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements, as it is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils typical of its native desert and rangeland environments.
