## Introduction
Hesperomannia (island-aster) is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.
Hesperomannia is endemic to Hawaii and consists of four species:

Hesperomannia arborescens A.Gray – Lanai hesperomannia
Hesperomannia arbuscula Hillebr. – Maui hesperomannia
Hesperomannia lydgatei C.N.Forbes – Kauai hesperomannia
Hesperomannia oahuensis (Hillebr.) O.Deg.
Hesperomannia swezeyi O.Deg.
Although traditionally classified in the tribe Mutisieae, molecular evidence shows that it belongs in the tribe Vernonieae, most closely related to the African Vernonia species.

## Care Guide
This critically endangered Hawaiian endemic thrives in conditions replicating its native tropical mesic to wet forests. Provide indirect bright light, ensure consistently moist but well-draining soil, and maintain high humidity. Feed lightly during warmer months to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
