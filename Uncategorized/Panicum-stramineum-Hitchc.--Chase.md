## Care Guide
Panicum stramineum thrives in bright, full sun conditions, typical of its native arid grasslands. It requires minimal water, tolerating drought well, and prefers well-draining, sandy soils without the need for frequent fertilization. This resilient grass is best suited for dry, open environments.
