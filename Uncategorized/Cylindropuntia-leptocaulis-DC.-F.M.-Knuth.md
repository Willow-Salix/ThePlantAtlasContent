## Introduction
Cylindropuntia is a genus of cacti (family Cactaceae), containing species commonly known as chollas ( CHOY-əz), native to northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States. They are known for their barbed spines that tenaciously attach to skin, fur, and clothing.
Stands of cholla are called cholla gardens. Individuals within these colonies often exhibit the same DNA, as they were formerly tubercles of an original plant.

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, mimicking its arid native environment. Ensure excellent drainage and provide minimal fertilizer to prevent over-enrichment, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings.

### Fertilizer
Low; apply a balanced, diluted cactus fertilizer sparingly (once or twice during the active growing season) or not at all if repotting regularly.
