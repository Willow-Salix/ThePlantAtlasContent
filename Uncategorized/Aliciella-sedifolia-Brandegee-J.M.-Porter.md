## Introduction
Aliciella is a genus of plants in the phlox family. It includes 23 species native to the western United States and northwestern Mexico. These plants have been treated as members of genus Gilia until recently, when it was proposed they be moved back to Aliciella. This genus was created in 1905 to include certain gilias that seemed distinct from most of the others, but it was abandoned soon after. Later genetic analyses suggest it should be revived.

## Care Guide
Stonecrop Gilia thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soils, adapted to arid desert conditions. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between applications, and has minimal fertilizer needs. Overwatering is its primary enemy.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required; use a very dilute, low-nitrogen formula if needed, once per growing season.
