## Care Guide
Capeweed, native to the Mediterranean climate of South Africa, thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established. It requires moderate watering during active growth but should be allowed to dry out between waterings. This plant is not a heavy feeder and can prosper in average soils with minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in average to poor soils without heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer application once a year during active growth is usually sufficient.
