## Care Guide
This groundplum milkvetch thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, mimicking its native arid grasslands. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and has minimal fertilizer needs due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required; as a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. If soil is extremely poor, a very light application of a low-nitrogen, balanced fertilizer may be used.
