## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern Australia (New South Wales and eastern Victoria) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Dry Sclerophyll Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its natural habitat in open woodlands and forests. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is needed during establishment; once mature, it is drought-tolerant but benefits from infrequent deep watering during prolonged dry periods. |

## Introduction
Eucalyptus consideniana, commonly known as yertchuk, is a species of plant in the myrtle family and is endemic to south-eastern Australia. It is a tree with rough, fibrous, sometimes prickly bark on the trunk and larger branches, smooth grey bark above, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between eleven and nineteen, white flowers and conical to hemispherical fruit.

## Care Guide
Eucalyptus consideniana thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native temperate sclerophyll forests. It requires moderate water until established, then exhibits good drought tolerance. Fertilization should be minimal, focusing on low-phosphorus options to mimic its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs, particularly for phosphorus, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor Australian soils. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus native plant fertilizer if growth seems stunted.
