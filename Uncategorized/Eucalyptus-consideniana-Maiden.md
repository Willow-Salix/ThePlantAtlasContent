## 🧤 Care Instructions
Eucalyptus consideniana thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native temperate sclerophyll forests. It requires moderate water until established, then exhibits good drought tolerance. Fertilization should be minimal, focusing on low-phosphorus options to mimic its natural environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs, particularly for phosphorus, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor Australian soils. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus native plant fertilizer if growth seems stunted.
