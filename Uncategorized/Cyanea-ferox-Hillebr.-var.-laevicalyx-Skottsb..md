## Care Guide
This rare Hawaiian plant requires conditions similar to its native tropical montane wet forest habitat on Maui. Provide bright, indirect light, high humidity, and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Fertilize lightly during the growing season to support its health and unique needs.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize monthly during the growing season (spring through early fall) with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer to support lush growth in nutrient-rich but often leached forest soils.
