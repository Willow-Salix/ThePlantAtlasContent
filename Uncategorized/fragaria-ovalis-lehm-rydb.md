## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Fuzzy-fruited Strawberry thrives in temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Provide moderate fertilization, especially during active growth and fruiting, to support its health and berry production. Ensure adequate moisture without waterlogging, mimicking its native habitat along streams and in open woodlands.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate nutrient needs. Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose organic fertilizer application in early spring and potentially once more during the growing season, particularly when actively fruiting.
