## Introduction
The Cyperaceae () are a family of  graminoid (grass-like), monocotyledonous flowering plants known as sedges. The family is large; botanists have described some 5,500 known species in about 90 genera – the largest being the "true sedges" (genus Carex), with over 2,000 species.

## Care Guide
This wetland sedge thrives in cool, temperate conditions with consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its natural bog and fen habitats. It prefers bright light but is adaptable, and requires only low to moderate fertilization as it's accustomed to less nutrient-rich environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season (spring/summer).
