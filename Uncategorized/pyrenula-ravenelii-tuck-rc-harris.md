| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low light to partial shade, typical of a forest understory or tree bark protected by the canopy. Avoid direct, intense sunlight. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in high humidity and low to partial light, characteristic of its native humid subtropical forest habitat on tree bark. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and rain, thus traditional watering and fertilizing methods are unnecessary and potentially harmful.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens derive nutrients from air and rainfall; they are sensitive to pollutants and excess nutrients.
