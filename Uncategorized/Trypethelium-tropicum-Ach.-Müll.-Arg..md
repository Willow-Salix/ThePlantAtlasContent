# Tropic Trypethelium Lichen

*Trypethelium tropicum (Ach.) Müll. Arg.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas (e.g., Central and South America, Florida) and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Subtropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to bright indirect light; as an epiphytic lichen, it typically grows under a canopy, avoiding harsh direct sun. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity is crucial; consistent moisture from frequent rainfall or regular misting. Avoid prolonged periods of dryness. |

## Introduction
Trypethelium is a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Trypetheliaceae. The widespread genus contains about 50 species predominantly found in tropical areas. Trypethelium was circumscribed by German botanist Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel in 1804.

## Care Guide
Tropic Trypethelium Lichen thrives in warm, humid environments with filtered light, typical of tropical rainforests. It requires high atmospheric humidity and consistent moisture from misting or rain, absorbing all necessary nutrients directly from the air and water, thus needing no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
None required. Lichens are self-sufficient, absorbing all necessary nutrients directly from the air and rainfall; artificial fertilizers can be detrimental.
