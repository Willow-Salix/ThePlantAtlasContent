## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in bright light and very high atmospheric humidity, replicating its native fog desert environment. Ensure excellent air circulation to prevent prolonged wetness, and avoid any direct watering or fertilization as it obtains nutrients from the air.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens obtain nutrients from the atmosphere and are highly sensitive to conventional fertilizers.
