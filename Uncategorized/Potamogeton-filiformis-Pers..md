## Introduction
Potamogeton is a genus of aquatic, mostly freshwater, plants of the family Potamogetonaceae. Most are known by the common name pondweed, although many unrelated plants may be called pondweed, such as Canadian pondweed (Elodea canadensis). The genus name means "river neighbor", originating from the Greek potamos (river) and geiton (neighbor).

## Care Guide
Slender Pondweed is an aquatic plant best suited for temperate to boreal freshwater environments. It requires constant submergence in fresh water with full to partial sun exposure. Ensure a nutrient-rich aquatic substrate and water column for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate to high nutrient levels, drawing nutrients from both the water column and the substrate (e.g., muddy or silty bottoms).
