| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, ideally 6+ hours of direct sunlight for best growth and fruiting. |

## Introduction
Mespilus, commonly called medlar, is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae containing the single species Mespilus germanica of southwest Asia. It is also found in some countries in the Balkans, especially in Albanian, Macedonian and Bulgarian regions, and in Azerbaijan and Caucasian Georgia. A second proposed species, Mespilus canescens, discovered in North America in 1990, proved to be a hybrid between M. germanica and one or more species of hawthorn, and is properly known as × Crataemespilus canescens.

## Care Guide
Mespilus thrives in full sun within a temperate woodland climate, requiring consistent but moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions. An annual application of balanced organic fertilizer or compost will support its growth. Ensure well-drained soil to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from an annual application of balanced organic fertilizer or well-rotted compost, especially in early spring. Avoid excessive fertilization.
