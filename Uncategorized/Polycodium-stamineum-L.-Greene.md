## Care Guide
The Deerberry thrives in temperate climates, preferring full sun to partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly. Once established, it is quite drought-tolerant.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; an acid-specific fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring if growth is poor or soil lacks nutrients.
