## 🧤 Care Instructions
Vicia hyrcanica prefers conditions similar to its native temperate forests: full sun to partial shade and consistent, moderate moisture. Its nitrogen-fixing capability means it has low fertilizer requirements, making it a relatively undemanding plant to cultivate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, significantly reducing its need for supplemental nitrogen. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, low-nitrogen formula if soil nutrients are poor.
