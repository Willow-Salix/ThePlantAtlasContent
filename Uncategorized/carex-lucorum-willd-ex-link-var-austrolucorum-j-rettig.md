## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Mountains (e.g., Blue Ridge Mountains) from Pennsylvania south to Georgia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (Humid Continental/Subtropical with distinct seasons) |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it often grows in open woodlands or forest edges, receiving filtered sunlight or morning sun with afternoon shade. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil. Mimicking its native habitat with moderate to high rainfall, it requires regular watering to keep the soil from drying out, especially during dry spells, but dislikes waterlogged conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Blue Ridge Sedge prefers conditions similar to its native temperate forest floor, requiring partial sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It thrives with regular watering to prevent drying out and benefits from low to moderate fertilization to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Forest soils are often rich in organic matter. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or compost in spring is generally sufficient, avoiding over-fertilization.
