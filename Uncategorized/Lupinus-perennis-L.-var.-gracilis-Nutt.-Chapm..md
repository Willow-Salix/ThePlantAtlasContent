## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Wild Lupine thrives in full to partial sun with well-drained soil, mimicking its native temperate grassland and woodland edge environment. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and generally needs little to no fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, preferring lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, especially nitrogen, as it is a nitrogen-fixing legume. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, sandy soils.
