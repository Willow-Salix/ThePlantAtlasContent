## Care Guide
This tropical lichen thrives in high humidity and indirect light, mimicking its natural rainforest environment. It requires consistent moisture through ambient humidity or misting, but should not be waterlogged. No traditional fertilization is needed as it absorbs nutrients from the air and its growing surface.

### Fertilizer
None; lichens acquire nutrients from the air and substrate, not through conventional fertilization.
