## Care Guide
This tropical savanna grass thrives in full sun and requires consistent moisture during its active growth period, though it can endure brief dry spells. Provide moderate fertilization to support its growth, mimicking the varying soil conditions of its native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer.
