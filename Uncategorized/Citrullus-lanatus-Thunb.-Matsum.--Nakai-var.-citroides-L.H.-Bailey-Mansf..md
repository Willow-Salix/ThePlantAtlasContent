## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern Africa (e.g., Sudan, Egypt) |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid Savanna/Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its origin in open, sun-drenched environments with minimal canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Needs consistent and deep watering, particularly during flowering and fruit development, to support its water-rich fruits. Can tolerate some drought once established but ample moisture is crucial for fruit quality. |

## Introduction
The watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a species of flowering plant in the family Cucurbitaceae, that has a large, edible fruit. It is a scrambling and trailing vine-like plant, and is widely cultivated worldwide, with more than 1,000 varieties.
Watermelons are grown in favorable climates from tropical to temperate regions worldwide for its large edible fruit, which is a berry with a hard rind and no internal divisions, and is botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds, although seedless varieties exist. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled, and the rind is edible after cooking. It may also be consumed as a juice or an ingredient in mixed beverages.
Kordofan melons from Sudan are the closest relatives and may be progenitors of modern, cultivated watermelons. Wild watermelon seeds were found in Uan Muhuggiag, a prehistoric site in Libya that dates to approximately 3500 BC. In 2022, a study was released that traced 6,000-year-old watermelon seeds found in the Libyan desert to the Egusi seeds of Nigeria, West Africa. Watermelons were domesticated in Sudan and cultivated in Egypt by 2000 BC, although they were not the sweet modern variety. Sweet dessert watermelons spread across the Mediterranean world during Roman times.
Considerable breeding effort has developed disease-resistant varieties. Many cultivars are available that produce mature fruit within 100 days of planting. As of 2023, China is the world's leading producer of watermelons with 64% of the total.

## Care Guide
Watermelons demand full sun exposure and consistent, deep watering throughout their growing season, particularly when setting fruit. Plant in rich, well-draining soil and provide regular fertilization to support robust growth and sweet, juicy fruit development.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in nutrient-rich, well-draining soil. Benefits from regular fertilization, especially with high-phosphorus and potassium fertilizers during fruiting, to support vigorous growth and large fruit production.
