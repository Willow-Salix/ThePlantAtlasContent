## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Subarctic regions, including northern North America (e.g., northern Manitoba, Quebec, Newfoundland, Greenland), northern Europe (e.g., Iceland, Svalbard), and arctic Russia. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Subarctic Boreal zones |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade during the growing season, adapted to open, exposed tundra environments with long daylight hours. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil is crucial, especially during the short, active growing season, mimicking meltwater and often waterlogged conditions of its native habitat. Avoid prolonged drought. |

## Introduction
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## Care Guide
Hartz's bluegrass is a hardy plant native to cold, circumpolar arctic and subarctic regions. It requires full sun to partial shade and consistently moist soil, especially during its brief growing season, thriving in conditions that mimic its native tundra environment with low nutrient availability. Avoid drought and excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilization; this species is adapted to nutrient-poor tundra soils. Excessive fertilization should be avoided.
