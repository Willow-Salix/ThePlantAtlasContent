## Care Guide
This San Francisco Wallflower variety is a drought-tolerant plant best suited for full sun and excellent drainage. It thrives in lean soils, requiring minimal watering primarily during cooler, wetter seasons. Avoid over-fertilization to maintain its health and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Prefers lean to poor, well-drained soils; little to no fertilizer is needed. Rich fertilization can be detrimental.
