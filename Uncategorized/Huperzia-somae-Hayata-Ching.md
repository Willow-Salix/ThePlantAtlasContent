## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Taiwan (specifically mountainous regions) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect bright light to partial shade. This plant prefers filtered light, mimicking its natural understory or sheltered habitat within forests. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, but not waterlogged, conditions. High humidity is crucial; regular misting or placement in a humid environment (e.g., terrarium) is highly beneficial. |

## Introduction
Huperzia is a genus of lycophyte plants, sometimes known as the firmosses or fir clubmosses; the Flora of North America calls them gemma fir-mosses. This genus was originally included in the related genus Lycopodium, from which it differs in having undifferentiated sporangial leaves, and the sporangia not formed into apical cones.  The common name firmoss, used for some of the north temperate species, refers to their superficial resemblance to branches of fir (Abies), a conifer. As of 2020, two very different circumscriptions of the genus were in use. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Huperzia is one of three genera in the subfamily Huperzioideae of the family Lycopodiaceae. Most species in the subfamily are placed in the genus Phlegmariurus. Huperzia is left with about 25 species, although not all have been formally transferred to other genera. Other sources recognize only Huperzia, which then has about 340 species.

## Care Guide
To care for Oriental Clubmoss, replicate its native montane forest environment by providing consistent moisture, very high humidity, and indirect bright light or partial shade. Use a well-draining medium and fertilize sparingly to support its growth without overwhelming its delicate root system.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient. Use a highly diluted balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring/summer), as these plants are not heavy feeders and can be sensitive to excess salts.
