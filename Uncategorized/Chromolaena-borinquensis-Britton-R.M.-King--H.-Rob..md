## Introduction
Chromolaena is a genus of about 165 species of perennials and shrubs in the family Asteraceae. The name is derived from the Greek words χρῶμα (khrôma), meaning "color", and χλαῑνα (khlaīna) or λαῑνα (laīna) meaning "cloak". It refers to the colored phyllaries of some species. Members of the genus are native to the Americas, from the southern United States to South America (especially Brazil).  One species, Chromolaena odorata, has been introduced to many parts of the world where it is considered a weed.
The plants of this genus were earlier taxonomically classified under the genus Eupatorium, but are now considered to be more closely related to other genera in the tribe Eupatorieae.
