## Care Guide
This plant thrives in open, sunny to partially shaded environments with consistently moist, well-drained, sandy or peaty soils. Originating from temperate grasslands and coastal plains, it appreciates regular moisture without becoming waterlogged and has relatively low nutrient requirements, making light fertilization adequate.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; prefers lean to moderately rich soils. Excessive fertilization can hinder growth. A balanced, diluted fertilizer can be applied sparingly if nutrient deficiency is observed.
