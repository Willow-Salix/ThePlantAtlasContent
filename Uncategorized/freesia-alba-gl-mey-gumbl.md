## 🌱 Overview
Freesia is a genus of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae, first described as a genus in 1866 by Christian Friedrich Ecklon (1886) and named after the German botanist and medical practitioner, Friedrich Freese (1795–1876). It is native to the eastern side of southern Africa, from Kenya south to South Africa, most species being found in Cape Provinces. Species of the former genus Anomatheca are now included in Freesia. The plants commonly known as "freesias", with fragrant funnel-shaped flowers, are cultivated hybrids of a number of Freesia species. Some other species are also grown as ornamental plants.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
White Freesia thrives in bright, sunny conditions reminiscent of its Mediterranean native habitat. Provide consistent moisture during its active growth and blooming phase in spring, then allow the soil to dry out as it enters summer dormancy. Light fertilization will support its beautiful, fragrant flowers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed lightly with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during active growth until flowering. Cease fertilization during the dormancy period.
