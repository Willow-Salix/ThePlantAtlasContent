## Care Guide
Hairy Bradburia thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native arid and chaparral habitats. It requires infrequent watering once established and is highly drought-tolerant, with minimal to no fertilizer needs. This plant is an excellent choice for xeriscaping or dry garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Native soils in arid scrubland and chaparral are often nutrient-poor; over-fertilization can be detrimental. If necessary, a light, balanced fertilizer in spring may be used for plants in very poor soil.
