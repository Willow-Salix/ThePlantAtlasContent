## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (high elevations on Maui, Molokaʻi, and Hawaiʻi) |
| **Climate** | Subalpine Wet Grassland / Bog |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native high-elevation bog habitat, it receives bright light often diffused by frequent cloud cover, suggesting tolerance for both intense direct sun and periods of lower light due to atmospheric conditions. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist to wet, never allowing it to dry out. Mimic bog-like conditions with high humidity and frequent moisture; water thoroughly and regularly. |

## Introduction
Deschampsia is a genus of plants in the grass family Poaceae, commonly known as hair grass or tussock grass. The genus is widespread across many countries.
The genus is named for French physician and naturalist Louis Auguste Deschamps (1765–1842).
Deschampsia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera, including antler moth, the clay, clouded-bordered brindle, common wainscot, dark arches, dusky brocade, shoulder-striped wainscot, smoky wainscot and wall.
Deschampsia sometimes grow in boggy acidic formations, an example of which is the Portlethen Moss, Scotland. 
Deschampsia antarctica is the world's most southern monocot, and one of only two flowering plants of Antarctica.
Some species, such as D. cespitosa, are grown as ornamental garden plants.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian high-elevation hairgrass thrives in consistently moist to wet, acidic soils and high humidity. Provide full sun to partial shade, protecting it from extreme heat. Minimal fertilization is required to support its growth in bog-like conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low nutrient requirements. Fertilize sparingly with a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season, if absolutely necessary, as bog environments are typically nutrient-poor.
