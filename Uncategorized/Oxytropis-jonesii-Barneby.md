## 🌱 Overview
Oxytropis is a genus of plants in the legume family. It includes over 600 species native to subarctic to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. It is one of three genera of plants known as locoweeds, and are notorious for being toxic to grazing animals. The other locoweed genus is the closely related Astragalus. Most oxtropis species are native to Eurasia and North America, but several species are native to the Arctic. These are hairy perennial plants which produce raceme inflorescences of pink, purple, white, or yellow flowers which are generally pea-like but have distinctive sharply beaked keels. The stems are leafless, the leaves being all basal. The plant produces legume pods containing the seeds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its high-altitude native habitat. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings, and avoid rich fertilizers to ensure optimal growth and health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils; fertilizer is generally not required and can be detrimental.
