## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern and Central United States, particularly Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas. |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6-8+ hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and fruit production, mimicking its native exposure in open woodlands and along riverbanks. |
| **Watering** | Consistent, moderate watering, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between applications. More frequent watering may be needed during hot, dry periods, reflecting the moderate to high rainfall of its native climate but avoiding waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Vitis (grapevine) is a genus of 81 accepted species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae.  The genus consists of species predominantly from the Northern Hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture.
Most cultivated Vitis varieties are wind-pollinated with hermaphroditic flowers containing both male and female reproductive structures, while wild species are dioecious. These flowers are grouped in bunches called inflorescences. In many species, such as Vitis vinifera, each successfully pollinated flower becomes a grape berry with the inflorescence turning into a cluster of grapes. While the flowers of the grapevines are usually very small, the berries are often large and brightly colored with sweet flavors that attract birds and other animals to disperse the seeds contained within the berries.
Grapevines usually only produce fruit on shoots that came from buds that were developed during the previous growing season. In viticulture, this is one of the principles behind pruning the previous year's growth (or "One year old wood") that includes shoots that have turned hard and woody during the winter (after harvest in commercial viticulture). These vines will be pruned either into a cane which will support 8 to 15 buds or to a smaller spur which holds 2 to 3 buds.

## Care Guide
Heller's grape thrives in full sun and requires consistent, moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications. It benefits from rich, well-draining soil enhanced with organic matter and a balanced fertilizer during its active growing season. Ensure good air circulation and sturdy support for its vining habit.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from fertile, well-draining soil. Amend soil with organic matter to mimic rich woodland soils. Apply a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in early spring and potentially mid-summer during the active growing season.
