## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (endemic) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest / Montane Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light or dappled sunlight. Avoid harsh, direct afternoon sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. High ambient humidity is crucial, so regular misting or placement near a humidifier is beneficial. |

## Introduction
Cheirodendron platyphyllum, also known as lapalapa, is a species of flowering plant in the ginseng family, Araliaceae, that is endemic to the islands of Oʻahu and Kauaʻi in Hawaii.  It is a small tree, reaching a height of 8 m (26 ft) and a trunk diameter of 20 cm (7.9 in).  Lapalapa inhabits wet forests and bogs at elevations of 670–1,520 m (2,200–4,990 ft).

## Care Guide
Lapalapa thrives in conditions mimicking its native Hawaiian wet forests, requiring bright, indirect light, consistently moist well-draining soil, and high humidity. Protect it from intense direct sun and provide moderate fertilization during its growing period for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in the fall and winter.
