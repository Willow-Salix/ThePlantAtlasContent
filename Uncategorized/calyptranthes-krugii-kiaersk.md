## 🧤 Care Instructions
Limoncillo flourishes in warm, humid environments similar to its native Caribbean tropical moist forests. Provide consistent moisture and ensure well-draining soil while offering bright, indirect light to partial sun exposure. Moderate fertilization during the growing season will support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer), less in fall and winter.
