## Introduction
Ramonia is a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Gyalectaceae. It contains 24 species. The genus was circumscribed by Ernst Stizenberger in 1862.
The genus name of Ramonia is in honour of Ramón Dionisio José de la Sagra (1798–1871), who was a Spanish anarchist, politician, writer, and botanist who founded the world's first anarchist journal, El Porvenir (Spanish for "The Future").

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical humid forest habitat. Provide consistently high humidity and low to medium indirect light, ensuring it never fully dries out for prolonged periods. Avoid using any traditional fertilizers, as it relies on atmospheric nutrients.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. As a lichen, it absorbs nutrients directly from the atmosphere and rainwater; typical plant fertilizers would be detrimental.
