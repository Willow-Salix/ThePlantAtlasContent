## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, including eastern Canada (e.g., Labrador, Quebec, Ontario) and northeastern United States, extending west to the Great Lakes region and south along the Appalachian Mountains. |
| **Climate** | Temperate and Boreal Forest biomes, often found in moist woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial to full shade, mimicking its native understory habitat. Can tolerate some morning sun in cooler climates if the soil remains consistently moist. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, reflecting its natural preference for damp environments. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions, replicating its natural temperate and boreal woodland environment. Ensure the soil remains consistently damp, but never waterlogged, and provide protection from harsh afternoon sun. A light feeding in spring supports robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a light application of a balanced, slow-release or organic fertilizer in early spring, consistent with the moderately rich, organic soils of its native forest floor.
