## 🧤 Care Instructions
Alpine Forget-me-nots, commonly encountered as garden plants under this name, thrive in cool, moist conditions with partial shade, though they can tolerate full sun in cooler climates. They require consistently moist, well-draining soil rich in organic matter. Provide minimal fertilizer, as overfeeding can reduce flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers moderately fertile, humus-rich soil. Benefits from light feeding with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer or compost incorporated annually, but avoid over-fertilizing.
