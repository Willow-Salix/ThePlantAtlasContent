## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of Europe and North America |
| **Climate** | Temperate Rocky Outcrops (specifically on calcareous rocks) |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to bright indirect light is ideal. Can tolerate some direct morning sun but should be shielded from intense, prolonged afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires intermittent hydration, such as regular misting or brief immersion, followed by complete drying periods. Simulates natural rainfall and desiccation cycles common to exposed rock surfaces. |

## Introduction
Staurothele is a genus of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), crustose lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. It has about 40 species. When the fungus is part of a lichen, the genus of lichen is commonly called rock pimples.

## Care Guide
Wart Lichen thrives on calcareous rocks in temperate, moderate-light environments. Its care involves mimicking natural wet-dry cycles through periodic hydration and allowing full desiccation, with no need for fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens absorb trace nutrients from the air and water; artificial fertilizers are unnecessary and potentially detrimental.
