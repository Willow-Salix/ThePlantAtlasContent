| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest; Humid Montane Forest (often epiphytic or lithophytic) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Mimics understory conditions or filtered light received by epiphytes. Avoid direct, harsh sunlight which can scorch leaves. |

## Care Guide
Hillia plants require a humid environment with bright, indirect light, mirroring their native tropical rainforest habitat. Maintain consistent moisture in a well-draining substrate and provide diluted, regular fertilization to support their epiphytic growth style.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half or quarter strength, applied every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. As an epiphyte, it is not accustomed to rich soil nutrients.
