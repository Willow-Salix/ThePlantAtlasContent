## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Boreal and subpolar regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, including Scandinavia, North America, Patagonia, and Antarctica |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Boreal Forest and Subpolar Alpine |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun; typically found on host lichens in exposed yet often humid environments |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity is critical; requires consistent moisture from rain, fog, or snowmelt. Traditional watering for soil-bound plants is not applicable as it grows on lichens. |

## Introduction
Biatoropsis is a genus of lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) fungi of uncertain familial placement in the order Tremellales. It comprises 11 species that parasitise various species in the fruticose lichen genera Usnea and Protousnea.

## Care Guide
As a lichenicolous fungus, Biatoropsis usnearum Rasanen requires its specific *Usnea* host and thrives in cool, humid conditions with good air circulation and moderate light. Traditional plant care strategies (soil, watering, fertilizer) are not relevant; focus on maintaining its native atmospheric environment.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. This lichenicolous fungus obtains all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere and its *Usnea* host lichen. Supplemental fertilization is not beneficial and can be harmful.
