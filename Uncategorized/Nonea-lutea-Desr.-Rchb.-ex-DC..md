## Care Guide
Yellow Monkswort flourishes in full sun, typical of its native Mediterranean and temperate habitats. It requires moderate watering, preferring soil to dry between sessions and showing good drought tolerance once established. This adaptable plant has low to moderate fertilizer needs, thriving in average soil without intensive feeding.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring may be beneficial in very nutrient-depleted soils.
