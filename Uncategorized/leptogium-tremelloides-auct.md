## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in consistently high humidity and frequent moisture, mimicking its native tropical humid forest environment. It requires low to moderate indirect light and should never be exposed to direct harsh sun. Avoid traditional fertilizers, as it obtains nutrients from the air and rainfall.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air and rainfall and can be sensitive to chemical fertilizers and pollutants.
