## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (primarily the Great Basin region, including parts of Nevada, Utah, Oregon, Idaho, and California) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Temperate Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (requires direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day, mimicking its open desert habitat) |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, deep watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. This plant is highly drought-tolerant due to its native arid climate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Great Basin Desertparsley thrives in full sun and requires infrequent watering, reflecting its native arid scrubland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and needs very little to no fertilizer, adapting well to lean soils. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental. If desired, a very dilute, balanced slow-release fertilizer once in early spring.
