## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate forests across Europe and North America |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; thrives in shaded conditions, away from direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires high humidity and consistent moisture, absorbing water directly from the air and rainfall. Misting can supplement humidity in drier environments, but it does not require watering into soil. |

## Introduction
Agyrium is a genus of saprophytic fungi in the family Agyriaceae.  It probably evolved from a lichen ancestor, as it is closely related to many lichenized species of fungi.

## Care Guide
Successful care for Agyrium lichen involves mimicking its native temperate forest environment, emphasizing high humidity, consistent moisture, and good air circulation in a shaded location. It does not require soil or traditional fertilization, obtaining its needs from the atmosphere and the surface it grows on.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required; this lichen obtains all necessary nutrients from the air, rain, and its substrate.
