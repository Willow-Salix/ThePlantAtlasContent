## Care Guide
The Desert Hackberry is a hardy plant perfectly adapted to arid environments. It requires full sun, very infrequent watering once established, and thrives without the need for additional fertilizers. This makes it an excellent, low-maintenance choice for drought-prone landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in poor, rocky, and low-nutrient soils typical of desert regions.
