## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Savanna/Grassland (e.g., Cerrado, Pampa) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers ample direct sunlight, mimicking its open grassland native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Allow the topsoil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during periods of dormancy or cooler months, to simulate natural wet and dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Ditaxis is a plant genus of the family Euphorbiaceae first described as a genus in 1824. Its name comes from Greek dis ("two") and taxis ("rank"), referring to the stamens which are in two whorls. The genus is widespread across much of the Western Hemisphere from the southern United States to Uruguay.

## Care Guide
Ditaxis lanceolata thrives in conditions that mimic its native subtropical savannas, requiring full sun exposure and well-draining soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and provide light fertilization during its growing period. This strategy supports its adaptation to seasonal rainfall and open environments.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Apply a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
