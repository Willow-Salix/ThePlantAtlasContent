## Introduction
Tripleurospermum is a genus in the chamomile tribe within the  sunflower family. Mayweed is a common name for plants in this genus.
Most of the species are from Europe and temperate Asia although a few are from North America and North Africa.  The species are placed in Matricaria by some authors.
Plants typically have lobed leaves that are composed of one to three opposite pairs cut almost to the leaf mid rib: they have indehiscent one-celled fruits that have 3-ribs and two resinous glands at the base, Matricaria species are distinguished from these species by lacking fruits with 3-ribs and the two glands.

## Care Guide
This plant flourishes in full sun conditions, typical of its native Central Asian steppes. It is adapted to moderate to low water availability, tolerating periods of dryness between waterings, and requires minimal fertilization. Provide well-draining soil to mimic its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native soils are often lean to moderately fertile, so heavy fertilization is unnecessary. A light, balanced feed in spring may suffice.
