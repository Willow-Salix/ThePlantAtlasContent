## 🌱 Overview
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Scented Pussytoes thrives in full sun and very well-drained, rocky soil, mimicking its native alpine habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, along with minimal to no fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. An annual light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in very poor soils, but often unnecessary.
