## Care Guide
Warnock's Ragwort thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native arid scrubland habitat. Water sparingly, only when the soil is completely dry, to prevent root rot. It is a low-maintenance plant that needs very little fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; if necessary, a very light application of a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the growing season.
