## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains and other high-elevation ranges in states like Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it thrives above the treeline in open, exposed environments. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil during its short growing season, provided by snowmelt, but with excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging and root rot. It tolerates some temporary dryness once established. |

## Introduction
Ranunculus  is a large genus of about 1750 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Members of the genus are known as buttercups, spearworts and water crowfoots.
The genus is distributed worldwide, primarily in temperate and montane regions. The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, which has extremely tough and tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much taller meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris. In ornamental  gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.
Buttercups usually flower in the spring, but flowers may be found throughout the summer, especially where the plants are growing as opportunistic colonizers, as in the case of garden weeds.
The water crowfoots (Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium), which grow in still or running water, are sometimes treated in a separate genus Batrachium (from Greek βάτραχος bátrakhos, "frog"). They have two different leaf types, thread-like leaves underwater and broader floating leaves. In some species, such as R. aquatilis, a third, intermediate leaf type occurs.
Ranunculus species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Hebrew character and small angle shades. Some species are popular ornamental flowers in horticulture, with many cultivars selected for large and brightly coloured flowers.

## Care Guide
The Tundra Buttercup thrives in conditions mimicking its native alpine tundra, requiring full sun exposure and consistently moist yet extremely well-drained soil. Minimal to no fertilization is necessary, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Ensure good drainage to prevent root issues, especially in colder, wetter conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilization is needed; this plant is adapted to the lean, rocky, and nutrient-poor soils characteristic of alpine tundra.
