## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (primarily northeastern USA and southeastern Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Wetland/Meadow (within Temperate Deciduous Forest biome) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to dappled shade. Prefers bright conditions without direct, harsh midday sun, which can scorch its leaves. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist; thrives in perpetually moist to wet soil conditions. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, but the substrate should never be allowed to dry out completely. |

## Introduction
The genus Platanthera belongs to the subfamily Orchidoideae of the family Orchidaceae, and comprises about 150 species of orchids. The members of this genus, known as the butterfly orchids or fringed orchids, were previously included in the genus Orchis, which is a close relative (along with the genus Habenaria). They are distributed throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are terrestrial and have tubercules. The genomes of Platanthera zijinensis and Platanthera guangdongensis have been sequenced as model species to study partial and full mycoheterotrophy.

## Care Guide
This temperate terrestrial orchid thrives in consistently moist, well-drained soil under partial sun to dappled shade, mimicking its native bog and meadow habitats. Maintain moderate to high humidity and apply a very dilute fertilizer sparingly to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Use a very dilute, balanced fertilizer sparingly during the active growing season. Benefits from organically rich soil.
