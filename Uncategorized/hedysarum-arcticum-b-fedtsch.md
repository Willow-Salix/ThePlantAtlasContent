## 🧤 Care Instructions
Arctic Sweetvetch thrives in very cold, full sun conditions with exceptionally well-drained, poor soils. It needs moderate watering only during its short summer growing period, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and requires little to no fertilizer. Mimic its arctic tundra habitat for best results.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to None; as a nitrogen-fixing legume adapted to nutrient-poor tundra soils, it requires minimal to no supplemental fertilizer. Avoid rich soils.
