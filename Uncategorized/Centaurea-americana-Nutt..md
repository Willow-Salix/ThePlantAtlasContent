| **Native Origin** | Central and Southern United States (including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana) and Northern Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Prairie |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established due to its adaptation to prairie conditions with intermittent rainfall. |

## Introduction
Centaurea () is a genus of over 700 species of herbaceous thistle-like flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Members of the genus are found only north of the equator, mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere; the Middle East and surrounding regions are particularly species-rich.

## Care Guide
This resilient prairie native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring conditions that mimic its open grassland habitat. It tolerates drought once established and requires moderate watering, with minimal fertilization generally needed.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; typically thrives in average to moderately fertile soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil nutrients are poor.
