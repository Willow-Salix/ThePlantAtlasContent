## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern Australia, specifically New South Wales and Queensland, particularly the New England Tableland and adjacent high-altitude regions. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Highland/Temperate Woodland, characterized by cooler temperatures and moderate to high rainfall, often in wet sclerophyll forests. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun is essential, as it naturally grows in open woodlands and forest canopies, requiring direct sunlight for vigorous growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistent moisture, especially when young, reflecting its native habitat's rainfall. Established plants can tolerate periods of dryness but thrive with moderate, regular watering in well-drained soil. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eucalyptus campanulata, commonly known as the New England blackbutt, gum-topped peppermint or New England ash, is a tree that is endemic to eastern Australia. It has rough, finely fibrous greyish bark on the trunk and larger branches, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds arranged in groups of between eleven and fifteen, white flowers and cup-shaped to conical fruit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This eucalypt thrives in full sun and requires well-drained soil with moderate, consistent watering, particularly during establishment. Avoid over-fertilization, especially with high phosphorus, as it is adapted to nutrient-lean conditions. Mimic its open woodland environment for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization is sufficient, as eucalypts are adapted to nutrient-poor Australian soils. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer if necessary, otherwise, well-draining soil with some organic matter is usually enough.
