## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Greater Antilles (Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet and Dry (Savanna) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **Watering** | Maintain consistent moisture during active growth, allowing the top inch of soil to dry between waterings. Reduce frequency significantly during cooler or drier periods. |

## Introduction
Chamaecrista is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Members of the genus are commonly known as sensitive pea. Several species are capable of rapid plant movement. Unlike the related genera Cassia and Senna, members of Chamaecrista form root nodules.
Chamaecrista has 367 species, with a wide distribution – the Americas from Minnesota to northern Argentina, sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Iran, the Indian Subcontinent, Indochina, China, Korea, Japan, Malesia, New Guinea, and Australia.

## Care Guide
The Narrowpod Sensitive Pea thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical savanna environment, requiring abundant sunlight and consistent moisture during its active growing phase. As a legume, it benefits from lighter fertilization, especially avoiding high nitrogen, and prefers a well-draining soil.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring/summer) with a balanced or lower-nitrogen formula, as this legume may fix its own nitrogen.
