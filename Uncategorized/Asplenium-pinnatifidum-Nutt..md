## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (specifically the Appalachian Mountains and surrounding regions) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest / Rocky Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade; indirect or filtered light, mimicking the forest understory or rocky crevices. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water when the top inch of substrate feels dry, ensuring good drainage. |

## Introduction
Asplenium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the lobed spleenwort or pinnatifid spleenwort, is a small fern found principally in the Appalachian Mountains and the Shawnee Hills, growing in rock crevices in moderately acid to subacid strata. Originally identified as a variety of walking fern (Asplenium rhizophyllum), it was classified as a separate species by Thomas Nuttall in 1818. It is believed to have originated by chromosome doubling in a hybrid between walking fern and mountain spleenwort (Asplenium montanum), producing a fertile tetraploid, a phenomenon known as alloploidy; however, the hypothesized parental hybrid has never been located. It is intermediate in morphology between the parent species: while its leaf blades are long and tapering like that of walking fern, the influence of mountain spleenwort means that the blades are lobed, rather than whole. A. pinnatifidum can itself form sterile hybrids with several other spleenworts.

## Care Guide
This fern thrives in cool, humid conditions with consistent moisture, preferring indirect or filtered light. Plant in a well-draining, slightly acidic medium and fertilize sparingly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; a very diluted liquid fertilizer (quarter to half strength) once a month during the growing season (spring/summer) is sufficient, or none if the potting mix is rich.
