# Kura Clover
### *Trifolium ambiguum M. Bieb.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Caucasus region, Eastern Europe (e.g., Russia, Ukraine, Romania), Turkey, Iran |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is preferred, reflecting its open steppe habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering is needed, especially during establishment, to mimic natural rainfall. Once established, its deep root system makes it highly drought-tolerant, requiring less frequent watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Kura Clover thrives in full sun conditions characteristic of its native temperate steppes and grasslands. It needs moderate watering during its initial growth phase but becomes exceptionally drought-tolerant once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires minimal nitrogen fertilizer, though phosphorus and potassium can be beneficial in poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires very little to no nitrogen fertilizer. It may benefit from phosphorus and potassium in soils deficient in these nutrients.
