## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring infrequent deep watering once established. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has low fertilizer needs and is well-suited for xeriscaping or rock gardens in appropriate climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring might be beneficial in very poor soils, but generally, it thrives without much supplementation.
