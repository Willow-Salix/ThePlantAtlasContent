## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwest Western Australia |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in high light exposure typical of open woodlands and coastal areas. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering during establishment, then drought-tolerant. Benefits from moisture during cooler, wetter periods and can withstand dry summers, but requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Albizia is a genus of more than 160 species of mostly fast-growing subtropical and tropical trees and shrubs in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the family Fabaceae. The genus is pantropical, occurring in Asia, Africa, Madagascar, America and Australia, but mostly in the Old World tropics. In some locations, some species are considered weeds.
They are commonly called silk plants, silk trees, or sirises. The obsolete spelling of the generic name – with double 'z' – is still common, so the plants may be called albizzias. The generic name honors the Italian nobleman Filippo degli Albizzi, who introduced Albizia julibrissin to Europe in the mid-18th century. Some species are commonly called mimosa, which more accurately refers to plants of genus Mimosa. Species from southeast Asia used for timber are sometime termed East Indian walnut.

## Care Guide
This adaptable plant thrives in full sun with well-draining soil, reflecting its Mediterranean native climate. It requires regular watering during its establishment phase but becomes quite drought-tolerant once mature. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as this legume fixes its own nitrogen. Minimal feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer is usually sufficient, especially for established plants in moderately fertile soils.
