## Introduction
Tilia is a genus of about 30 species of trees or bushes, native throughout most of the temperate Northern Hemisphere. The species are known as linden or lime for the European and Asian species, and linden or basswood for North American species and more generally in American literature. The greatest species diversity is found in Asia, but the genus also occurs widely in Europe and eastern North America. Under the Cronquist classification system, this genus was placed in the family Tiliaceae, but genetic research summarised by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has resulted in the incorporation of this genus, and of most of the previous family, into the Malvaceae.
Tilia is the only known ectomycorrhizal genus in the family Malvaceae. Studies of ectomycorrhizal relations of Tilia species indicate a wide range of fungal symbionts and a preference toward Ascomycota fungal partners.

## Care Guide
This temperate forest tree thrives with full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native habitat. Ensure regular watering during dry spells and provide moderate fertilization in spring to promote healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization in spring with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or enrichment with organic compost to support robust growth.
