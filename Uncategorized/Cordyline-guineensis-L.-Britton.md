## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical West Africa (e.g., Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade. Thrives in indirect, filtered light, mimicking its natural understory habitat in dense forests. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil. Water frequently, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly between waterings, but never letting it dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Cordyline is a genus of about 24 species of woody monocotyledonous flowering plants in family Asparagaceae, subfamily Lomandroideae. The subfamily has previously been treated as a separate family Laxmanniaceae, or Lomandraceae. Other authors have placed the genus in the Agavaceae (now Agavoideae). Cordyline is native to the western Pacific Ocean region, from New Zealand, eastern Australia, southeastern Asia and Polynesia, with one species found in southeastern South America.
The name Cordyline comes from the Greek word kordyle, meaning "club," a reference to the enlarged underground stems or rhizomes.

## Care Guide
Mimicking its tropical rainforest origin, Cordyline guineensis requires high humidity, consistent moisture in the soil, and indirect light. Protect it from direct sun exposure and provide moderate feeding during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season. Use a balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength every 2-4 weeks from spring to early autumn.
