## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North American mountainous regions, including parts of Western and Eastern North America (e.g., Alaska, Yukon, British Columbia, Quebec, Newfoundland), primarily in alpine and subalpine zones. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, exposed conditions typical of high-altitude environments. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil is crucial, especially during the growing season. Mimic conditions of regular snowmelt and alpine precipitation. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This alpine willow prefers cool temperatures and ample sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or cooler climates. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and benefits from minimal fertilization to thrive.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer applied once in early spring is generally sufficient for its needs.
