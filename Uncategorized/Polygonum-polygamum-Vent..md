## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical/Warm Temperate (Pine flatwoods, sandhills, scrub habitats with dry, sandy soils) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it naturally grows in open, exposed areas. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and requires excellent drainage. |

## Introduction
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, characteristic of its native Southeastern U.S. scrub and flatwood habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, along with very low fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor, sandy soils and generally requires minimal to no supplemental fertilization.
