## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America, Caribbean Islands (e.g., Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Costa Rica) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforests, Cloud Forests, Montane Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect light to partial shade, mimicking the understory or filtered light conditions of its native tropical forest habitat. Avoid direct, harsh afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry, ensuring good drainage. Avoid letting the plant sit in standing water, but do not allow the soil to completely dry out. |

## Introduction
Miconia is a genus of flowering plants in the glory bush family, Melastomataceae, native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Americas. The species are mostly shrubs and small to medium-sized trees up to 15 m tall. The generic name honours Catalan physician and botanist Francesc Micó. Some species are known by the common name johnnyberry.
Many species are threatened by habitat destruction in their native range, and some are feared to be on the brink of extinction. On the other hand, M. calvescens is a contributing factor in the decline and maybe even extinction of other plants: it has become a highly invasive weed on a number of Pacific Islands where it was introduced, including Hawaii and Tahiti. It is often referred to as the "purple plague" or the "green cancer" in reference to its habit of overgrowing native ecosystems, and its leaves which are bright green above and bright purple below.
Miconia fruit are a favorite food of many birds (invasive M. calvescens spreads by this route). The leaves of some species are eaten by caterpillars of the moth-butterflies (Hedylidae).

## Care Guide
Miconia thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical origin, requiring bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. High humidity is also beneficial. Feed regularly during active growth for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks. Reduce or stop fertilizing in fall and winter.
