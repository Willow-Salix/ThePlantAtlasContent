## Introduction
In Greek mythology, the name Chloris (; Greek Χλωρίς Chlōrís, from χλωρός chlōrós, meaning "greenish-yellow", "pale green", "pale", "pallid", or "fresh") appears in a variety of contexts. Some clearly refer to different characters; other stories may refer to the same Chloris, but disagree on details.

Chloris, a nymph loved by Zephyrus (West Wind).
Chloris, wife of Neleus, king of Pylos. It is, however, not always clear whether she or the below Chloris is mentioned in this role.
Chloris, one of the Niobids.
Chloris, daughter of Orchomenus, married the seer Ampyx (son of Elatus or Titairon), with whom she had a child Mopsus who also became a renowned seer and would later join the Argonauts. The Argonautica Orphica calls her by a different name, Aregonis. In some accounts, she mothered Mopsus by Zeus.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant grass thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native arid climate. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly to prevent root rot. Fertilizer needs are minimal, aligning with its natural habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and generally does not require much fertilization; a very light, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient if growth appears poor.
