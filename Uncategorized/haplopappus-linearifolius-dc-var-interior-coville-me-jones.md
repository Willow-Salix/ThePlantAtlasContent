## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant requires full sun and excellent drainage, mimicking its native arid scrubland and desert environments. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and fertilize very infrequently if at all. It is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to harsh, dry conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; native desert soils are often nutrient-poor, so this plant thrives with minimal supplemental feeding.
