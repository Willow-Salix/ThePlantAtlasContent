## 🌱 Overview
Ipomoea () is the largest genus in the plant family Convolvulaceae, with over 600 species. It is a large and diverse group, with common names including morning glory, water convolvulus or water spinach, sweet potato, bindweed, moonflower, etc. The genus occurs throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and comprises annual and perennial herbaceous plants, lianas, shrubs, and small trees; most of the species are twining climbing plants.
Their most widespread common name is morning glory, but some species in related genera bear that same common name and some Ipomoea species are known by different common names. Those formerly separated in Calonyction (Greek καλός kalós "good" and νύξ, νυκτός núx, nuktós, "night") are called moonflowers. The name Ipomoea is derived from the Ancient Greek ἴψ, meaning 'woodworm', and ὅμοιος (hómoios), meaning "resembling". It refers to their twining habit.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Krug's white morning-glory thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native tropical dry forest environment. Provide regular watering during its active growth period, letting the soil dry slightly between sessions, and use a diluted fertilizer monthly for optimal health and bloom. It exhibits good drought tolerance once mature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Apply a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer at half strength monthly during the active growing season to support robust growth and flowering.
