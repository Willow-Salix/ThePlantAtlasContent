## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical South and Central America, including countries like Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and parts of the Caribbean. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light; simulate the dappled light of a forest understory. Avoid direct sunlight which can scorch fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly before rewatering. |

## 🌱 Overview
The moth genus Dryopteris is now considered a junior synonym of Oreta.

Dryopteris , commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to Dryopteris filix-mas), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales.
Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American Dryopteris hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization.
The fossil record of this genus shows that it was widespread even as far back as the Cretaceous with fossils being found in Late Cretaceous rock layers from North America down to Antarctica.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for this fern, replicate its tropical rainforest habitat by providing low to medium indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. High humidity is vital, often requiring misting or a pebble tray, and feed lightly during warmer months to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a diluted liquid fern fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease in fall and winter.
