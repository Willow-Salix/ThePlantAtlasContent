# Narrowleaf Carlowrightia

*Calophanes angusta A. Gray* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), tolerating intense heat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly in cooler months. |

## Care Guide
This resilient shrub thrives in full sun and well-draining conditions, mirroring its arid native habitat. Provide infrequent, deep watering and avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically requires minimal to no fertilization. If desired, a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
