## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caribbean islands (including Jamaica, Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico), Central America, and northern South America (e.g., Venezuela, Colombia). |
| **Climate** | Tropical Seasonal Forest (ranging from dry to moist forest conditions) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in good light exposure found in forest edges, clearings, or disturbed areas rather than deep understory. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, allowing the topsoil to dry out slightly between waterings, mimicking the wet and dry seasons of its native habitat. Avoid waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
To care for the Screwtree, provide ample sunlight, from full sun to partial shade, and water regularly, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize moderately during the growing season to support its vigorous growth in tropical conditions.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, benefiting from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during its active growing season (e.g., monthly to bi-monthly) due to the generally rich but varied soils of its native forest environments.
