## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Alaskan Phlox variety thrives in full sun and well-drained, rocky soil, mirroring its native alpine tundra habitat. It requires moderate watering, particularly during its active growth period, but is highly intolerant of standing water. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum, as it is adapted to lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; it is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky alpine soils and can be sensitive to over-fertilization.
