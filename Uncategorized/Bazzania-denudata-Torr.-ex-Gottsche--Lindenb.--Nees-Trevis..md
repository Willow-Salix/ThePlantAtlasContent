## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (e.g., Appalachian Mountains, eastern United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest Understory |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light; prefers deep shade or consistently indirect, filtered light. Avoid any direct sun exposure. |
| **Watering** | High and consistent humidity with continuously moist, but not waterlogged, substrate. Frequent misting or placement in terrariums/paludariums is beneficial to maintain surface moisture. |

## Introduction
Bazzania is a genus of liverwort in the family Lepidoziaceae. The name Bazzania is in honour of Matteo Bazzani (1674–1749), an Italian botanist and professor of Anatomy from the University of Bologna.

## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in consistently cool, moist, and deeply shaded environments, mimicking its native temperate forest understory. Ensure high humidity and never allow the substrate to dry out, while providing very low, indirect light. Fertilization is generally not required and should be minimal if applied.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. If fertilized, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly (e.g., once or twice a year at 1/10th strength).
