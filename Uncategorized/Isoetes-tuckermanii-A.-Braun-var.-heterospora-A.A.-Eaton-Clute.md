## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (Northeastern United States and Southeastern Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Freshwater Aquatic (lakes, ponds, and slow streams) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. It thrives in clear shallow water where it receives good illumination. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant submersion in cool, clear, fresh water or extremely consistently saturated soil conditions, mimicking its natural aquatic habitat. |

## Introduction
Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of lycopod. It is the only living genus in the family Isoetaceae and order Isoetales. As of 2016, there were about 200 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution mostly in aquatic habitats but with the individual species often scarce to rare. Species virtually identical to modern quillworts have existed since the Jurassic epoch, though the timing of the origin of modern Isoetes is subject to considerable uncertainty.
The name of the genus may also be spelled Isoëtes. The diaeresis (two dots over the e) indicates that the o and the e are to be pronounced in two distinct syllables. Including this in print is optional; either spelling (Isoetes or Isoëtes) is correct.

## Care Guide
This aquatic plant requires constant submersion in cool, clear freshwater with bright indirect to partial sun exposure. Avoid high nutrient levels, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Maintain stable water conditions suitable for aquatic life.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient requirements. It naturally grows in oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) waters; over-fertilization can be detrimental. If needed in an aquatic setup, use very dilute aquatic plant fertilizer sparingly.
