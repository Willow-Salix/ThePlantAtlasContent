## Care Guide
Arizona barley is a resilient grass native to the arid and semi-arid grasslands of the Southwestern US and Northwestern Mexico. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, preferring infrequent yet thorough watering that allows the soil to dry completely between sessions. Its fertilizer needs are low to moderate.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially if grown in very poor soils, would suffice.
