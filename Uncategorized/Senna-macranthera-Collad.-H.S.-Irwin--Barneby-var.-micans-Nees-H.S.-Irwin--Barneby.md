## Care Guide
This Senna thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, adapting to distinct wet and dry seasons. Water moderately during warm months and reduce significantly in cooler periods to encourage healthy growth and flowering. Fertilize lightly in spring and mid-summer to support its vigor in naturally leaner soils.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once or twice during the growing season. Native Cerrado soils are typically nutrient-poor, so over-fertilization should be avoided.
