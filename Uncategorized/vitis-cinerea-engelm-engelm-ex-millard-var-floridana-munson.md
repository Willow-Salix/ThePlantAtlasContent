# Florida Grape
### *Vitis cinerea (Engelm.) Engelm. ex Millard var. floridana Munson*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States, specifically Florida and adjacent states like Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical, characterized by warm to hot, humid summers and mild winters, with regular rainfall. Often found in woodland edges, hammocks, and along riverbanks. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth and fruit production, tolerating some partial shade, especially in the hottest afternoon sun, which mimics its native environment at woodland edges. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular watering, especially when establishing, to maintain consistently moist but well-draining soil. Once established, it tolerates some drought, reflecting its adaptation to periods between rainfall in its native humid subtropical climate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Vitis (grapevine) is a genus of 81 accepted species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae.  The genus consists of species predominantly from the Northern Hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture.
Most cultivated Vitis varieties are wind-pollinated with hermaphroditic flowers containing both male and female reproductive structures, while wild species are dioecious. These flowers are grouped in bunches called inflorescences. In many species, such as Vitis vinifera, each successfully pollinated flower becomes a grape berry with the inflorescence turning into a cluster of grapes. While the flowers of the grapevines are usually very small, the berries are often large and brightly colored with sweet flavors that attract birds and other animals to disperse the seeds contained within the berries.
Grapevines usually only produce fruit on shoots that came from buds that were developed during the previous growing season. In viticulture, this is one of the principles behind pruning the previous year's growth (or "One year old wood") that includes shoots that have turned hard and woody during the winter (after harvest in commercial viticulture). These vines will be pruned either into a cane which will support 8 to 15 buds or to a smaller spur which holds 2 to 3 buds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Florida Grape thrives in full sun and requires consistent moisture in well-draining soil, reflecting its humid subtropical native climate. Moderate fertilization helps support its vigorous vine growth and fruit production, adapting well to a variety of garden settings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization, particularly a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and before fruiting, to support vigorous vine growth and fruit development, in line with its growth in naturally fertile areas.
