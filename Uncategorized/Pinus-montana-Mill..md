## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Southern Europe (Pyrenees, Alps, Carpathians, Balkan Peninsula) |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine zones (Montane Coniferous Forest/Alpine Tundra ecotone) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its open, high-altitude native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering when young, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Established plants are drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering in well-draining soil. |

## Introduction
Pinus mugo, known as dwarf mountain pine, mountain pine,  scrub mountain pine, Swiss mountain pine, bog pine, creeping pine, or mugo pine, is a species of conifer, native to high elevation habitats from southwestern to Central Europe and Southeast Europe.

## Care Guide
The Mugo Pine thrives in full sun and well-draining, even rocky, soil, mirroring its native mountainous environment. It requires moderate watering initially, becoming highly drought-tolerant once established, and generally prefers lean soil conditions rather than heavy fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils; excessive fertilization can harm it. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring if soil is very poor.
