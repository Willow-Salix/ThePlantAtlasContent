The Stanford orange lichen is a hardy, rock-dwelling species adapted to the bright, dry conditions of Western North America's Mediterranean climate. Provide full sun and ensure excellent air circulation. It requires no traditional watering or fertilization, relying on atmospheric moisture and nutrients from its substrate.
