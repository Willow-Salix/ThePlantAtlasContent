## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Cosmopolitan, found globally across continents (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia), but particularly diverse and abundant in temperate, boreal, and arctic regions. Typically grows on rocks, soil, and tree bark. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate, Boreal, and Arctic Climates, including montane and alpine zones. Characterized by cold winters, moderate summers, and consistent moisture from precipitation, fog, or dew. |
| **☀️ Light** | Moderate to high indirect light or partial shade. While some species can tolerate full sun in cooler, high-altitude or high-latitude environments, protection from intense, prolonged direct sun is generally preferred. |
| **💧 Water** | Frequent exposure to high humidity, dew, and regular rainfall, with intermittent drying periods. They absorb water directly from the atmosphere and substrate surface, requiring consistent environmental moisture rather than root watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lecidea lichens thrive in cool to temperate conditions with clean air and consistent environmental moisture, such as regular misting or high humidity. They prefer moderate indirect light and should never be fertilized, as they obtain nutrients naturally from their environment and are sensitive to chemical inputs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed. Lichens are highly sensitive to artificial nutrients and pollutants, obtaining all necessary elements from air, rain, and the substrate they colonize.
