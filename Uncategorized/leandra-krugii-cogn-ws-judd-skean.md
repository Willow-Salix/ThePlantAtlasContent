| **🌍 Origin** | Hispaniola (Dominican Republic, Haiti) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Montane Wet Forest / Cloud Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial shade; avoid direct, harsh sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, ensuring excellent drainage. High ambient humidity is crucial, mimicking frequent rainfall and mist. |

## 🌱 Overview
Miconia is a genus of flowering plants in the glory bush family, Melastomataceae, native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Americas. The species are mostly shrubs and small to medium-sized trees up to 15 m tall. The generic name honours Catalan physician and botanist Francesc Micó. Some species are known by the common name johnnyberry.
Many species are threatened by habitat destruction in their native range, and some are feared to be on the brink of extinction. On the other hand, M. calvescens is a contributing factor in the decline and maybe even extinction of other plants: it has become a highly invasive weed on a number of Pacific Islands where it was introduced, including Hawaii and Tahiti. It is often referred to as the "purple plague" or the "green cancer" in reference to its habit of overgrowing native ecosystems, and its leaves which are bright green above and bright purple below.
Miconia fruit are a favorite food of many birds (invasive M. calvescens spreads by this route). The leaves of some species are eaten by caterpillars of the moth-butterflies (Hedylidae).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in conditions that mimic its native tropical montane wet forest environment, requiring high humidity and consistent moisture. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade and ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot, supplementing with light fertilizer during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Fertilize lightly with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).
