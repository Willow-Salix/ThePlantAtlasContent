## Introduction
Matricaria chamomilla (synonym: Matricaria recutita), commonly known as chamomile (also spelled camomile), German chamomile, Hungarian chamomile (kamilla), wild chamomile, blue chamomile, or scented mayweed, is an annual plant of the composite family Asteraceae. Commonly, the name M. recutita is applied to the herbal product chamomile, although other species are also used as chamomile. The plant is commonly used to make a tea.
M. chamomilla, historically used in various ancient cultures and commonly promoted today for a range of conditions, shows limited reliable evidence for effectiveness, may have mild side effects or drug interactions, and should be used with caution—especially around allergies, estrogen-sensitive conditions, and during pregnancy.

## Care Guide
German Chamomile thrives in full sun and well-draining, average soil, characteristic of its native temperate and Mediterranean open environments. It requires moderate, consistent watering, especially during dry spells, and benefits from minimal fertilization to encourage abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Thrives in average, not overly rich soil. Excessive fertilization can reduce flower production or quality.
