## Care Guide
Iranian Knapweed prefers full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native semi-arid steppe climate. It is very drought-tolerant, needing minimal watering once established, and has low fertilizer requirements, making it a low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low. Generally not a heavy feeder; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient or not needed in average soils.
