## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico, Central America, Southern United States, Northern South America |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Dry Forests, Scrublands, and Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers high light exposure, especially when actively growing. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. Increase frequency during active growth and reduce significantly during dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Acaciella is a Neotropical genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae, and its subfamily Mimosoideae. Its centre of diversity is along the Mexican Pacific coast. They are unarmed, have no extrafloral nectaries and the polyads of their pollen are 8-celled. Though its numerous free stamens (sometimes >300) is typical of Acacia s.l., it has several characteristics in common with genus Piptadenia (tribe Mimoseae). Its pollen and free amino acids resemble that of Senegalia. Molecular studies place it sister to a monophyletic clade comprising elements of genus Acacia, and the tribe Ingeae. A nectary ring is present between the stamens and ovary, in common with Acacia subg. Aculeiferum.

## Care Guide
Acaciella prefers conditions similar to its native dry tropical and subtropical habitats, requiring abundant sunlight and moderate watering, with soil drying out between sessions. Due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities, only light fertilization is needed during its active growth phases.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, general-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season. As a member of Fabaceae, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive fertilization is unnecessary and can be detrimental.
