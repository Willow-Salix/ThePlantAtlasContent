# Thyrea Demangeonii
### *Thyrea demangeonii (Moug. & Mont.) Fink*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widely distributed in temperate and Mediterranean regions, including parts of Europe (e.g., France, Italy) and North America, typically on calcareous rocks. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate and Mediterranean climate zones, characterized by distinct seasons, moderate rainfall, and often found in exposed or semi-exposed rocky habitats. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers bright, indirect light to partial sun exposure. Can tolerate direct sun in cooler, humid conditions, but requires protection from intense, prolonged direct sunlight to prevent desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies on atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, and humidity) for hydration. It is highly tolerant of dry periods, rehydrating quickly when moisture becomes available. Traditional watering is not required; avoid prolonged wetness. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives on calcareous rock surfaces in temperate and Mediterranean climates. Provide bright, indirect to partial sun and allow it to experience natural wet/dry cycles from environmental moisture. No traditional watering or fertilization is needed, but ensure good air circulation to prevent mold.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require supplemental fertilizer. It obtains all necessary nutrients from the environment through airborne particles, rainfall, and the minerals present in its calcareous substrate.
