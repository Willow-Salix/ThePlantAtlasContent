## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Texas and Oklahoma, United States |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Semi-Arid Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats in prairies and savannas. |
| **Watering** | Very low frequency, highly drought-tolerant. Water only deeply when the soil is completely dry, mimicking infrequent rainfall patterns in its native environment. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
Plantainleaf Buckwheat thrives in full sun conditions and requires very little water, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or dry gardens. Ensure well-draining soil and avoid overwatering or excessive fertilization to mimic its native arid scrubland environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to poor, rocky, or sandy soils and does not require rich nutrients or frequent fertilization.
