## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tidestrom's Lupine thrives in full sun with exceptionally well-draining, sandy soil, reflecting its native coastal dune environment. Water infrequently once established, as it is highly drought-tolerant, and avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers due to its natural nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed due to its nitrogen-fixing ability as a legume. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers, which can be detrimental.
