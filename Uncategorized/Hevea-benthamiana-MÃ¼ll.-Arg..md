## Introduction
Hevea is a genus of flowering plants in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, with about ten members. It is also one of many names used commercially for the wood of the most economically important rubber tree, H. brasiliensis. The genus is native to tropical South America but is widely cultivated in other tropical countries and naturalized in several of them. It was first described in 1775.

## Care Guide
Bentham's Hevea thrives in an environment that replicates its native tropical rainforest. Provide bright, indirect light, maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, and ensure high humidity. Fertilize moderately during active growth to support its vigorous development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer) to support robust growth.
