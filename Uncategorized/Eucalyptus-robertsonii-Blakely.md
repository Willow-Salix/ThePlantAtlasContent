## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia (New South Wales and Victoria) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodlands and Open Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, reflecting its open forest habitat. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering when young to establish, then moderate watering once established, tolerating short dry periods but preferring consistent moisture in well-drained soil, mimicking its native rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## Care Guide
Provide full sun and well-drained soil, typical of its native open forest environment. Water regularly when young, reducing frequency once established, and fertilize sparingly with a low-phosphorus product.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is needed; use a low-phosphorus native plant fertilizer if growth seems stunted, as Australian soils are often nutrient-poor.
