## Introduction
Haploesthes is a North American genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It grows in Mexico and in the southwestern United States. They are perennial herbs or subshrubs with yellow flower heads.
The name is sometimes spelled Haploësthes, with a diaeresis over the first e to indicate that the o and the e are to be pronounced in separate syllables. This is optional; either spelling is equally acceptable.

## Care Guide
False broomweed is a hardy desert plant requiring minimal intervention. It flourishes in full sun and tolerates extended periods of drought, needing very little water. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it is adapted to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Its native soils are typically nutrient-poor, so it thrives without rich amendments.
