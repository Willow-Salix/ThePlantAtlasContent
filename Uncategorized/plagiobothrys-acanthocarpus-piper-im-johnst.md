## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and requires a distinct wet-dry cycle, mimicking its native vernal pool habitat. Keep it consistently moist during its cool-season growing period, then allow it to dry out completely as it goes dormant in the warm, dry season. Minimal fertilizer is generally sufficient.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; native soils are not typically rich. A light, balanced fertilizer may be applied sparingly during the active growing season if needed.
