## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun, mimicking its native open habitats in California. It requires moderate water during its active growing season in cooler months, followed by significantly reduced watering during dry, hot summers as it goes dormant. Minimal fertilization is typically needed, as it is adapted to less fertile soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally does not require heavy fertilization. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none if grown in naturally fertile soil, is sufficient.
