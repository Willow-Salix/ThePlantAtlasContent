## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal and circumpolar regions, particularly alpine and arctic areas of North America, Europe, and Asia, including mountainous regions globally. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. This plant is accustomed to open, exposed environments above the treeline or in vast tundras, where it receives direct and unfiltered sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low. It thrives in well-drained soils, often receiving moisture from snowmelt or natural precipitation. It tolerates dry periods once established but should be watered when the topsoil dries out. |

## Care Guide
Spiked Oatgrass is a resilient alpine plant that prefers full sun and well-drained, lean soils. It requires moderate watering, tolerating drought once established, and has very low nutrient demands, reflecting its adaptation to harsh, exposed environments.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils characteristic of its native alpine and arctic environments. Supplemental fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
