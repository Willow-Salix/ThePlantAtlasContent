## 🧤 Care Instructions
The California Scrub Oak is a resilient, drought-tolerant plant well-suited for full sun exposures, reflecting its native arid scrubland and chaparral origins. Once established, it requires very little water and typically no fertilizer, making it an excellent low-maintenance choice for dry landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Generally thrives in poor to average soils without supplemental fertilization. If growth is poor, a very light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring might be considered, but often unnecessary.
