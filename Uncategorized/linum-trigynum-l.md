## 🌱 Overview
Linum (flax) is a genus of approximately 200 species in the flowering plant family Linaceae. They are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the world. The genus includes the common flax (L. usitatissimum), the bast fibre of which is used to produce linen and the seeds to produce linseed oil.

The flowers of most species are blue or yellow, rarely red, white, or pink, and some are heterostylous. There is an average of 6 to 10 seeds per boll.
Linum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the cabbage moth, the nutmeg, the setaceous Hebrew character and Coleophora striolatella, which feeds exclusively on Linum narbonense.

This resilient plant thrives in full sun and prefers dry to moderately moist conditions, tolerating drought once established. It is adapted to less fertile soils, requiring minimal fertilization. Its care strategy revolves around mimicking its Mediterranean grassland origins.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor or moderately rich, often calcareous soils. Fertilization is generally not critical.
