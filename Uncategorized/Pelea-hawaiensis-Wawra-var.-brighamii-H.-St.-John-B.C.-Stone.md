## Care Guide
Provide bright indirect to partial sun exposure, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, especially outside of its active growing season. Fertilize lightly during growth to support its native dry forest conditions.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season. Native dry forest soils are not typically extremely rich.
