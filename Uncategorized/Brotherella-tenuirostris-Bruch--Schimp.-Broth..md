*Brotherella tenuirostris (Bruch & Schimp.) Broth.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (Eastern United States, Eastern Canada), Europe, East Asia (e.g., Japan) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade. Thrives in deep shade, mimicking its forest floor habitat. Avoid direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Keep substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged. Requires very high humidity; ideal for terrariums or environments with frequent misting to prevent drying out. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, humid, and shaded conditions, replicating its natural temperate forest floor environment. It requires consistently moist substrate and high ambient humidity, making it well-suited for terrariums or damp, shaded garden spots. Fertilization is rarely, if ever, needed due to its low nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs; rarely requires fertilization. If desired, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied extremely sparingly, once or twice a year at most.
