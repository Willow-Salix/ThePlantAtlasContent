## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny to partly shaded locations with consistent, moderate moisture and well-drained soil, mimicking its native montane habitats. It requires minimal fertilization, benefiting most from good soil structure and occasional light feeding. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or organic matter can be applied sparingly, especially in spring, as montane soils are not excessively rich.
