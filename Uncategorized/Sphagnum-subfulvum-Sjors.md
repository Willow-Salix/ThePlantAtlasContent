## Care Guide
Sphagnum subfulvum requires consistently saturated conditions, ideally sitting in water, and thrives in bright indirect to partial sun. As a bog plant, it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and should not be fertilized. Maintain high humidity and cool to moderate temperatures for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
None. Sphagnum moss thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic conditions. Fertilization can be harmful and lead to decline.
