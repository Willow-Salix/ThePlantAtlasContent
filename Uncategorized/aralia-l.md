## 🌱 Overview
Spikenard, also called nard, nardin, and muskroot, is a class of aromatic amber-colored essential oil derived from Nardostachys jatamansi, a flowering plant in the honeysuckle family which grows in the Himalayas of Nepal, China, and India. The oil has been used over centuries as a perfume, a traditional medicine, or in religious ceremonies across a wide territory from India to Europe. Historically, the name nard has also referred to essential oils derived from other species including the closely related valerian genus, as well as Spanish lavender; these cheaper, more common plants have been used in perfume-making, and sometimes to adulterate true spikenard.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Spikenard thrives in conditions that mimic its native temperate deciduous forest understory. Provide partial to full shade, especially in the afternoon, along with consistently moist, well-draining, and organically rich soil. Fertilize annually in spring to support robust growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Rich, humusy soil is preferred; annual application of organic compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring.
