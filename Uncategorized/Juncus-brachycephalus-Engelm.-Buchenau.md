## Care Guide
The Smallhead Rush thrives in consistently moist to wet soil, often tolerating shallow standing water, characteristic of its native temperate wetland and bog habitats. It requires full to partial sun exposure and benefits from low to moderate fertilization during its active growth period to mimic its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength once a month during the growing season is sufficient.
