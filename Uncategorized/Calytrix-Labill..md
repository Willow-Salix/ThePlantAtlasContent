## Care Guide
Fringe-myrtle thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Australian heathlands. It requires minimal watering once established, tolerating drought, and is highly sensitive to high phosphorus fertilizers, necessitating a low-nutrient approach.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. If fertilizing, use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer specifically formulated for native Australian plants, applied sparingly in spring.
