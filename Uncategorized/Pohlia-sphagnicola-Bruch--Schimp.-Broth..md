## Introduction
Pohlia is a genus of mosses in the family Mniaceae, found on all continents including Antarctica. Some of its species are native to multiple continents. The center of diversity is the Northern Hemisphere.
The genus name of Pohlia is in honour of Johann Ehrenfried Pohl (1746–1800), who was a German physician and botanist. 
The genus was circumscribed by Johann Hedwig in Descriptio et Adumbratio microscopio-analytica Muscorum
Frondosorum vol.1 on page 98 in 1785-1787.

## Care Guide
Pohlia sphagnicola thrives in constantly moist, acidic environments with bright indirect to partial shade, mimicking its native bog habitats. High humidity and consistent water saturation are crucial for its survival. Avoid any fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
None required; thrives in nutrient-poor conditions.
