## Care Guide
Marsh-elder (information based on common name) thrives in full sun and consistently wet to waterlogged soil, ideally in brackish conditions. It is highly tolerant of saline environments and does not require rich soil or heavy fertilization. This hardy plant is best suited for wetland gardens or areas where soil saturation is common, mimicking its native marsh habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to saline marsh soils which can have varying nutrient levels. Over-fertilization should be avoided, especially with high-salt fertilizers.
