# Spotted Gum

*Eucalyptus maculata Hook.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Warm Temperate Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure is essential, as it thrives in open, unshaded woodlands and forests. |
| **Watering** | Prefers well-drained soil; regular watering for young trees to establish. Once mature, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal supplementary watering. |

## Introduction
Spotted gum usually refers to the Australian tree species Corymbia maculata but may also refer to other closely related species within the genus Corymbia as follows:

Corymbia citriodora (usually referred to as the lemon-scented gum)
Corymbia henryi (large-leaved spotted gum)
Corymbia maculata (spotted gum)
Corymbia mannifera (mountain spotted gum or red spotted gum)

## Care Guide
Spotted Gum thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its native open woodland habitat. Young plants need regular watering for establishment, but mature trees are very drought-tolerant. Fertilization should be minimal, as these plants are adapted to poorer soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer sparingly for young plants; established trees rarely need fertilization.
