## 🧤 Care Instructions
This delicate fern thrives in conditions replicating its native tropical rainforest understory. Provide very low, indirect light, extremely high humidity, and consistently moist soil, ensuring it never dries out. Fertilize very sparingly to avoid root damage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely light feeding. Use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/8 strength) very sparingly, only during the active growing season. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
