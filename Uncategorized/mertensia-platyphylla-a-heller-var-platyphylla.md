## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (United States, specifically Pacific Northwest and northern Rocky Mountains, including states like Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine (found in moist meadows, along streams, and open woodlands with distinct seasonal changes, including cold winters and snowmelt). |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to full sun. Thrives in full sun in cooler, higher elevations, but benefits from afternoon shade in warmer climates or during intense summer heat. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is crucial. Keep soil continuously moist, mimicking the conditions of natural snowmelt and regular precipitation in its native habitat; avoid prolonged waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Mertensia is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family Boraginaceae. They are perennial herbaceous plants with blue or sometimes white flowers that open from pink-tinged buds. Such a change in flower color is common in Boraginaceae and is caused by changes in soil pH. Mertensia is one of several plants that are commonly called "bluebell". In spite of their common name, the flowers are usually salverform (trumpet-shaped) rather than campanulate (bell-shaped).
Mertensia is native to most of North America and to a large part of Asia from western China to northeastern Russia. Its center of diversity is in the Rocky Mountains. Mertensia is mostly restricted to alpine, subalpine, and montane habitats. Notable exceptions are Mertensia maritima, a maritime plant of Arctic and subarctic coastlines, and Mertensia virginica, which is found from the Appalachian Mountains west to Minnesota, Iowa, and Missouri. Most of the species are endemic to very small areas of the Rocky Mountains.
Mertensia virginica has the largest flowers in the genus and is commonly cultivated. It is sparingly naturalized in Europe. About 12 other species are known in cultivation. The Inuit ate the rhizomes of Mertensia maritima.
Many of the species of Mertensia are hard to distinguish and some are possibly cryptic. Around 150 species names have been published in Mertensia. Most authors have recognized about 45 species, but in 2014, the authors of a molecular phylogenetic study recommended the acceptance of at least 62.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Broadleaf Bluebells require a consistently moist environment, replicating their native montane meadows and stream banks. Provide partial shade, especially in warmer regions, and ensure well-draining yet continuously damp soil. A light organic feeding in spring supports vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate needs. Benefits from rich, organic soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, particularly in nutrient-poor soils.
