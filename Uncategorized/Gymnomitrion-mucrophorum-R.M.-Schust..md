## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions, including Greenland, Arctic Canada, Alaska, and the Russian Far East. |
| **Climate** | Arctic-alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect light to partial sun. While native to exposed areas, the light intensity at high latitudes differs from warmer climates. Protect from intense, scorching direct sun, especially in non-native environments. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture during active growth, mimicking frequent snowmelt and rain events in its native habitat. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Can tolerate brief periods of dryness. |

## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine bryophyte thrives in cool, bright, indirect light with consistent moisture and excellent drainage. It has very low nutrient needs and should not be fertilized. Protect from high temperatures and intense, direct sunlight.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient requirements. Avoid fertilization as the native soil is very poor in nutrients and excess nutrients can be harmful.
