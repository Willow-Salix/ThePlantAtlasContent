## Introduction
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. Species are distributed widely – from Quebec to northern Argentina in the Americas, across northern and southern tropical Africa, in the southern Arabian Peninsula, in Myanmar and Thailand, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions characteristic of its native pine barren habitat. Provide moderate water, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and use fertilizer sparingly to mimic its natural environment.

### Fertilizer
Low; a light, balanced fertilizer applied once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor pineland soils.
