## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, typical of its Australian arid native climate. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and use fertilizer very lightly if at all. Its resilient nature makes it ideal for low-maintenance, dry garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; prefers poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, during the growing season with a balanced, slow-release formula.
