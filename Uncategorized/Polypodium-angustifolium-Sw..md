## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical Americas, including Mexico, Central America, Caribbean, South America, and southern Florida (USA). |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Subtropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. As an understory epiphyte or lithophyte, it receives filtered light through the canopy and should be protected from direct, harsh sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep substrate consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. High humidity is crucial, reflecting its rainforest habitat, so regular misting or placement near a humidifier is beneficial. |

## Introduction
Polypodium is a genus of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae, subfamily Polypodioideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). The genus is widely distributed throughout the world, with the highest species diversity in the tropics. The name is derived from Ancient Greek poly ("many") + podion ("little foot"), on account of the foot-like appearance of the rhizome and its branches. They are commonly called polypodies or rockcap ferns, but for many species unique vernacular names exist.
They are terrestrial or epiphytic ferns, with a creeping, densely hairy or scaly rhizome bearing fronds at intervals along its length. The species differ in size and general appearance and in the character of the fronds, which are evergreen, persisting for 1–2 years, pinnate or pinnatifid (rarely simple entire), and from 10 to 80 cm or more long. The sori or groups of spore-cases (sporangia) are borne on the back of the frond; they are globose and naked, not covered with a membrane (indusium).
Polypodies have some use in herbalism, but are today most important in horticulture where several species, hybrids, and their cultivars like Polypodium 'Green Wave' are commonly used as ornamental plants for shady locations. Polypodium have a bitter-sweet taste and are among the rather few ferns that are used in cooking; in this case as a spice e.g. for nougat.

## Care Guide
This tropical epiphyte thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, mimicking its rainforest origins. Ensure consistent moisture without waterlogging and provide light fertilization during the growing months to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Feed lightly with a diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., half-strength) every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring/summer). As an epiphyte, it naturally obtains nutrients from decaying organic matter, so heavy fertilization is unnecessary.
