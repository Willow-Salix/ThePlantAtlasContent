## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Southwestern United States, parts of Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | High direct sunlight; thrives on exposed, sun-drenched rocks, indicative of full sun exposure. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, thorough hydration (e.g., misting or brief soaking) followed by complete drying. Mimic sporadic rainfall and dew in arid environments; avoid prolonged wetness. |

## Introduction
Acarospora is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Acarosporaceae. Most species in the genus are crustose lichens that grow on rocks in open and arid places all over the world. They may look like a cobblestone road or cracked up old paint, and are commonly called cobblestone lichens or cracked lichens. They usually grow on rock (are "saxicolous"), but some grow on soil (terricolous) or on other lichens. Some species in the genus are fungi that live as parasites on other lichens (lichenicolous fungi). Acarospora is a widely distributed genus, with about 128 species according to a 2008 estimate.
Species in Acarospora may be shiny as if covered with a glossy varnish, or dull and powdery looking. They have a diverse range of colors, from the brilliant yellow bright cobblestone lichen, to the dark reddish-brown mountain cobblestone lichen, or they can appear tan, gray, or white, from a dusty-looking coating (pruina). They may grow in crustose forms like a warty surface (verrucose), like cracking-up old crust of paint (rimose), like a bunch of "islands" in a dry lake bed (areolate), like the flakes of cracking up paint are peeling up at the edges (sub-squamulous), or like the flakes are growing over others like scales (squamulous).

## Care Guide
To care for Cracked Lichen, provide high direct sunlight and mimic arid conditions with infrequent, thorough hydration followed by complete drying. This rock-dwelling organism does not require traditional fertilizers and is sensitive to excessive nutrient levels or prolonged moisture.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required. Lichens are sensitive to excess nutrients, deriving what they need from air and water. Avoid nutrient-rich substrates.
