## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions including northern North America (Canada, Alaska), Greenland, Northern Europe (Scandinavia), and parts of Russia. |
| **Climate** | Arctic-Alpine Tundra and Boreal Forest edges, often in cold temperate zones with calcareous substrates. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to partial shade. Prefers areas with diffuse light, but can tolerate some direct sun in cooler, moist conditions typical of high latitudes or alpine environments. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist. Requires regular watering to keep the substrate damp, but not waterlogged, mimicking the often damp conditions of its northern and alpine habitats. |

## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine moss thrives in cool, consistently moist environments with partial sun to partial shade. Mimic its native calcareous substrate and ensure high humidity, avoiding both drought and waterlogging. Fertilizer use should be minimal to none.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Mosses are not heavy feeders; if nutrients are deemed necessary, a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
