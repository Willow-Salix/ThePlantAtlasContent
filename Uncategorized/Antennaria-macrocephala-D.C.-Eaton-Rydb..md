## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Rocky Mountains region of the United States (e.g., Utah, Colorado, Wyoming) and Canada. |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Meadows/Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; requires significant light exposure, typical of open, high-altitude environments often above or near the tree line. |
| **Watering** | Low watering needs; thrives in dry to moderately dry conditions. Water infrequently and allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially once established, mimicking its native habitat's rapid drainage and low moisture. |

## Introduction
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright, open conditions reminiscent of its native alpine and subalpine habitats. Provide full sun and well-draining soil, allowing it to dry out completely between waterings. Fertilization is rarely necessary due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required; adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. If desired, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial, but over-fertilization should be avoided.
