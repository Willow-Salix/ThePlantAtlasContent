## Introduction
The genus Platanthera belongs to the subfamily Orchidoideae of the family Orchidaceae, and comprises about 150 species of orchids. The members of this genus, known as the butterfly orchids or fringed orchids, were previously included in the genus Orchis, which is a close relative (along with the genus Habenaria). They are distributed throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are terrestrial and have tubercules. The genomes of Platanthera zijinensis and Platanthera guangdongensis have been sequenced as model species to study partial and full mycoheterotrophy.

## Care Guide
This orchid thrives in consistently wet, acidic, and nutrient-poor conditions, typical of its native bog and fen habitats. Provide partial shade and ensure the soil never dries out, using highly diluted fertilizer or organic amendments sparingly to avoid nutrient burn.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Use a highly diluted, balanced fertilizer sparingly, or incorporate organic matter for slow release. Sensitive to high nutrient concentrations.
