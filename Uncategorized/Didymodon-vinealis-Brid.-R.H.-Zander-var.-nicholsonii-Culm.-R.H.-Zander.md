## Care Guide
This hardy temperate moss thrives in bright conditions, including full sun, and prefers moderate watering with periods of dryness. It has minimal nutrient requirements, making fertilization largely unnecessary. Its adaptability to exposed, often calcareous, substrates makes it relatively low-maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Very low; fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental. It derives sufficient nutrients from its substrate and the environment.
