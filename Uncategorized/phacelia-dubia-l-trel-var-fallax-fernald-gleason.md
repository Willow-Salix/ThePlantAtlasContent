## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often in open woodlands, forest margins, or disturbed sites) |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial sun to full sun, thriving with bright indirect light and some direct morning sun, particularly in its native open woodland settings. |
| **💧 Water** | Regular watering is needed to keep the soil consistently moist but well-drained, reflecting its native humid climate with frequent rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Phacelia (phacelia, scorpionweed, heliotrope) is a genus of about 200 species of annual or perennial herbaceous plants in the borage family, native to North and South America. California is particularly rich in species with over 90 recorded in the region.
The genus is traditionally placed at family rank with the waterleafs (Hydrophyllaceae) in the order Boraginales. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, recognizing that the traditional Boraginaceae and Hydrophyllaceae are paraphyletic with respect to each other, merges the latter into the former and considers the family basal in the Euasterids I clade. Other botanists continue to recognize the Hydrophyllaceae and Boraginales after analysing the secondary structure of the ITS1 genetic region rather than its sequence for these higher taxonomic levels.  This placed Phacelia within the Hydrophyllaceae. Further molecular taxonomic analysis of the Boraginales has divided the Boraginales in two and placed Phacelia among the monophyletic herbaceous Hydrophyllaceae in Boraginales II.
The genus includes both annual and perennial species. Many have been cultivated as garden and honey plants.
There are reports that glandular hairs of stems, flowers and leaves of some species of Phacelia secrete oil droplets that can cause an unpleasant skin rash (contact dermatitis) in some people, specifically from P. brachyloba, P. campanularia, P. crenulata, P. gina-glenneae, P. grandiflora, P. ixodes, P. minor, and P. pedicellata. The major contact allergen of P. crenulata has been identified as geranylhydroquinone and of P. minor as geranylgeranylhydroquinone.
The mining bee Andrena phaceliae is a specialist pollinator of this genus in the Eastern United States.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This annual thrives in partial to full sun and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, mirroring its humid subtropical woodland origins. Minimal fertilization is recommended to encourage abundant blooms rather than excessive foliage growth, aligning with its preference for average soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization or none, as it typically grows in average to somewhat poor soils; excessive nutrients can reduce flowering.
