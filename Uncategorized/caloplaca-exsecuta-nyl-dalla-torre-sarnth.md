## 🌱 Overview
Caloplaca is a lichen genus comprising a number of distinct species. Members of the genus are commonly called firedot lichen, jewel lichen. gold lichens, "orange lichens", but they are not always orange, as in the case of C. albovariegata. The distribution of this lichen genus is worldwide, extending from Antarctica to the high Arctic. It includes a portion of northern North America and the Russian High Arctic. There are about thirty species of Caloplaca in the flora of the British Isles.
A new species of Caloplaca, C. obamae, the first species to be named in honor of Barack Obama, was discovered in 2007 on Santa Rosa Island in California and published in March 2009.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Caloplaca exsecuta, an orange lichen, thrives in full sun on exposed rocks in temperate to alpine climates, absorbing moisture directly from the air. It requires no soil or traditional fertilizers, making it low-maintenance provided its light and atmospheric moisture needs are met.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rain) and the substrate, not from soil.
