## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This sedge requires consistently wet, acidic soil conditions, mimicking its native subarctic and boreal bog habitats. It tolerates full sun to partial shade, preferring cooler light. Fertilizer needs are minimal due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils, so excessive fertilization is not recommended and can be harmful.
