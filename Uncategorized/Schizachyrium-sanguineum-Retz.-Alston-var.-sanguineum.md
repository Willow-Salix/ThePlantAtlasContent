## Introduction
Schizachyrium is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words σχίζειν (schizein), meaning "to split," and ἄχυρον (achyron), meaning "chaff." It refers to either the glume or the toothed lemmas.
In the United States, members of the genus are commonly known as bluestems.

## Care Guide
Crimson bluestem thrives in full sun and well-drained, average to poor soils, mirroring its native grassland and savanna environment. It requires moderate watering, with soil allowed to dry between applications, and has low fertilizer needs. Mimicking these conditions ensures robust growth and vibrant seasonal color.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor, well-drained soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring is generally sufficient, or often not needed in fertile garden soils.
