## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern India, Sri Lanka |
| **Climate** | Tropical Monsoon Forest, Tropical Dry Evergreen Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. As a canopy tree in its native habitat, it prefers bright, direct sunlight, especially as it matures, but young plants can benefit from some afternoon shade. |
| **Watering** | Consistent and generous watering during the wet growing season (typically spring through fall), allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Significantly reduce watering during the dry/dormant season (winter), ensuring the soil does not completely desiccate. |

## Introduction
Ebony is a dense black/brown hardwood, coming from several species in the genus Diospyros, which also includes the persimmon tree. A few Diospyros species, such as macassar and mun ebony, are dense enough to sink in water. Ebony is finely textured and has a mirror finish when polished, making it valuable as an ornamental wood. It is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world.

## Care Guide
Ebony thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical monsoon climate, requiring full sun to partial shade and a distinct wet-dry watering cycle. Ensure generous watering during active growth and significantly reduce it in dormancy. Moderate fertilization during the growing season supports its robust development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a liquid fertilizer at half strength every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Fertilization should be reduced or halted during the dormant period.
