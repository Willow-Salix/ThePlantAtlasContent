## Care Guide
This plant thrives in sunny, open locations with well-drained soil, mirroring its native temperate grassland and steppe environments. It requires moderate watering but is quite drought-tolerant once established, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry gardens. Avoid excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization is sufficient. It thrives in average soils and does not require rich amendments; over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth.
