## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright light and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Hawaiian dry forest habitat. Allow the soil to dry between waterings to prevent root rot, and provide light fertilization during active growth. It is quite drought-tolerant once established.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, diluted fertilizer.
