## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Northern California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it typically grows in open fields and roadsides. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires regular watering during germination and initial growth; thereafter, water infrequently, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings, especially during hot, dry summers. Well-draining soil is crucial to prevent rot during wet winters. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Whitewhorl Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean climate. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering during dry spells. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally needs little to no supplemental fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil and thrives in poor to moderately fertile conditions. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
