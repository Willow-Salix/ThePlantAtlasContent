## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America (eastern United States and southeastern Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial sun to partial shade, thriving in dappled light conditions similar to a forest understory or edge. Can tolerate more sun with consistent moisture. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture, especially during the growing season. The native forest floor retains moisture, so water regularly to keep the soil evenly damp but not waterlogged. |

## 🌱 Overview
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in partial sun to partial shade, mimicking its native woodland environment. Ensure consistently moist, well-draining soil and amend with organic matter for best growth. Moderate fertilization with compost or a balanced slow-release product will support its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. Native forest soils are rich in organic matter; amending with compost annually is beneficial. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring.
