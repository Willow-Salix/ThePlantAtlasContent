## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic regions, including northern North America (Alaska, Canada, Greenland), northern Europe (Scandinavia, Russia), and northern Asia. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. Adapted to long daylight hours during the arctic summer and open, exposed environments. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, mimicking its native boggy or marshy tundra habitats, especially during the growing season. Good drainage is still recommended to prevent stagnation in container growing. |

## Introduction
Hierochloe is a genus of plants in the grass family known generally as sweetgrass. These are perennial rhizomatous grasses found primarily in temperate and subarctic regions of Eurasia and North America, although some species extend southwards into Australia and Latin America.
These erect green grasses are known for their sweet scent. They bear panicle inflorescences with rounded grass grain fruits.
Some authors advocate merging the two genera Hierochloe and Anthoxanthum, though others disagree.

## Care Guide
Arctic Sweetgrass demands full sun exposure and consistently moist to wet soil conditions, reflecting its native arctic tundra habitat. It is well-adapted to nutrient-poor environments, thus requiring very little to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor tundra soils; minimal fertilization, if any, is needed.
