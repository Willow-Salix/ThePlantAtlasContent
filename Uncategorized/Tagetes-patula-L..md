## Introduction
Tagetes patula, the French marigold, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, native to Mexico and Guatemala with several naturalised populations in many other countries. It is widely cultivated as an easily grown bedding plant with hundreds of cultivars, which often have bright yellow to orange flowers.
Some authorities regard Tagetes patula as a synonym of Tagetes erecta, the Mexican marigold.

## Care Guide
French marigolds flourish in full sun and well-draining soil, preferring consistent moisture during their active growth but tolerant of brief dry periods. Moderate fertilization supports abundant blooming, and ensuring good air circulation helps prevent common issues.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced all-purpose fertilizer during the growing and blooming season, especially if soil is poor; avoid over-fertilization which can reduce blooms.
