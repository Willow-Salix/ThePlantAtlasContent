## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Hammock Sedge thrives in consistently moist, organically rich soil under partial shade to filtered sun in humid subtropical conditions. Ensure it never dries out and provide light fertilization during its active growing period for best health, mimicking its native wetland and hammock environments.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring, or diluted liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season. Prefers organically rich soil.
