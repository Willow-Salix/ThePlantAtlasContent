## Care Guide
This bog moss thrives in consistently wet conditions with very high humidity, mimicking its native bog and wetland habitats. Provide low, indirect light and ensure the substrate never dries out. Fertilization is generally unnecessary or should be extremely sparse and diluted.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is required. If used, apply a very diluted, low-concentration liquid fertilizer sparingly.
