## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (including Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California) and Northern Mexico. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Arid to Semi-arid Woodlands and Scrublands (often Pinyon-Juniper woodlands). |
| **☀️ Light** | As a hemiparasitic plant growing on junipers in open, sunny environments, it is naturally exposed to full sun to bright indirect light throughout the day. |
| **💧 Water** | This plant extracts water directly from its host. In its native arid climate, hosts are drought-tolerant, meaning the mistletoe is adapted to infrequent water uptake, relying on the host's water reserves. |

## 🌱 Overview
Phoradendron is a genus of mistletoe, native to warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. The center of diversity is the Amazon rainforest. Phoradendron is the largest genus of mistletoe in the Americas, and possibly the largest genus of mistletoes in the world. Traditionally, the genus has been placed in the family Viscaceae, but recent genetic research acknowledged by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group shows this family to be correctly placed within a larger circumscription of the sandalwood family, Santalaceae.
They are woody hemi-parasitic shrubs with branches 10–80 cm (3.9–31.5 in) long, which grow on other trees. The foliage is dichotomously branching, with opposite pairs of leaves; these are fairly large, 2–5 cm (0.79–1.97 in) long, green and photosynthetic in some species (e.g. P. leucarpum), but minimal in some others (e.g. P. californicum). Although they are able to photosynthesize the plant relies on its host for some nutrients. The plant draws its mineral and water needs, and some of its energy needs, from the host tree using a haustorium which grows into the stems of the host.
The flowers are inconspicuous and incomplete, no petals and 3-4 greenish-yellow sepals, 1–3 mm (0.039–0.118 in) diameter. The fruit is a berry, white, yellow, orange, or red when mature, containing one to several seeds embedded in very sticky juice, called viscin. The flowers are unisexual, and depending on the species, the plant will be monoecious or dioecious (both male and female flowers on a single plant or male and female plants with only one sex of flowers). The seeds are dispersed when birds eat the fruit and remove the sticky seeds from their bills by wiping them on tree branches where they can germinate.
The foliage and berries of some species are toxic. Leafy mistletoes seldom kill but they cause stress reducing crop productions in fruits and nut trees.
Phoradendron plants can be distinguished from mistletoes in other genera in Viscaceae by their inflorescences, which lack leaves and come from a single branching point or apical meristem. However, it can be difficult to identify species within Phoradendron, because leaf shape and color can vary greatly even within species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This parasitic plant is adapted to full sun to bright indirect light, mirroring the exposure of its host juniper trees in arid and semi-arid regions. It derives all its water and nutrient needs directly from the host, making it independent of traditional soil care.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a parasitic plant, it obtains all necessary nutrients by tapping into the sap of its host tree. Traditional soil-based fertilization is not applicable or necessary for its care.
