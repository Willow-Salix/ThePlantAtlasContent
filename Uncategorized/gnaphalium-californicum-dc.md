## 🧤 Care Instructions
California Everlasting thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering during cooler months and very little during dry summers. Fertilization needs are low, making it a low-maintenance plant.
