## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Eastern North America (Eastern United States, Canada), parts of Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically moist, shaded microclimates within deciduous or coniferous forests, often near streams or seeps). |
| **Sunlight** | Extremely low light to deep shade; mimicking the forest floor, direct sun will scorch and kill the moss. |
| **Watering** | Maintain consistently moist substrate; never allow to dry out completely. Requires very high ambient humidity, often achieved with misting or terrarium environments. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in very low light conditions with consistently moist substrate and high humidity, replicating its native shaded, damp forest floor habitat. Avoid direct sunlight and over-fertilization, which can be harmful.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Mosses derive most necessary nutrients from water and ambient air; high nutrient levels can be detrimental.
