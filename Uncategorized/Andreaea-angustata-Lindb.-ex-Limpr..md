## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Alpine regions (e.g., Scandinavia, Siberia, Greenland, Arctic Canada, Alaska, high mountains of Europe) |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra, Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure (full sun to partial sun), adapted to exposed, treeless environments. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture and high humidity, but with excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Thrives with regular hydration from snowmelt or precipitation. |

## Introduction
Andreaea is a genus of rock mosses described by Johann Hedwig in 1801.
They are small, delicate acrocarpous mosses (meaning that the capsules are formed at the tips of vertical branches) that form dark brown or reddish cushions on wet siliceous rocks in mountainous areas. The capsule lacks the peristome teeth and operculum of other mosses, and opens by splitting along 4 vertical slits, the four valves remaining joined at the base and apex. The capsule of Andreaea has no seta, but the sporophyte (Spf in the diagram below) instead is supported by a pseudopodium (ps) derived from gametophyte tissue, as in Sphagnum and the columella is enclosed within the sporangium. The spores germinate to give thalloid protonemata.

## Care Guide
This Arctic-alpine moss thrives in cold, high-light environments with consistent humidity and excellent drainage, typically on acidic rock substrates. It is highly sensitive to heat and prefers nutrient-poor conditions, making over-fertilization detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. This moss is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky substrates and obtains necessary trace elements from its environment.
