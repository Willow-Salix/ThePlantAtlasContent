## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in consistently moist, humid conditions and requires very low light, mimicking its native temperate forest floor habitat. Avoid direct sun and provide ample humidity, watering frequently to keep the substrate damp but not waterlogged. Fertilizer is generally not needed and can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Bryophytes have minimal nutrient needs and can be harmed by excessive fertilizer. Substrate provides sufficient nutrients.
