## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in temperate to arctic-alpine regions. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra (also found in boreal and cool temperate montane areas) |
| **Sunlight** | High sun to full sun. Thrives in exposed, well-lit situations on rock surfaces. |
| **Watering** | Requires atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, mist) with periods of drying. Does not require soil watering, as it absorbs water directly from the air and surface. |

## Introduction
Buellia is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Caliciaceae. The fungi are usually part of a crustose lichen. In this case, the lichen species is given the same name as the fungus. But members may also grow as parasites on lichens (lichenicolous). The algae in the lichen (the photobiont partner) is always a member of the genus Trebouxia.
Lichens in the genus are commonly called disc lichens, or button lichens. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains almost 1000 species.
Genetic studies indicate that the genus Amandinea and Buellia may be the same, although this is not widely accepted.
The genus Buellia was described by Italian botanist Gioseppe De Notaris in 1846 and named after his friend, Esperanzo Buelli.

## Care Guide
As a saxicolous lichen, Buellia badia thrives in cool, exposed conditions with abundant light and atmospheric moisture. It obtains nutrients and water directly from its environment and rock surface, requiring no soil, traditional watering, or fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
None required. Obtains all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rainfall) and the rock substrate.
