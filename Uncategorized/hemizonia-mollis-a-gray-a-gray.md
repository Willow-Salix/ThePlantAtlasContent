## 🧤 Care Instructions
Soft Tarweed is a California native adapted to full sun and dry Mediterranean summers. It requires infrequent watering, thriving in drought-like conditions once established, particularly during its summer dormancy. Minimal fertilization is needed, ideally during its cooler active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a light, balanced fertilizer application during its active growing season (winter/spring), or generally requires little to no fertilization in good soil.
