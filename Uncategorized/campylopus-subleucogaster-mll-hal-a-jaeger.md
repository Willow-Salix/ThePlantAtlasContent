## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical montane moss thrives in environments with high humidity and consistent moisture, preferring indirect light or partial shade. Ensure a well-draining substrate to prevent waterlogging, and provide very minimal fertilization due to its low nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer requirements. If used, apply a highly diluted (1/8 to 1/10 strength) balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly, or none at all.
