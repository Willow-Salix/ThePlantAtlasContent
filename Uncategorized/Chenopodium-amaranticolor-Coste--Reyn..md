## Introduction
Chenopodium is a genus of numerous species of perennial or annual herbaceous flowering plants known as the goosefoot, which occur almost anywhere in the world. It is placed in the family Amaranthaceae in the APG II system; older classification systems, notably the widely used Cronquist system, separate it and its relatives as Chenopodiaceae, but this leaves the rest of the Amaranthaceae polyphyletic. However, among the Amaranthaceae, the genus Chenopodium is the namesake member of the subfamily Chenopodioideae.

## Care Guide
Magenta Spreen is a low-maintenance annual that flourishes in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil. It benefits from moderate fertility to support vigorous leafy growth. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, for the best yield and vibrant foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from fertile soil rich in organic matter. Apply a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer lightly throughout the growing season, particularly if harvesting leaves frequently.
