## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia (New South Wales and Queensland) |
| **Climate** | Warm Temperate to Subtropical Dry Sclerophyll Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (minimum 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open woodland canopy habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering when young, allowing soil to dry out completely between sessions. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering only during prolonged dry periods. |

## Introduction
A eucalyptus () is a plant in the genus Eucalyptus, which consists of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia and Angophora, they are commonly known as eucalypts or "gum trees". Eucalyptuses have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a "cap" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû ("well") and kaluptós ("covered"). The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a "gumnut".
Most species of eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. Many eucalypt species have adapted to wildfire, are able to resprout after fire, or have seeds that survive fire.
A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability.

## Care Guide
The Broad-leaved Ironbark thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, replicating its native dry sclerophyll woodland environment. It requires moderate watering when young but becomes very drought-tolerant with age. Fertilization needs are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to poorer native soils.

### Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor soils, mature plants rarely require fertilization. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer may be beneficial for young or stressed plants.
