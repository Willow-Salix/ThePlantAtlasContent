## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Andes Mountains of South America, spanning countries like Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and Paraguay. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to semi-arid montane scrubland, dry forests, and rocky slopes. |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun to partial sun exposure for optimal growth and flowering, mimicking its open, high-altitude native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent but thorough watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in cooler months, to prevent root rot in its drought-prone native environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cleistocactus is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family Cactaceae, native to mountainous areas - to 3,000 m (9,843 ft) - of South America (Peru, Uruguay, Bolivia and Argentina). The name comes from the Greek kleistos meaning closed because the flowers hardly open.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cleistocactus thrives in conditions mimicking its arid South American mountain home, requiring abundant sunlight and infrequent, deep watering once the soil is completely dry. A well-draining soil mix is crucial, and light fertilization during the growing season will support healthy development. Protect from frost.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient; apply a balanced cactus or succulent fertilizer diluted to half strength during the active growing season (spring and summer) every 2-4 weeks.
