## Introduction
Cordylanthus (lit. 'club-flower'), commonly known as bird's beaks, is a genus of parasitic plants in the broomrape family, Orobanchaceae. These western North American natives are sparse, weedy-looking annuals with long branching erect stems and little foliage, and many bear bird's-beak–shaped flowers. They are remarkable among the broomrapes for growing at searing temperatures in arid climates.

## Care Guide
To care for this plant, provide full sun and ensure excellent drainage, mimicking its native chaparral habitat. Water moderately during its active growth in cooler months, allowing soil to dry out, and reduce water significantly in summer. Avoid heavy fertilization to promote healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils; rich fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
