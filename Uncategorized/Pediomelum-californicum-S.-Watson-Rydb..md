## Introduction
Pediomelum is a genus of legumes known as Indian breadroots. These are glandular perennial plants with palmately-arranged leaves. They have a main erect stem with inflorescences of blue or purple flowers and produce hairy legume pods containing beanlike seeds. Some species have woody roots while others have starchy tuber-like roots which can be eaten like tuber vegetables such as potatoes or made into flour. Indian breadroots are native to North America. Many species have synonymy with genus Psoralea.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives on neglect in conditions mimicking its arid scrubland home, requiring abundant sunlight and very infrequent watering. Avoid overwatering and excessive fertilization to ensure its health.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Native soils are often poor in nutrients, so rich fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
