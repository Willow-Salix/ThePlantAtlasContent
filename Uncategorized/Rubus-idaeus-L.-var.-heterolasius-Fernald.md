| **Native Origin** | North America (specifically, northeastern US and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest / Boreal Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade (at least 6-8 hours of direct sun for optimal fruiting, but tolerates some afternoon shade in warmer climates). |
| **Watering** | Regular, consistent watering, ensuring the soil remains evenly moist but well-drained; avoid waterlogging. Watering frequency will depend on soil type and environmental conditions, often 1-2 times per week during dry periods. |

## Care Guide
Red Raspberries thrive in temperate climates, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimic their native forest edge habitat by providing regular watering, especially during dry spells, and moderate feeding with organic matter or a balanced fertilizer in early spring for optimal growth and fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding. Amend soil with compost or well-rotted manure annually in early spring. Alternatively, use a balanced slow-release fertilizer formulated for berries.
