## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bingen Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soil, mirroring its native rocky, open habitats. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering, and benefits from very low fertilizer input due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes its own nitrogen; excessive nitrogen can hinder flowering. Prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soil.
