## Care Guide
Ocellularia terebratula is a pantropical lichen that thrives in the consistently humid and shaded understory of tropical rainforests. Its care requires very high humidity and indirect light, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the atmosphere and bark substrate. Traditional watering and fertilizing methods are unsuitable for this sensitive organism.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizer; sensitive to excess nutrients and pollution, deriving sustenance from atmospheric deposition and its host substrate.
