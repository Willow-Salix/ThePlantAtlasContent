## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central Texas, United States |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid grassland/shrubland, often on limestone outcrops |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day due to its open habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is adapted to drought-prone, well-drained conditions. Overwatering should be avoided. |

## Introduction
Lesquerella is the former name of a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Recent work has shown that Lesquerella is indistinct from the genus Physaria and both genera have been united under Physaria. In addition, the former Lesquerella of the southeastern United States have been moved to the genus Paysonia since 2002. The genus Lesquerella is now no longer applied to any species and is considered defunct.
The genus is named in honor of Leo Lesquereux, 1805–1889, Swiss and American botanist.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun with excellent drainage, mimicking its native limestone outcrop habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid rich fertilizers as it is adapted to lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer; it thrives in lean, rocky, nutrient-poor soils and excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
