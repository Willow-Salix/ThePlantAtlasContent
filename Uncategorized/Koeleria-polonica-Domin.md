## Introduction
Koeleria is a common and widespread genus of plants in the grass family, found on all continents except Antarctica and on various oceanic islands. It includes species known generally as Junegrasses.
The genus was named after German botanist Georg Ludwig Koeler (1765–1807).

Species

Formerly included
hundreds of species once included in Koeleria but now considered better suited to other genera including Aeluropus, Agrostis, Colpodium, Dactylis, Erioneuron, Festuca, Graphephorum, Rostraria, Schismus, Sesleria, Trisetaria and Trisetum.

## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils, mimicking its native dry grassland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and needs minimal to no fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low; adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, typically once a year in early spring with a balanced, slow-release granular product, or often no fertilizer is needed.
