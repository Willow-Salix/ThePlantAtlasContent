## Introduction

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives with abundant sunlight and minimal water, mimicking its native arid environment. Ensure extremely well-draining soil and protect it from excessive moisture, especially during its dormant winter period, to prevent root rot. Provide full sun exposure for optimal growth and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; use a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer).
