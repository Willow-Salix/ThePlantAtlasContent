## Introduction
Verbena (), also known as vervain or (in obsolete spelling) verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

## Care Guide
Native to the sunny temperate grasslands of South America, this plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. It requires moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry out between waterings, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Provide light to moderate fertilization during its active growth periods.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer). Native grassland soils are not overly rich, so excessive feeding is not necessary.
