## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, California, New Mexico) and Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Chaparral Biome |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant once established; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering should be avoided. |

## Introduction
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## Care Guide
This Manzanita subspecies is well-suited to dry, sunny conditions, preferring full sun exposure. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, thriving in lean soils with little to no fertilization. Emphasize excellent drainage and avoid excessive moisture.

### Fertilizer
Adapted to lean, rocky soils; generally requires no fertilizer. If growth is exceptionally poor, a very light, slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer can be applied once in spring.
