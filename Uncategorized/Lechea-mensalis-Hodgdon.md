## Introduction
Lechea (pinweed) is a genus in the family Cistaceae of the order Malvales. The genus contains about 18 species referred to as "pinweeds" primarily in eastern North America. Most are low-growing herbs with narrow leaves and many small flowers that resemble pinheads.
Linnaeus named the genus Lechea for Swedish botanist Johan Leche (1704–1764), who taught in Finland and is regarded as the father of Finnish meteorology and space research, based on his documentation of the northern lights and early measurements of air temperature in collaboration with Anders Celsius.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, being highly drought-tolerant. It prefers lean soils, making fertilizer generally unnecessary. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid overwatering to mimic its native arid montane habitat.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; thrives in lean soils and generally does not require fertilization. If growth seems stunted, a very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring may be applied.
