## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pine Hyacinth thrives in conditions mimicking its native Florida pine flatwoods, requiring full sun and well-drained, sandy soil. Provide consistent moisture, particularly during dry spells, but allow soil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. This plant generally has low fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs; light fertilization in spring is sufficient, especially in naturally poor soils.
