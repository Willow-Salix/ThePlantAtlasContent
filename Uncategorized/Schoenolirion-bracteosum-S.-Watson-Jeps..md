## Care Guide
This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil in temperate woodland or meadow settings. It prefers partial to full sun, with some protection from intense afternoon heat in warmer areas, and requires consistent watering to prevent drying out, especially during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially in poor soils. Avoid over-fertilization.
