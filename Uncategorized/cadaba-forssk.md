## 🌱 Overview
Cadaba is a genus of shrubs in family Capparaceae, with about 30 species. These have simple, alternately set leaves. The zygomorphic flowers, are solitary or stand in small clusters at the end of short side branches. These flowers consist of four sepals, none or four petals with a narrow claw at base and a wider plate at the top, a tube-shaped nectar producing appendix, four or five stamens that are merged for about half their length into a so-called androgynophore, and a gynophore on top of which will develop a cylindrical capsule with one or two cavities that contain many small kindney-shaped seeds, and opens with two valves. The genus name Cadaba is derived from the Arab word "kadhab", a local name for Cadaba rotundifolia. Some species are classified as famine food in southern Ethiopia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Cadaba thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid and semi-arid scrubland environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering once the soil has dried out. Fertilization needs are low to moderate, best applied sparingly during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adaptable to poor soils, benefits from light fertilization during growing seasons, but heavy feeding is unnecessary.
