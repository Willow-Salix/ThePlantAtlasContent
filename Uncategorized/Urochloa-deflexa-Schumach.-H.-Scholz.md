## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical Africa (widespread across West, Central, East, South Tropical Africa) and the Arabian Peninsula |
| **Climate** | Tropical Savanna and Semi-Arid Grasslands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, as it originates from open grasslands and savannas without significant canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Its native climate experiences distinct wet and dry seasons, indicating drought tolerance. |

## Introduction
Urochloa,  commonly known as signalgrass, is a genus of plants in the grass family, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Eurasia, Africa, Australia, the Americas, and various islands. 
Several species of the genus Urochloa are cultivated as forage and some species of  were probably first introduced unintentionally to the Americas in the colonial period, from slave ships. Urochloa eminii was introduced to Brazil in 1952. Urochloa is the most widely used tropical grass in Central and South America, with about 40 million hectares planted in Brazil alone.

## Care Guide
To cultivate, provide abundant direct sunlight, replicating its native open habitat. Water moderately during its active growth phases, ensuring the soil dries out between applications to mimic seasonal rainfall patterns. Supplement with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season to support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced fertilizer. Native savanna soils typically offer moderate fertility, requiring nutrient replenishment for robust growth.
