## 🌱 Overview
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pygmy Saxifrage thrives in cool, bright conditions with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native alpine and arctic tundra environment. It requires minimal nutrients and protection from extreme heat or prolonged drought.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native soils are typically nutrient-poor, so excessive feeding can be detrimental.
