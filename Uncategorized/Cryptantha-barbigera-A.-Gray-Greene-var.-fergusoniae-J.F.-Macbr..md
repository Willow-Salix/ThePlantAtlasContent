| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern California, USA and Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), adapted to open, unsheltered environments. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; requires very little water. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water sparingly during active growth, and almost none during dormancy. |

## Introduction
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and dry, well-draining conditions typical of its arid scrubland native habitat. It requires minimal watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications, and has very low fertilizer requirements due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. Adapted to nutrient-poor, often serpentine soils. Fertilization is generally unnecessary or a very light, balanced application once a year in spring.
