## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | East Asia (China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan), Southeast Asia (e.g., Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand), parts of Australia and Western Pacific Islands. |
| **Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Wetland (Monsoon Climate) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, as it naturally grows in open wet grasslands, marshes, and rice fields. |
| **Watering** | High; requires consistently wet to saturated soil, mimicking its native marshy and boggy habitats. It can even tolerate shallow standing water. |

## Introduction
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## Care Guide
Spiked Beaksedge thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently wet or saturated soil, reflecting its natural wetland habitat. Ensure warm conditions and provide light fertilization during active growth to support its vigor.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate; a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
