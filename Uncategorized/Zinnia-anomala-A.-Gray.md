## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Texas, New Mexico, Arizona) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland, Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed desert and grassland environments. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and deep watering. Mimicking its drought-tolerant nature, allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering should be avoided. |

## Introduction
Zinnia is a genus of plants of the tribe Heliantheae within the family Asteraceae. Members of the genus are notable for their solitary long-stemmed 12 petal flowers that come in a variety of bright colors. The name honors 18th-century German scientist Johann Gottfried Zinn.
The genus is native to scrub and dry grassland in an area stretching from the Southwestern United States to South America, with a centre of diversity in Mexico.

## Care Guide
To care for Shortray Zinnia, provide full sun exposure and well-draining soil, essential for mimicking its arid native habitat. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Fertilization needs are minimal, thriving in lean soils without excessive nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils characteristic of its native arid environment. A light, balanced fertilizer application once or twice during the growing season is typically sufficient, or none if soil is already healthy.
