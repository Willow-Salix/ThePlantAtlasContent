## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, particularly the eastern United States (e.g., Appalachian Mountains) |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to partial shade, typically found in shaded understories or on the north side of trees, avoiding direct harsh sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and regular moisture from rainfall or misting; does not tolerate dry air or prolonged drought. Ensure good air circulation. |

## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in consistently humid and shaded environments, mimicking its native temperate forest habitat. It requires high ambient humidity and indirect light, absorbing moisture and nutrients directly from the air and rainfall, thus requiring no traditional fertilization.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required; this lichen obtains its nutrients from airborne particles, rainfall, and substances leaching from its host substrate (tree bark).
