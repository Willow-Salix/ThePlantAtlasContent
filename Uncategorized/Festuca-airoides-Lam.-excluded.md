## Introduction
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## Care Guide
Tufted Fescue thrives in temperate grasslands, requiring full sun to partial shade and moderate watering with good drought tolerance. It prefers low to moderate fertility, benefiting from a light annual feeding to maintain vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light annual application of balanced fertilizer in spring.
