## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, rocky soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing as it prefers lean conditions. It is drought-tolerant once established.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in lean, rocky soils. A light, balanced fertilizer applied once in spring is sufficient, or none if grown in naturally fertile soil.
