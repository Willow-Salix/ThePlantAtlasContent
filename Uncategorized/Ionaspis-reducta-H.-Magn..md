## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pacific Northwest of North America (e.g., British Columbia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane / Temperate Forest (Saxicolous) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect to partial direct light; tolerates periods of full sun when on exposed rock faces but benefits from some shade during intense midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires high ambient humidity and regular wetting through misting or simulated rainfall, allowing for periods of drying between moisture events. Does not tolerate prolonged wetness or submersion. |

## Introduction
Ionaspis is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Hymeneliaceae. It contains six species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), crustose lichens. The genus was originally circumscribed in 1871 by Theodor Magnus Fries. He segregated the genus from Aspicilia based on the presence of Trentepohlia rather than Trebouxia as the photobiont partner.

## Care Guide
Ionaspis reducta H. Magn. is a saxicolous lichen native to temperate montane regions. It thrives with bright indirect to partial direct light, high humidity, and regular wetting followed by dry periods. Fertilizers are not needed and can be detrimental to its health.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required. Lichens derive necessary nutrients from air, dust, and rainfall, and are sensitive to conventional fertilizers.
