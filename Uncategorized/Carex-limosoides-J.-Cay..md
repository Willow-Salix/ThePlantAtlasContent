| **Climate** | Boreal and Cool-Temperate Wetlands, Bogs, and Fens. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade; tolerates open wetland environments but can handle some dappled light. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions; often thrives in saturated or shallowly submerged environments and cannot tolerate drying out. |

## Introduction
The Cyperaceae () are a family of  graminoid (grass-like), monocotyledonous flowering plants known as sedges. The family is large; botanists have described some 5,500 known species in about 90 genera – the largest being the "true sedges" (genus Carex), with over 2,000 species.

## Care Guide
This hybrid sedge thrives in consistently wet to saturated, acidic soil conditions, mimicking its native bog and fen habitats. It prefers full sun to partial shade and requires minimal fertilization, making it ideal for wetland gardens or container water features where constant moisture is maintained.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; native bog and fen soils are typically nutrient-poor and acidic. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, slow-release formula if necessary, potentially favoring acid-loving formulations.
