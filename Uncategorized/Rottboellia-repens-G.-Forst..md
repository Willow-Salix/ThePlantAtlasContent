## Care Guide
This aquatic grass thrives in tropical wetland conditions, requiring constant moisture, often submerged, and abundant sunlight. Ensure its roots are always wet and provide moderate nutrients to support its rapid growth in its preferred warm environment.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization, especially if grown in a substrate that is not naturally rich in organic matter, to support its vigorous growth in aquatic conditions.
