## 🌱 Overview
Nolina is a genus of temperate and tropical xerophytic flowering plants belonging to the family Asparagaceae. The native distribution of the genus includes most of Mexico and the southern regions of the United States north to Nevada and Colorado. Especially in the USA, members of the genus are known as beargrass, some of which are cultivated as ornamental plants.
Nolina species grow large rosettes of many leaves, with many species forming large, erect trunks, with some species branching to contain multiple rosettes of leaves, while others are stemless. They are typically large plants, and are dioecious, with male and female flowers being produced on different plants.
The genus was named by André Michaux after the 18th century French arboriculturist Abbé C. P. Nolin. The type species is Nolina georgiana, the only species included by Michaux in the new genus he described; this is one of the stemless species, without any trunk.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Devil's Shoestring requires ample direct sunlight and minimal watering, reflecting its native semi-arid environment. Plant in well-draining soil and fertilize sparingly, ensuring the soil dries out thoroughly between waterings to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year in spring, or not at all if planted in suitable soil.
