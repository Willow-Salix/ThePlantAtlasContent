## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, North America, Asia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate, moist environments such as forest understories, disturbed ground, or stream banks. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade, avoiding direct intense sunlight which can easily dry it out. |
| **Watering** | Keep the substrate consistently moist; it should never be allowed to dry out completely, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Pohlia is a genus of mosses in the family Mniaceae, found on all continents including Antarctica. Some of its species are native to multiple continents. The center of diversity is the Northern Hemisphere.
The genus name of Pohlia is in honour of Johann Ehrenfried Pohl (1746–1800), who was a German physician and botanist. 
The genus was circumscribed by Johann Hedwig in Descriptio et Adumbratio microscopio-analytica Muscorum
Frondosorum vol.1 on page 98 in 1785-1787.

## Care Guide
Pohlia Carnea thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded conditions, mimicking its native habitat on damp ground. Maintain a constantly damp, well-draining substrate and protect it from direct sun. Fertilization is typically unnecessary as mosses have low nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
Low; mosses generally require minimal nutrients. Fertilization is rarely needed, or use a very dilute solution if growth is visibly poor.
