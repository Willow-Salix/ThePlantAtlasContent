## Introduction
Rubus is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, subfamily Rosoideae, most commonly known as brambles. Fruits of various species are known as raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, and bristleberries. It is a diverse genus, with the estimated number of Rubus species varying from 250 to over 1000, found across all continents except Antarctica.
Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles like roses; spines, bristles, and gland-tipped hairs are also common in the genus. The Rubus fruit, sometimes called a bramble fruit, is an aggregate of drupelets. The term cane fruit or cane berry applies to any Rubus species or hybrid which is commonly grown with supports such as wires or canes, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry. The stems of such plants are also referred to as canes.

## Care Guide
Ashe's Blackberry thrives in humid subtropical conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade. Ensure consistently moist, well-draining soil with regular watering, especially during fruiting season. A spring application of balanced fertilizer will support robust growth and fruit yield.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Benefits from a balanced granular fertilizer application in early spring, and possibly a lighter feeding during fruiting, especially in poorer soils.
