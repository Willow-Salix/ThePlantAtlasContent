## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun conditions, mimicking its native arid mountain slopes. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely, and prefers lean, well-draining soil. Fertilization needs are minimal.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; a very diluted, balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient, or none in lean soil.
