## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Boreal regions, including North America (Greenland, Canada, Alaska, northern USA), Europe (Scandinavia), and Asia (Siberia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic/Boreal Tundra and Subalpine regions, characterized by cool temperatures, high humidity, and often boggy or very moist conditions along streams and wet rocks. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate indirect light; thrives in partial to full shade, as it is sensitive to direct, intense sun which can lead to desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist to saturated conditions; the substrate should never dry out. High environmental humidity is crucial for its survival. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tritomaria polita thrives in cool, consistently moist, high-humidity environments with low to moderate indirect light. It requires a substrate that remains wet or periodically saturated and has very low nutrient demands, making fertilization generally unnecessary and potentially harmful.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. As a bryophyte adapted to nutrient-poor bogs and rocks, it is sensitive to high nutrient concentrations.
