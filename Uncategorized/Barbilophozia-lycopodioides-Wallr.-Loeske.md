| **Climate** | Subarctic/Alpine and Cold Temperate Forest (Boreal Forest) |
| **Sunlight** | Low light, preferring shaded conditions similar to forest understories or north-facing slopes, avoiding direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and consistently moist substrate are crucial. Requires frequent misting or a humid environment, ensuring the growing medium never dries out but is not waterlogged. |

## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in cool, humid environments with very low light, mimicking its native subarctic or boreal forest floor habitat. Maintain consistently moist conditions and high atmospheric humidity, while avoiding direct sun and heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Bryophytes are not heavy feeders; they derive necessary nutrients from organic matter and atmospheric deposition. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
