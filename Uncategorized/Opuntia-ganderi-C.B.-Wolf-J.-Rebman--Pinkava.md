## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern California (USA) and northern Baja California (Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive and flower. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, typically once every 2-4 weeks during active growth (spring/summer) and much less or not at all in winter. |

## Introduction
Opuntia, commonly called the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family Cactaceae, many known for their flavorful fruit and showy flowers. Cacti are native to the Americas, and are well adapted to arid climates; however, they are still vulnerable to alterations in precipitation and temperature driven by climate change. The plant has been introduced to Australia, southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.
Prickly pear alone is also used to refer to the fruit, but may also be used for the plant itself; in addition, other names given to the plant and its specific parts include tuna (fruit), sabra, sabbar, nopal (pads, plural nopales, from the Nahuatl word nōpalli), nostle (fruit) from the Nahuatl word nōchtli, and paddle cactus. The genus is named for the Ancient Greek city of Opus. The fruit and leaves are edible. The most common culinary species is the "Barbary fig" (Opuntia ficus-indica).
In places where they have been introduced outside their native range, some species in the genus Opuntia behave as aggressive invasive species.

## Care Guide
Gander's Cholla requires bright, direct sunlight and excellent drainage to mimic its native desert environment. Water sparingly only when the soil is completely dry to prevent root rot, and apply a very dilute fertilizer infrequently during its growing season.

### Fertilizer
Low; a diluted, balanced, or low-nitrogen cactus/succulent fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer).
