## Care Guide
Canby's Cowbane is an endangered wetland plant native to the southeastern US coastal plain. It requires full sun, consistently saturated acidic soil, and minimal fertilization to replicate its natural bog environment. Ensure its growing medium never dries out.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to low fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic bog and wetland soils. High nutrient levels can be detrimental.
