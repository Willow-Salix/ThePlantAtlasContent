## Introduction
Limonium is a genus of about 600 flowering plant species. Members are also known as sea-lavender, statice, caspia or marsh-rosemary. Despite their common names, species are not related to the lavenders or to rosemary. They are instead in Plumbaginaceae, the plumbago or leadwort family.
The generic name is from the Latin līmōnion, used by Pliny for a wild plant and is ultimately derived from the Ancient Greek leimon (λειμών, 'meadow').

## Care Guide
Algerian Sea Lavender is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean coastal habitat. It requires infrequent watering once established, tolerating drought conditions. Fertilization needs are minimal, adapting well to leaner soils.

### Fertilizer
Low. Accustomed to nutrient-poor coastal soils; fertilize lightly once a year in spring or not at all if soil is moderately fertile.
