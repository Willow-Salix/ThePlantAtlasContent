## Care Guide
Rocklettuce thrives in full sun exposure and requires well-draining soil, reflecting its native desert and semi-arid origins. It is highly drought-tolerant, necessitating infrequent watering, and has minimal fertilizer needs. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low; native soils in arid regions are often lean. Fertilize minimally, if at all, with a very dilute, balanced fertilizer during the growing season.
