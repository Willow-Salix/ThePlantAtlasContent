## Care Guide
This resilient rockcress thrives in full sun to partial sun with excellent drainage, typical of its native rocky, montane habitats. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings, and keep fertilization to a minimum.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; typically grows in lean, rocky soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring, if needed.
