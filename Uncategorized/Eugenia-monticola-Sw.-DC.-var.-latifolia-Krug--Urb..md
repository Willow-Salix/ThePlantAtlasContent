## Introduction
Eugenia is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family Myrtaceae. It has a worldwide, although highly uneven, distribution in tropical and subtropical regions. The bulk of the approximately 1,100 species occur in the New World tropics, especially in the eastern Brazil's northern Andes, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Forest (coastal forests). Other centers of diversity include New Caledonia and Madagascar. Many species in the Old World have received a new classification into the genus Syzygium.
All species are woody evergreen trees and shrubs. Several are grown as ornamental plants for their attractive glossy foliage, and a few produce edible fruit that are eaten fresh or used in jams and jellies.

## Care Guide
Thriving in a humid environment similar to its native montane forests, this plant requires consistent soil moisture and bright, indirect light. Provide moderate fertilization during its growth period to support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, balanced liquid fertilizer applied monthly during the active growing season (spring through summer), reduced or withheld in fall and winter.
