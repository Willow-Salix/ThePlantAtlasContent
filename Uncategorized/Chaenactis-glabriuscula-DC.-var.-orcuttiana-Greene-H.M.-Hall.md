## Introduction
Chaenactis is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae which are known generally as pincushions and dustymaidens.
These wildflowers are native to western North America, especially the desert southwest of the United States. They are quite variable in appearance. They are generally aster-like in appearance with many disc florets in each head. There may be only disc florets, but sometimes there are also enlarged ray florets along the edges of the corolla. They may be white to yellow or pink.

## Care Guide
Orcutt's Yellow Pincushion thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean shrubland climate. As a drought-tolerant species, it requires minimal watering once established and generally does not need fertilizer. Mimicking its natural arid, sunny conditions is key to its successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
