## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | High Andean regions of South America (e.g., Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, Argentina) |
| **Climate** | Puna Grassland / Tropical Alpine Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, high-altitude environment. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; water deeply when the top 1-2 inches of soil are dry, allowing for distinct dry periods between waterings. Highly drought tolerant once established. |

## Introduction
Stipa is a genus of about 140 species of large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and  spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to Stipa, which have since been reclassified into new genera.
Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as Stipa brachytricha, S. arundinacea, S. splendens, S. gigantea and S. pulchra are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.
It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.

## Care Guide
This high-altitude grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native Andean habitat. It requires moderate watering, allowing for dry periods between applications, and has low nutrient needs. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically does not require much fertilization as it naturally grows in lean, well-drained soils. A light, balanced granular fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient, or none if soil is healthy.
