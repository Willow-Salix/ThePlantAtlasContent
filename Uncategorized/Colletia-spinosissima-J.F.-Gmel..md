## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant shrub thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid scrubland environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to fully dry between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization to ensure robust growth. Provide excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils; a very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once a year in spring if growth seems sluggish.
