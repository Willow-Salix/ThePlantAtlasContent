## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Pacific Northwest of the United States (Oregon, Washington) and parts of California. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Meadow Climate, often found in moist meadows, wet prairies, and open woodlands within regions experiencing wet winters and dry summers. |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Shade; thrives with good light exposure but tolerates some afternoon shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Regular and consistent watering is essential to maintain moist soil, particularly during its growing season and dry periods, mimicking its native wet meadow habitat. |

## Introduction
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist soil, mimicking its native wet meadow habitat. Regular watering is crucial, especially during dry spells, while moderate fertilization can support vigorous growth. It is relatively low-maintenance once established in appropriate conditions.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilizer needs; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied annually in spring to support robust growth in average soil.
