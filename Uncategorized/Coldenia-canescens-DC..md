## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern USA, Mexico, Central America, Peru, Bolivia, Pakistan, India, Iran, Arabian Peninsula. |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Scrubland and Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, replicating its exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and deep watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between sessions; it is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to root rot if overwatered. |

## Introduction
Coldenia, named after C. Colden, is a monotypic genus of flowering plants traditionally included in the borage family, Boraginaceae sensu lato. It was assigned to the subfamily Ehretioideae, but molecular data revealed it to be more closely related to the genus Cordia, so that other authors placed in Cordioideae. Subsequently, it was placed in its own family, Coldeniaceae, within the Boraginales order, by the Boraginales Working Group.
The sole species is Coldenia procumbens.

## Care Guide
Coldenia canescens DC. thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid and semi-arid environments. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Fertilizer needs are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; a light, balanced fertilizer application once a year in spring is sufficient if grown in poor soil, but often unnecessary in typical conditions.
