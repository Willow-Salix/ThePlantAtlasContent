## Care Guide
This annual wildflower thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native California chaparral habitat. It requires minimal water once established, particularly during its summer dormancy, and generally does not need fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization; it is adapted to nutrient-poor, often serpentine soils.
