## 🌱 Overview
Veronica is the largest genus in the flowering plant family Plantaginaceae, with about 500 species. It was formerly classified in the family Scrophulariaceae. Common names include speedwell, bird's eye, and gypsyweed.
Taxonomy for this genus was changed in the early 21st century, with the genus Hebe and the related Australasian genera Derwentia, Detzneria, Chionohebe, Heliohebe, Leonohebe and Parahebe now included. Monophyly of the genus is supported by nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and cpDNA.
The taxa of the genus are herbaceous annuals or perennials, and also subshrubs, shrubs or small trees when Hebe is included. Most of the species are from the temperate Northern Hemisphere, though with some species from the Southern Hemisphere; Veronica sect. Hebe is mostly from New Zealand.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine native thrives in cool temperatures and high light exposure. Provide well-draining soil and moderate water, allowing the substrate to dry out between sessions. Avoid over-fertilization, as it prefers lean conditions typical of its mountain habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs, preferring lean, well-draining soils. A light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer once in spring if needed.
