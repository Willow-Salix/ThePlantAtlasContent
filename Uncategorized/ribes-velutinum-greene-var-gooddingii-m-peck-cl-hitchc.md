## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gooding's Gooseberry is a robust, drought-tolerant shrub that thrives in full sun and well-draining, often rocky soils. It requires infrequent watering once established and very minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to arid, nutrient-deficient mountain scrublands.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release formula in early spring only if growth appears weak.
