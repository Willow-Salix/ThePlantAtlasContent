| **🌍 Origin** | Western United States (specifically Colorado and Wyoming) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Semi-Arid Steppe |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun (requires at least 6 hours of direct sun daily for best flowering) |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, deep watering. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, mimicking its arid native environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Adobe Hills Beardtongue is a drought-tolerant perennial adapted to the dry, open conditions of the Western US semi-arid steppe. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring infrequent deep watering once established. Fertilize sparingly to promote healthy growth without encouraging weak stems.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all if planted in rich soil. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to leggy growth.
