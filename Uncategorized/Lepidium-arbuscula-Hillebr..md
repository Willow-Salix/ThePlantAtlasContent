## Introduction
Lepidium is a genus of plants in the mustard/cabbage family, Brassicaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. It includes familiar species such as garden cress, maca, and dittander. General common names include peppercress, peppergrass, pepperweed, and pepperwort.  Some species form tumbleweeds.
The genus name Lepidium is from Greek meaning 'small scale', which is thought to be derived from a folk medicine usage of the plant to treat leprosy, which cause small scales on the skin. Another meaning is related to the small scale-like fruit.

## Care Guide
This rare Hawaiian native thrives in conditions mimicking its dry montane shrubland habitat, requiring full sun to partial shade and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant, necessitating infrequent watering, and has minimal needs for fertilizer. Focus on recreating a well-drained, lean environment with adequate light.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; adapted to lean soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year during the growing season may be beneficial, but avoid over-fertilization.
