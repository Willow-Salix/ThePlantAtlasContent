## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically from British Columbia south through Washington and Oregon to central California. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Evergreen Forests and Coastal Scrubland. Characterized by moist, cool winters and drier, warmer summers, often found near streambanks and in open woodlands. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to full sun. Thrives in locations with morning sun and some afternoon shade in hotter climates, or dappled light within its native woodland setting. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to high. Requires consistent moisture, particularly during the growing season (spring and early summer). While it can tolerate some drought once established, it performs best with regular watering, mimicking its native moist habitats. |

## Care Guide
This temperate shrub thrives in partial to full sun, ideally with some afternoon shade in warmer regions, and requires consistent moisture, particularly during its active growth. Plant in fertile, well-draining soil and provide moderate fertilization in spring for optimal health. It's relatively low-maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from fertile, well-draining soil rich in organic matter. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in early spring is generally sufficient.
