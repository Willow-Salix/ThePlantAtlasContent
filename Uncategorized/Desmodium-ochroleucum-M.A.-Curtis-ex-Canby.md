## Introduction
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. Species are distributed widely – from Quebec to northern Argentina in the Americas, across northern and southern tropical Africa, in the southern Arabian Peninsula, in Myanmar and Thailand, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia.

## Care Guide
Native to the humid subtropical woodlands of the southeastern US, Cream Ticktrefoil thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires regular watering in well-draining soil, with minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen, so high-nitrogen fertilizers should be avoided. A balanced, low-nitrogen or organic compost applied sparingly is sufficient.
