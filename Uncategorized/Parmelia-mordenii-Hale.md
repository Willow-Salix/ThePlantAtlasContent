## Care Guide
Parmelia mordenii Hale, a temperate forest lichen, requires consistent high humidity and moderate light. It thrives on regular atmospheric moisture through misting or natural rainfall and must be protected from air pollution and excess nutrients.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization is needed or recommended; lichens derive nutrients from atmospheric deposition and are highly sensitive to air pollution and excess nutrient loads.
