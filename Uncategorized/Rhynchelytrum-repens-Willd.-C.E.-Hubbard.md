## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Africa (e.g., South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe) and other parts of tropical Africa. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Savanna and Subtropical Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is ideal for vigorous growth, reflecting its open grassland origins. |
| **Watering** | Water regularly during its active growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic savanna wet/dry cycles. It is highly drought-tolerant once established. |

## Introduction
Melinis is a genus of African and Arabian plants in the grass family.
The generic name is derived from the Greek meline meaning "millet".

## Care Guide
Pink Natal Grass thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, tolerating dry conditions well once established. Mimicking its native savanna environment, it requires regular watering during its active growing season, followed by drier periods. Fertilization needs are minimal.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder. A single application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, or it may not require any in reasonably fertile soils.
