## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its native wet limestone glade environment. Avoid over-fertilization, preferring a leaner, mineral-rich substrate. Ensure regular watering, especially during active growth, to maintain the necessary moisture levels.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization, if any, with a balanced, slow-release formula during the growing season. It is adapted to relatively lean, mineral-rich, often alkaline soils.
