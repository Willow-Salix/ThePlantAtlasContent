## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Europe, including Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Sicily, and Corsica. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. This biome is often referred to as Mediterranean shrublands or forests. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. In its native Mediterranean habitat, it thrives in open, exposed areas with abundant sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to dry summer conditions. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot, particularly in wetter periods. |

## Care Guide
Purple Toadflax thrives in full sun and requires well-drained soil, preferring moderate watering during its active growth but tolerating significant drought once established. It needs minimal fertilization, adapting well to the leaner soil conditions typical of its Mediterranean native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant is adapted to leaner soils common in its native region and does not require heavy fertilization. An annual light application of a balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth appears weak.
