## Introduction
The genus Platanthera belongs to the subfamily Orchidoideae of the family Orchidaceae, and comprises about 150 species of orchids. The members of this genus, known as the butterfly orchids or fringed orchids, were previously included in the genus Orchis, which is a close relative (along with the genus Habenaria). They are distributed throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are terrestrial and have tubercules. The genomes of Platanthera zijinensis and Platanthera guangdongensis have been sequenced as model species to study partial and full mycoheterotrophy.

## Care Guide
This rare terrestrial orchid thrives in consistently moist, acidic conditions and bright, indirect to partial sunlight. Mimicking its native humid subtropical wetlands, ensure the soil never dries out. Fertilize very sparingly during its growing season to support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; use a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly during active growth.
