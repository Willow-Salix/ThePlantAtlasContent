## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern California (USA), specifically coastal ranges of Sonoma, Mendocino, Lake, and Napa counties |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sun daily) |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; prefers infrequent deep watering during dry periods, especially during its first few years. Avoid summer watering once mature in native climate conditions. |

## Introduction
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## Care Guide
This manzanita thrives in a Mediterranean climate, requiring full sun and excellent drainage. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and needs minimal supplemental watering, especially in summer. Avoid excessive fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Requires little to no fertilizer. Can be sensitive to high nutrient levels; use only a very light application of a low-phosphorus fertilizer if growth is poor in extremely infertile soils.
