## 🧤 Care Instructions
This variety thrives in full to partial sun conditions, mirroring its native open subalpine and boreal habitats. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting the adequate rainfall in its native Northeastern North American range. Fertilize lightly in spring with a balanced formula, as native soils are not overly rich.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization in spring with a balanced, possibly slightly acidic formula, as native soils are typically not exceedingly rich.
