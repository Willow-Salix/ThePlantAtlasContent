## Introduction
Gentiana () is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the gentian family (Gentianaceae), the tribe Gentianeae, and the monophyletic subtribe Gentianinae. With over 300 species, it is considered a large genus. Gentians are notable for their mostly large trumpet-shaped flowers, which are often of an intense blue hue, though some are also bright yellow. The type species of the genus is Gentiana lutea.
The genus name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king who may have discovered tonic properties in gentians.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright light and consistently moist, even wet, soil conditions, typical of its native prairie and fen habitats. Provide regular watering and ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging while maintaining moisture. Fertilizer needs are modest, with a dilute feed during the growing season being sufficient.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to moderate; benefits from a balanced, dilute fertilizer during its growing season, especially in poorer soils.
