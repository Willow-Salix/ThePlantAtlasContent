## Introduction
Carduus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, and the tribe Cardueae, one of two genera considered to be true thistles, the other being Cirsium. Plants of the genus are known commonly as plumeless thistles. They are native to temperate Eurasia and North Africa, and several are known elsewhere as introduced species. This genus is noted for its disproportionately high number of noxious weeds compared to other flowering plant genera.

## Care Guide
Macoun's Thistle thrives in full sun within temperate climates with moderate rainfall. It prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil but is adaptable to some drought and generally low-fertility conditions, making it relatively low-maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; thrives in average to poor soils and typically does not require rich nutrient inputs.
