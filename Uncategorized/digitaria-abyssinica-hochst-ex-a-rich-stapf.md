Digitaria is a genus of plants in the grass family native to tropical and warm temperate regions but can occur in tropical, subtropical, and cooler temperate regions as well. Common names include crabgrass, finger-grass, and fonio. They are slender monocotyledonous annual and perennial lawn, pasture, and forage plants; some are often considered lawn pests. Digitus is the Latin word for "finger", and they are distinguished by the long, finger-like inflorescences they produce.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
African Couchgrass is a robust grass adapted to the full sun and seasonal rainfall of tropical savannas. It requires full sun and prefers regular moisture during its growing season, tolerating periods of drought. It is not particularly demanding regarding soil fertility.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a resilient grass, it can grow in poor soils but benefits from a general-purpose, low-nitrogen fertilizer during active growth, especially if soil is depleted.
