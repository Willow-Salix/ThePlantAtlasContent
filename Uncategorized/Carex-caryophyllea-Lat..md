## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Vernal Sedge is a resilient plant that thrives in temperate conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It is a low-maintenance species, generally requiring minimal fertilization. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.
