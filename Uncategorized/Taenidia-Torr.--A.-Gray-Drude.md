## Introduction
Taenidia (singular: taenidium) are circumferential thickenings of the cuticle inside a  trachea or tracheole in an insect's respiratory system.  The geometry of the Taenidiae varies across different orders of insects and even throughout the tracheae in an individual organism.  Taenidia generally take the form of either hoop or spiral thickenings of the tracheal cuticle.

## Care Guide
Taenidia is a resilient plant native to temperate regions, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering and is not demanding regarding fertilizer, making it a relatively low-maintenance option for appropriate climates.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average soil fertility. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth appears weak.
