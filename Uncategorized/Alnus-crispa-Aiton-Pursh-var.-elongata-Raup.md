| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, thriving in open areas or forest edges with ample light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during dry periods; tolerates some drought once established but prefers consistent moisture. |

## Introduction
Alnus alnobetula is a common tree widespread across much of Europe, Asia, and North America. Many sources refer to it as Alnus viridis, the green alder, but botanically this is considered an illegitimate name synonymous with Alnus alnobetula subsp. fruticosa.

## Care Guide
This boreal plant thrives in cold temperate climates, preferring full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. As a nitrogen fixer, it requires minimal fertilization, making it a relatively low-maintenance choice for suitable northern environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, primarily non-nitrogenous, or a general-purpose fertilizer only if soil is exceptionally poor, due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Organic matter can be beneficial.
