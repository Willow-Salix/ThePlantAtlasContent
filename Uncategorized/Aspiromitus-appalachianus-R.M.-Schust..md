# Appalachian Liverwort

*Aspiromitus appalachianus R.M. Schust.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Appalachian Mountains, Eastern North America (USA: e.g., North Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia; Canada: e.g., Nova Scotia) |
| **Climate** | Humid Temperate Forest (understory) |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light to deep shade; sensitive to direct sunlight. Prefers filtered, dappled light or full shade. |
| **Watering** | Consistently high humidity and constantly moist substrate are crucial. Requires frequent watering or misting to prevent drying out, but avoid waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
This Appalachian liverwort thrives in conditions mimicking its native forest floor environment: consistent moisture and high humidity with very low light. Ensure the substrate is always damp but not waterlogged, and mist frequently. Avoid direct sun and heavy fertilization, as these conditions are detrimental to its growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Bryophytes have minimal nutrient needs; use extremely diluted liquid fertilizer (if at all) very infrequently, or rely on nutrients from the substrate.
