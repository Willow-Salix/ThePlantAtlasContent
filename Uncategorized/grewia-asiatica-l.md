## 🌱 Overview
Grewia asiatica, commonly known as phalsa or falsa, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family Malvaceae. Grewia celtidifolia was initially considered a mere variety of phalsa, but is now recognized as a distinct species.
It is a shrub or small tree growing to 8 m tall. The leaves are broadly rounded, 5–18 cm long and broad, with a petiole 1–1.5 cm long. The flowers are produced in cymes of several together, the individual flowers about 2 cm diameter, yellow, with five large (12 mm) sepals and five smaller (4–5 mm) petals. The fruit is an edible drupe 5–12 mm diameter, purple to black when ripe.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Phalsa thrives in full sun conditions, requiring ample direct light. It needs regular watering during its active growth period, though it can tolerate some drought. Apply a balanced fertilizer moderately during the growing season to support fruit production.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during its active growing season (spring/summer), reflecting its growth in moderately fertile soils.
