## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Africa (including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Eswatini, Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Savanna and Subtropical Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure; thrives in direct, bright light for at least 6-8 hours daily, typical of its open savanna habitat. |
| **Watering** | Water deeply and regularly during the growing season, especially when young, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Reduce frequency significantly during dormant periods to mimic its native wet and dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Acacia, commonly known as wattles or acacias, is a genus of about 1,084 species of shrubs and trees in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the pea family Fabaceae. Initially, it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa, South America, and Australasia, but is now reserved for species mainly from Australia, with others from New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. The genus name is Neo-Latin, borrowed from Koine Greek ἀκακία (akakia), a term used in antiquity to describe a preparation extracted from Vachellia nilotica, the original type species.
Several species of Acacia have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established.

## Care Guide
The Monkey Thorn tree thrives in full sun and requires well-drained soil. Water consistently during its active growth phase, allowing periods of dryness, and significantly reduce watering during dormancy. Its nitrogen-fixing ability means only minimal fertilization is necessary.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, reducing its need for heavy fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring or during active growth can be beneficial, particularly in poor soils.
