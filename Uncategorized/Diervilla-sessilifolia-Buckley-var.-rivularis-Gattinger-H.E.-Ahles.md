## Introduction
Diervilla, or bush honeysuckle, is a genus of three species of deciduous shrubs in the family Caprifoliaceae, all indigenous to eastern North America. The genus is named after a French surgeon Dr. Marin Diereville, who introduced the plant to Europe around 1700.
The bush honeysuckles are low in height, 1–2 m (3–7 ft), of small to medium diameter, 1–2 m (3–7 ft), and develop into colonies by means of spreading underground rhizomes. Their leaves are simple, opposite and either oval or lanceolate in shape with a toothed edge. The fall color varies between yellow, orange and red. Small tubular flowers, typically pale yellow, are produced in June and July.

## Care Guide
This hardy shrub thrives in a range from full sun to partial shade, reflecting its adaptability in its native southeastern US riparian habitats. It prefers consistently moist soil but is resilient, tolerating some drought once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, making it a low-maintenance choice for gardeners.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can support robust growth.
