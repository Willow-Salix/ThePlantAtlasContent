## Introduction
Cardamine is a large genus of flowering plants in the mustard family, Brassicaceae, known as bittercresses and toothworts. It contains more than 200 species of annuals and perennials.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant requires a cool environment with consistent moisture and bright light. Ensure the soil remains constantly damp, similar to its native wet meadow habitat, and provide minimal fertilization. It is very cold hardy and adapted to high-altitude conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately rich soils; a light, balanced fertilizer once during the growing season is sufficient.
