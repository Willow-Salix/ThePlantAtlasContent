## Introduction
Helianthemum (), known as rock rose, sunrose, rushrose, or frostweed, is a genus of about 110 species of flowering plants in the family Cistaceae. They are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, especially in the Mediterranean.

## Care Guide
This plant is well-suited to full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native Mediterranean climate. It requires minimal watering once established and generally does not need regular fertilization. Focus on providing ample sunlight and avoiding overwatering.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, but a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be given in spring if the soil is exceptionally poor.
