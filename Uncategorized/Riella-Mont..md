## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Scattered freshwater habitats across North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia |
| **Climate** | Freshwater Aquatic (Temperate to Subtropical) |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to low indirect light, avoiding intense direct sunlight which can promote algal growth or overheating. |

## Introduction
Riella is a genus in the liverwort family Riellaceae, and includes about eighteen species. Plants in the genus are small and grow submerged in shallow temporary pools.  Although the genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, locating populations is often difficult.  Its occurrence is sporadic and local, and the tiny plants are ephemeral.  The ornamented spores remain viable for several years, allowing the plants to survive annual drying of their habitat.  The plants are easily grown in laboratory cultures.

## Care Guide
Riella, an aquatic liverwort, thrives when continuously submerged in clean freshwater under moderate to low, indirect light. It requires a stable aquatic environment with consistent moisture and low to moderate nutrient levels to prevent issues like algal overgrowth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate liquid fertilizer, typically dissolved in water, as bryophytes are not heavy feeders and excess nutrients can harm them or encourage algae.
