## Introduction
Vachellia is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae, commonly known as thorn trees or acacias. It belongs to the subfamily Mimosoideae. Its species were considered members of genus Acacia until 2009. Vachellia can be distinguished from other acacias by its capitate inflorescences and spinescent stipules. Before discovery of the New World, Europeans in the Mediterranean region were familiar with several species of Vachellia, which they knew as sources of medicine, and had names for them that they inherited from the Greeks and Romans.
The wide-ranging genus occurs in a variety of open, tropical to subtropical habitats, and is locally dominant. In parts of Africa, Vachellia species are shaped progressively by grazing animals of increasing size and height, such as gazelle, gerenuk, and giraffe. The genus in Africa has thus developed thorns in defence against such herbivory.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native Florida pineland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing infrequent to moderate watering. Avoid rich soils and heavy fertilization to ensure optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Minimal or no fertilization is usually required.
