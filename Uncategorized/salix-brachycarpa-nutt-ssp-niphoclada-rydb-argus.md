## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (including Alaska, Yukon, British Columbia, Alberta, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Idaho) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine Meadows |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in open, high-light conditions typical of alpine environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil; requires regular watering, especially in drier periods, due to its native habitat near streambanks and moist meadows. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine willow thrives in cold, high-elevation environments with full to partial sun exposure. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native habitat near streambanks and meadows. Minimal fertilization is typically needed, making it relatively low-maintenance once established in suitable conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil nutrients are very poor, but generally not a heavy feeder.
