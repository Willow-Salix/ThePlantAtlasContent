## Care Guide
The Sitka Starwort thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions, mimicking its native subalpine forest habitat. Provide consistently moist soil and protect it from direct sun. A light feeding during the growing season will support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. A diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season (e.g., once a month at half strength) is sufficient. Rich, organic soil is preferred over heavy fertilization.
