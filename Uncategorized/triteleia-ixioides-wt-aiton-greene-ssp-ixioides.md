## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (primarily California and Oregon, USA) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters) |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial shade, thriving in open, well-lit environments typical of its native grasslands and hillsides. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular watering during its active growth period from fall through spring, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Water must be significantly reduced or ceased entirely during its summer dormancy to prevent rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Triteleia ixioides, known as prettyface or golden star, is a monocotyledon flowering plant in the genus Triteleia. It is native to northern and central California and southwestern Oregon, where it can be found in coastal and inland coniferous forests and other habitat. It is a perennial wildflower growing from a corm. It produces one to two basal leaves up to 50 centimeters long by 1.5 wide. The inflorescence arises on an erect stem up to 80 centimeters tall. It is an umbel-like cluster of several flowers each borne on a pedicel up to 7 centimeters long. The flowers are variable in size, measuring one to nearly three centimeters in length. They are pale to bright yellow, or sometimes purple-tinged white. There are six tepals with darker midveins in shades of green, brown, or purple. The lobes are funnel-shaped and may open flat or somewhat reflexed. The six stamens form a fused tube that protrudes from the corolla; they have broad, flat filaments and whitish, yellowish, or blue anthers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Golden Brodiaea thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean climate, requiring full sun to partial shade and regular watering during its active fall-to-spring growth. It needs a dry, dormant period in summer with minimal to no water, and has low fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring may be beneficial, but over-fertilization should be avoided as it naturally grows in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils.
