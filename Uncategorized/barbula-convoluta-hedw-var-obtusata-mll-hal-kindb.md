| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including North America (e.g., Canada), Europe, and parts of Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Terrestrial (often found in shaded, moist microclimates within temperate forests, on disturbed ground, or on rocks) |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light; thrives in dappled shade or shaded environments. Direct, intense sunlight should be avoided as it can cause desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture, keeping the substrate damp but not waterlogged. High ambient humidity is beneficial for its growth and prevents drying out. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss thrives in consistently moist conditions with low to medium indirect light and high humidity, mimicking its shaded, damp native microclimates. Avoid direct sun and waterlogging, as its nutrient needs are minimal to non-existent.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low nutrient requirements; fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental to mosses. They typically thrive on nutrient-poor substrates.
