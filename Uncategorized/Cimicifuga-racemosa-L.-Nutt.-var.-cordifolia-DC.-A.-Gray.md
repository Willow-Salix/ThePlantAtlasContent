## Care Guide
This plant thrives in the cool, moist, and shady conditions of its native woodland understory. Provide consistently moist, rich, organic soil and protect it from direct afternoon sun to ensure healthy growth. Regular watering and annual amendments will support its vigor.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Benefits from rich, organic soil. Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure annually in spring, or use a balanced slow-release granular fertilizer.
