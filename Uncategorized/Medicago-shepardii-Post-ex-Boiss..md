## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Mediterranean region (e.g., Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Turkey) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Grassland |

| **Watering** | Low to Moderate; drought-tolerant once established. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during periods of dormancy or extreme heat. |

## Introduction
Medicago is a genus of flowering plants, commonly known as medick or burclover, in the legume family (Fabaceae). It contains at least 87 species and is distributed mainly around the Mediterranean Basin, and extending across temperate Eurasia and sub-Saharan Africa. The best-known member of the genus is alfalfa (M. sativa), an important forage crop, and the genus name is based on the Latin name for that plant, medica, from Greek: μηδική (πόα) Median (grass). Most members of the genus are low, creeping herbs, resembling clover, but with burs (hence the common name). However, alfalfa grows to a height of 1 meter, and tree medick (M. arborea) is a shrub. Members of the genus are known to produce bioactive compounds such as medicarpin (a flavonoid) and medicagenic acid (a triterpenoid saponin). Chromosome numbers in Medicago range from 2n = 14 to 48.
The species Medicago truncatula is a model legume due to its relatively small stature, small genome (450–500 Mbp), short generation time (about 3 months), and ability to reproduce both by outcrossing and selfing.
Comprehensive descriptions of the genus are Lesinš and Lesinš 1979 and Small and Jomphe 1989. Major collections are SARDI (Australia), USDA-GRIN (United States), ICARDA (Syria), and INRA (France).

## Care Guide
This species thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean scrubland. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and its natural nitrogen-fixing ability means minimal or no supplemental fertilizer is needed.

### Fertilizer
Low; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen and generally does not require heavy fertilization. Over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen, can be detrimental.
