## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically high elevations in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and Canada. Notable relict populations exist further east, such as in Minnesota. |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Tundra/Montane environments. Characterized by cold winters, cool summers, high light exposure, and well-drained, often rocky soils. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. In its native habitat, it often grows in exposed rocky areas, though some populations may receive partial shade on north-facing cliffs. Sufficient light is crucial. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent but thorough watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires excellent drainage, consistent with its rocky, well-drained native habitat, to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Rhodiola is a genus of perennial plants in the family Crassulaceae that resemble Sedum and other members of the family.  Like sedums, Rhodiola species are often called stonecrops.  Some authors merge Rhodiola into Sedum.
Rhodiola species grow in high-altitude and other cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere.  Plants of the World Online gives the number of accepted species as 74, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website gives it as 90, and the Flora of China gives it as about 90, with 55 in China and 16 endemic there.  Flora of North America lists only three species in the United States and Canada.

## Care Guide
This alpine succulent thrives in full to partial sun with extremely well-draining soil. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and provide minimal to no fertilizer. Mimicking its cold, rocky, high-altitude native environment is essential for successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. If fertilized, use a highly diluted, balanced succulent or general-purpose fertilizer very sparingly during the growing season, as native soils are typically nutrient-poor.
