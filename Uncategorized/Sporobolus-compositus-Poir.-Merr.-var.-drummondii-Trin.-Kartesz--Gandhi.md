## Introduction
Sporobolus is a nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. The name Sporobolus means "seed-thrower", and is derived from Ancient Greek word σπόρος (spóros), meaning "seed", and the root of βάλλειν (bállein) "to throw", referring to the dispersion of seeds. Members of the genus are usually called dropseeds or sacaton grasses. They are typical prairie and savanna plants, occurring in other types of open habitat in warmer climates. At least one species (S. caespitosus from Saint Helena) is threatened with extinction, and another (S. durus from Ascension Island) is extinct.

## Care Guide
Drummond's Dropseed is a resilient prairie grass that thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, along with minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally thrives without supplemental fertilizer in healthy soil, or with a very light application in spring if needed.
