## Care Guide
Chapmannia, a subtropical plant from sandy pine flatwoods, requires full sun and thrives in well-drained conditions. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between applications, and fertilize sparingly due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, to avoid nutrient burn or excessive vegetative growth.
