## Introduction
Condalia is a genus of spiny shrubs in the tribe Rhamneae of the buckthorn family, Rhamnaceae. It was named for Antonio Condal, an 18th century Spanish physician. Members of the genus are native to tropical and subtropical deserts and xeric shrublands in North and South America. The ranges of each species vary considerably; some are confined to only a few square miles, while others can be found on an area up to 1,000 sq mi (2,600 km2).

## Care Guide
Knifeleaf Condalia is a highly drought-tolerant shrub native to arid scrublands, thriving in full sun with minimal water. It requires infrequent watering, allowing soil to dry out completely, and benefits from little to no fertilization to mimic its natural desert habitat.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. If desired, a very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the active growing season.
