## Care Guide
Hairy Lousewort thrives in bright, cool light with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its arctic and alpine tundra origins. It requires minimal to no fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments and its hemiparasitic nature.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Native tundra soils are nutrient-poor, and this plant is adapted to sparse nutrients. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
