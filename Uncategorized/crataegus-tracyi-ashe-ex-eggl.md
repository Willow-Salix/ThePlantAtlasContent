## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tracy's hawthorn thrives in conditions mimicking its humid subtropical native habitat, requiring full sun to partial shade for optimal growth and fruiting. Provide moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and ensure well-drained, moderately fertile soil for best results.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native soils in its range are typically moderately fertile. A light application of balanced fertilizer or compost in spring is sufficient.
