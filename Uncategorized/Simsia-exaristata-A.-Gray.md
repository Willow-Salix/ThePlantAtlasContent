## Introduction
Simsia is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Heliantheae within the family Asteraceae.  It includes annuals, herbaceous perennials, and shrubs. They range from the western United States south through Central and South America to Argentina, with the center of diversity occurring in Mexico. The genus is named for British physician and botanist John Sims (1749–1831). Although some species are relatively rare, others have become common weeds that line the roadsides and fields of Mexico, often forming dense stands mixed with Tithonia and other Asteraceae. Some species are known by the common name bushsunflower.

## Care Guide
Simsia exaristata thrives in full sun conditions, replicating its native arid environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, necessitating infrequent watering with thorough drying out of the soil. Fertilization requirements are minimal, reflecting its adaptation to sparse desert nutrients.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; these plants are adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils and do not require heavy fertilization.
