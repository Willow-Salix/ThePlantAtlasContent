# Arctic Cinclidium Moss

*Cinclidium arcticum Bruch & Schimp.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Subarctic regions, including Greenland, Svalbard, northern Canada, Alaska, Siberia, and northern Europe. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra (specifically wet, boggy areas and calcareous fens) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade; avoids intense, direct sun exposure to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant moisture; the substrate should never be allowed to dry out, mimicking its native boggy or marshy habitat. |

## Care Guide
This arctic moss thrives in consistently wet, cool conditions with bright, indirect light. It requires minimal nutrients, preferring a constantly moist substrate and cooler temperatures to mimic its native tundra environment, never allowing it to dry out.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient requirements; minimal to no fertilization is needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor tundra environments.
