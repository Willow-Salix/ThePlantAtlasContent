## Care Guide
The Australian Red Cedar thrives in conditions mimicking its native subtropical rainforests. Provide full sun to partial shade, consistently moist but well-drained soil, and regular feeding during its active growth phases to ensure robust development.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season to support its vigorous growth, reflecting the nutrient-rich, rapidly cycling soils of rainforests.
