*Lopadium vulpinum (Tuck.) Zahlbr.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, California), often in old-growth forests. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect to dappled shade. It requires consistent but not intense light, protected from direct, harsh sunlight which can cause desiccation. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity and frequent moisture are crucial, primarily absorbed from rain, fog, or condensation. It does not require traditional watering; instead, focus on maintaining high ambient humidity or occasional misting. |

## Care Guide
Lopadium vulpinum is a lichen that thrives in cool, humid, and well-ventilated environments with indirect light, mimicking its native old-growth forest habitat. Avoid direct sun, traditional soil, and fertilizers; instead, focus on maintaining high ambient humidity and occasional misting to allow for moisture absorption.

### Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers. This lichen absorbs nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, rain) and the substrate it grows on. Fertilizers can be harmful.
