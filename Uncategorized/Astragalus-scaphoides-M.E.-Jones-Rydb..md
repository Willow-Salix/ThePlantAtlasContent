## Care Guide
Bitterroot Milkvetch thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils. It requires very little water once established, reflecting its drought-tolerant nature. Avoid over-fertilizing, particularly with nitrogen, as it's adapted to low-nutrient environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required, especially nitrogen, due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume and adaptation to lean, rocky soils.
