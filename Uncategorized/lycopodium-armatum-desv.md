## 🌱 Overview
Lycopodium (from Ancient Greek lykos, wolf and podion, diminutive of pous, foot) is a genus of clubmosses, also known as ground pines or creeping cedars, in the family Lycopodiaceae. Two very different circumscriptions of the genus are in use. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Lycopodium is one of nine genera in the subfamily Lycopodioideae, and has from nine to 15 species. In other classifications, the genus is equivalent to the whole of the subfamily, since it includes all of the other genera. More than 40 species are accepted.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical clubmoss thrives in high humidity and indirect light, replicating its rainforest understory environment. Maintain consistent moisture in the growing medium, ensure excellent drainage, and provide light fertilization during its growth period for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder. Apply a diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) once a month or every other month during the active growing season (spring/summer).
