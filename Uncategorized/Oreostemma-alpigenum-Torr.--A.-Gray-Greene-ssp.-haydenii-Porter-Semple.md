| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains, specifically Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), as it grows in exposed high-altitude environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Requires excellent drainage, mimicking rocky alpine soils with snowmelt moisture. |

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in conditions mimicking its high-altitude native habitat. Provide full sun exposure and moderate, consistent watering while ensuring excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilization. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky alpine soils, so over-fertilizing can be detrimental.
