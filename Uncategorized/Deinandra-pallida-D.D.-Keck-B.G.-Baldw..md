## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (southern San Joaquin Valley and adjacent foothills, primarily Kern County) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Woodland/Chaparral and Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. As an annual growing in open, often disturbed areas with high solar radiation, it requires direct, unfiltered sunlight for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Adapted to a Mediterranean climate with dry summers, it is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, primarily during its active growing phase (winter/spring) from seasonal rains. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Kern Tarweed is a sun-loving, drought-tolerant annual that thrives in conditions mimicking its native Californian habitat. It requires full sun and very little supplemental watering once established, preferring lean soils over rich ones. Avoid over-fertilizing and provide good drainage.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Native to lean, often disturbed soils, this plant generally does not require significant fertilization and can thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Excessive fertilizer may be detrimental.
