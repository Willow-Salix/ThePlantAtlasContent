## Introduction
Rinodina is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 265 species. It is hypothesized that a few saxicolous species common to dry regions of western North America, southern Europe, North Africa and central Asia may date back 240 million years to the Middle Triassic.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with dappled sunlight, mimicking its native temperate forest habitat. It requires consistent moisture from high humidity or regular misting but should not be waterlogged. Traditional fertilizers are detrimental and should be avoided.
