## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Subarctic regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Greenland), Europe (e.g., Scandinavia), and Asia (e.g., Siberia) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra or Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, reflecting its growth in treeless, exposed tundra environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry out slightly between waterings. Avoid waterlogging, as these plants are adapted to well-drained, albeit sometimes moist, cold soils. |

## Introduction
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## Care Guide
Hyperborean Pussytoes thrives in full to partial sun, typical of its native alpine and arctic tundra habitats. It prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil but is tolerant of some drought once established, requiring moderate watering. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, shallow tundra soils. If desired, use a very dilute, balanced slow-release fertilizer sparingly in spring.
