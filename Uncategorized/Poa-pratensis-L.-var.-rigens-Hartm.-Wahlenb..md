## Introduction
Poa pratensis, commonly known as Kentucky bluegrass (or blue grass), smooth meadow-grass, or common meadow-grass, is a perennial species of grass native to practically all of Europe, North Asia and the mountains of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. There is disagreement about its native status in North America, with some sources considering it native and others stating the Spanish Empire brought the seeds of Kentucky bluegrass to the New World in mixtures with other grasses. It is a common and incredibly popular lawn grass in North America with the species being spread over all of the cool, humid parts of the United States. In its native range, Poa pratensis forms a valuable pasture plant, characteristic of well-drained, fertile soil. It is also used for making lawns in parks and gardens and has established itself as a common invasive weed across cool moist temperate climates like the Pacific Northwest and the Northeastern United States. When found on native grasslands in Canada, for example, it is considered an unwelcome exotic plant, and is indicative of a disturbed and degraded landscape.

## Care Guide
This temperate grass prefers full sun exposure and consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting its native grassland habitat. It requires moderate watering to prevent drying out but can endure brief dry spells. Regular, moderate fertilization during growing seasons will support healthy, lush growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced fertilizer during active growth seasons (spring and fall) to maintain vigor, especially in cultivated settings.
