## Care Guide
This Hawaiian coastal native requires abundant sunlight and excellent drainage to thrive. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and fertilize sparingly. Ensure well-draining soil to mimic its natural sandy or rocky habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Adapted to relatively nutrient-poor coastal soils. A balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
