## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and alpine regions globally, including Scandinavia, Alaska, Himalayas, and high mountain ranges of Europe, Asia, and North America. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, Subalpine zones characterized by cold temperatures, strong winds, and freeze-thaw cycles. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright, indirect light to partial shade. In its natural habitat, it tolerates full sun due to low temperatures; however, protect from intense, hot direct sun in warmer conditions. |
| **Watering** | Requires high ambient humidity and occasional rehydration from misting or precipitation. It must be allowed to dry out completely between rehydration cycles but should not remain dry for prolonged periods. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in consistently cool, humid conditions with bright, indirect light, mimicking its native arctic and alpine environments. It absorbs moisture from the air and requires no traditional fertilization, being highly sensitive to excess nutrients. Ensure periods of dryness between rehydration to prevent fungal issues.

### Fertilizer
Does not require conventional fertilizers and is highly sensitive to excess nutrients. It obtains necessary nutrients from the air and its substrate.
