## Introduction
Fumaria (fumitory or fumewort, from Latin fumus terrae, "smoke of the earth") is a genus of about 60 species of annual flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. The genus is native to Europe, Africa and Asia, most diverse in the Mediterranean region, and introduced to North, South America and Australia. Fumaria species are sometimes used in herbal medicine. Fumaria indica contains an unusual mix of  alkaloids such as fuyuziphine and alpha-hydrastine.  Fumaria indica extracts may have anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential.

## Care Guide
This annual plant, commonly known as Martin's Fumitory, thrives in full to partial sun in temperate Mediterranean climates. It requires moderate, consistent watering during its active growth season and adapts well to average soil fertility, completing its life cycle before hot, dry summers.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a plant of disturbed ground, it can tolerate average soil fertility. A balanced, general-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly during active growth if soil is poor.
