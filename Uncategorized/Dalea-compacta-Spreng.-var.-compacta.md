## Introduction
Dalea  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as prairie clover or indigo bush. Its name honors English apothecary Samuel Dale (1659–1739). They are native to the Western hemisphere, where they are distributed from Canada to Argentina. Nearly half of the known species are endemic to Mexico. Two species of Dalea (Dalea ornata and Dalea searlsiae) have been considered for rangeland restoration.

## Care Guide
Compact prairie clover thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native grassland habitat. It is drought-tolerant once established and generally requires minimal watering and fertilization due to its ability to fix nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required; as a legume, it fixes nitrogen, improving soil. If soil is very poor, a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer could be applied sparingly.
