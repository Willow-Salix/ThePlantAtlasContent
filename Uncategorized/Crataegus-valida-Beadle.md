## 🌱 Overview
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Rockmart Hawthorn, native to the temperate forests of the Southeastern US, thrives in full sun to partial shade with moderate, consistent moisture. It prefers well-draining, potentially calcareous soils and does not require heavy fertilization. Once established, it tolerates some drought, reflecting its natural habitat in rocky upland woods.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied annually in spring, especially if soil is poor.
