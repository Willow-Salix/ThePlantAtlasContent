# Hawthorn
### *Crataegus delosii Sarg.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern United States (e.g., New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal flowering and fruiting, typical of its native habitat at forest edges or clearings. Can tolerate partial shade, but growth may be less vigorous. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate, consistent watering, especially when young or during dry spells, mimicking temperate rainfall patterns. Established plants are relatively drought-tolerant, so allow the top 2-3 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This temperate plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil with moderate, consistent moisture. Once established, it is relatively low-maintenance, requiring infrequent fertilization and tolerating periods of drought. Ensure good air circulation to prevent common hawthorn diseases.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally low to moderate. In its native habitat, nutrients are recycled from leaf litter. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer can be applied in early spring if soil fertility is low or growth is sluggish, but often not necessary for healthy, established plants.
