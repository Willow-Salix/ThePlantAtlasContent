## 🌱 Overview
Navarretia is a genus of flowering plants related to the phloxes and the gilias. This is one genus of plants, among others, which are sometimes called pincushion plants. It includes 45 species native to the Americas. In North America they range from western Canada through the western and west-central United States to northwestern Mexico, and to Ohio and Pennsylvania. In South America they range through Argentina and Chile.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun, requiring intense watering during its active growth in late winter and spring, followed by a complete dry dormancy in summer and fall. It prefers lean soils and needs minimal to no fertilizer, replicating its native vernal pool and grassland conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native to areas with lean and sometimes poor soils, rich fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful.
