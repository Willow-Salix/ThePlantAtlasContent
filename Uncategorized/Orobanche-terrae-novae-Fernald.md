## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, particularly northeastern United States and eastern Canada (including Newfoundland) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland and Forest, found in clearings, rocky slopes, and rich forest floors. |
| **Sunlight** | Indirectly influenced by host's needs; typically found in dappled sun to partial shade within its natural woodland habitats. As a parasitic plant, it does not directly photosynthesize. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture in well-drained soil, mirroring the needs of its host plant. Avoid waterlogging, which can harm both the host and the parasite. |

## Introduction
Orobanche, commonly known as broomrape, is a genus of almost 200 species of small parasitic herbaceous plants, mostly native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere. It is the type genus of the broomrape family Orobanchaceae. It is a weed on broadleaf crop plants in Australia, where some states enforce mandatory destruction and reporting, as well as prohibition of sale.

## Care Guide
This is an obligate parasitic plant that cannot be grown independently; it requires a suitable living host plant to survive and thrive. Successful cultivation involves establishing a healthy host plant (often from Asteraceae or Fabaceae families) and providing optimal growing conditions for the host, including well-drained soil and appropriate light levels. All nutrients are derived from the host, making host health paramount.

### Fertilizer
No direct fertilizer requirements for the broomrape itself, as it obtains all necessary nutrients from its host plant. Ensure the host plant is appropriately fertilized according to its specific needs.
