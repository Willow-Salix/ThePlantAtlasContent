## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Italy (Sicily, Sardinia), Mediterranean region |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Montane Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established, requiring less water during summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## Care Guide
Native to Mediterranean montane grasslands, Festuca dimorpha thrives in full to partial sun with well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering, especially during active growth, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization. This grass is relatively drought-tolerant and adapted to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, ideally a balanced slow-release formula applied in early spring. Avoid heavy feeding.
