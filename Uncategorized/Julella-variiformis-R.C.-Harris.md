## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States, extending into parts of Mexico and the Caribbean |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (specifically, shaded, humid forests, swamps, and hammocks) |
| **Sunlight** | Very low to low, indirect light. This epiphytic lichen thrives in deep shade, mimicking the understory of dense, wet forests. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity is critical. Requires consistent moisture, often from frequent misting or a highly humid environment, to replicate regular rainfall and dew. Avoid drying out completely. |

## Introduction
Julella is a genus of ascomycete fungi. Most species are non-lichenised, bark-dwelling saprophytes, though some collections appear to be facultatively lichenised with the green alga Trentepohlia. The fungi produce immersed, black, flask-shaped perithecia with a dark involucrellum. Their asci are double-walled and contain two or eight large, colourless, muriform (multi-chambered) ascospores. Asexual fruiting bodies (pycnidia) produce simple, rod-shaped conidia. No secondary metabolites are known. The genus was introduced by Jean-Henri Fabre in 1879. Modern treatments recognise only a few species, and its family placement is unsettled, with recent sources placing it in Thelenellaceae, Trypetheliaceae, or Didymosphaeriaceae.

## Care Guide
This lichen needs a consistently humid environment with very low, indirect light, mirroring its native habitat on tree bark in dense, shaded forests. It relies on high atmospheric moisture and does not require supplemental fertilization. Protection from direct sunlight and dry conditions is crucial for its health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Lichens primarily obtain nutrients from atmospheric deposition and their substrate (tree bark), rather than soil. Excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
