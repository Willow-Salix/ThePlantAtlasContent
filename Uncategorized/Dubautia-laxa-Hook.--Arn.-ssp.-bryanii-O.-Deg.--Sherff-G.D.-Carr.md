## Introduction
Dubautia or na'ena'e is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. The genus was named after Joseph Eugène DuBaut (1796–1832), an officer in the French Navy who participated in Freycinet's expedition.
The entire genus is endemic to Hawaii. It contains more species than the other two genera in the silversword alliance, including cushion plants, shrubs, trees, and lianas.
