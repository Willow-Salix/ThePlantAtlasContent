## Care Guide
The Marsh Cuckooflower thrives in consistently wet, temperate environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. It demands constantly moist to waterlogged soil, mimicking its native boggy habitats, and requires minimal fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from soils rich in organic matter but is generally not a heavy feeder. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring is usually sufficient if needed.
