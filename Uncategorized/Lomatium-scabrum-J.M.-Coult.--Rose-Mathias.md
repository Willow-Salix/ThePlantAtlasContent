## Introduction
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.

## Care Guide
Rough Desertparsley thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland habitat, demanding full sun and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering and minimal to no fertilization to maintain health.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required, as it is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor desert soils.
