## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | China (provinces including Anhui, Fujian, Henan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Zhejiang) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Monsoon Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it grows in forest clearings or edges, benefiting from ample sunlight for vigorous growth. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, reflecting the moderate to high rainfall in its native monsoon climate. Water regularly, especially during dry periods, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Phyllostachys ()
is a genus of Asian bamboo in the grass family.  Many of the species are found in central and southern China, with a few species in northern Indochina and in the Himalayas. Some of the species have become naturalized in parts of Asia, South America, Australia, and southern Europe.
The stem or culm has a prominent groove, called a sulcus, that runs along the length of each segment (or internode).  Because of this, it is one of the most easily identifiable genera of bamboo. Most of the species spread aggressively by underground rhizomes. Being pioneer plants, phyllostachys species will not spread quickly or achieve mature height without access to direct sunlight throughout most of the day.
Some species of Phyllostachys grow to 100 ft (30 m) tall in optimum conditions.  Some of the larger species, sometimes known as "timber bamboo", are used as construction timber and for making furniture. Several species are cultivated as ornamental plants, though they can become invasive and troublesome in gardens, unless artificially restricted or grown in containers.
The name Phyllostachys means "leaf spike" and refers to the inflorescences.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This vigorous bamboo thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native temperate monsoon forest conditions. Regular watering and fertilization during the growing season are essential to support its rapid growth and large stature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high nutrient needs due to its rapid growth. In its native rich forest soils, it thrives on organic matter; fertilize with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost during the growing season.
