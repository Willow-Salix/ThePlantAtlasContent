## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Subarctic and Boreal regions of Northern Asia (e.g., Siberia, Russian Far East, Japan) and North America (e.g., Alaska, Pacific Northwest, Canada) |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest / Subarctic |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Shade to Full Shade (as it grows in the understory, parasitic on host roots) |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting the damp conditions often found in boreal forests. |

## Introduction
Boschniakia is a genus of parasitic plants in the family Orobanchaceae. They are known commonly as groundcones and they are native to western North America and extreme northeastern Asia. Some taxonomists consider Boschniakia to be three separate genera: Boschniakia, Kopsiopsis, and Xylanche. When the genus is split, only a single species remains: Boschniakia rossica, the northern groundcone.
Groundcones are holoparasitic, meaning they depend entirely on a host plant for nutrients and contain little or no chlorophyll. These plants often parasitize alders but they are found on many other plants. Groundcones often look at first glance like pine cones lying on the ground, especially when they are brown in color. They may also be shades of yellow, red, and purple. Each plant may be a few inches tall, and pine-cone-shaped or cylindrical. The plant above ground is almost entirely made up of its inflorescence, a tightly packed column of thick cup-shaped flowers. The groundcone produces haustoria which penetrate the roots of its host and provide it with water and nutrients.
The type species for Boschniakia is Boschniakia glabra, a species which is no longer considered valid. Instead, it is now included in Boschniakia rossica.

## Care Guide
As a parasitic plant native to boreal and subarctic forests, Northern Groundcone requires cool, moist, and shaded conditions. Its survival is entirely dependent on a suitable host plant, from which it draws all its nutrients, making direct fertilization largely irrelevant for the parasite itself. Therefore, successful cultivation hinges on providing the correct host and maintaining consistently moist soil in a shaded environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to none directly for the plant, as it is a holoparasite that derives all its nutrients from its host plant (e.g., Alnus, Vaccinium). Focus on ensuring a healthy host.
