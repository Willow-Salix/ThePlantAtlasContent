## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Mediterranean (e.g., Israel, Jordan, Syria) and North Africa (e.g., Egypt, Libya) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed environments. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings. Mimic its native pattern of receiving moisture primarily during cooler, wetter seasons. |

## Care Guide
Goatgrass thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, typical of its native arid scrubland environment. Provide infrequent, deep watering and minimal fertilization, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings to mimic its natural conditions and prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal; this plant is adapted to less fertile soils. Excessive fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
