## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including mountainous regions from British Columbia, Canada, south to California and New Mexico, USA, and east to the Rocky Mountains. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane and Subalpine Meadows, Open Forests, and Stream Banks |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in open, well-lit areas typical of high-elevation meadows and forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Regular and consistent moisture is preferred, mimicking the moist conditions found in its native meadow and stream bank habitats, especially during the growing season. Avoid prolonged drought or waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## Care Guide
Longstalk Clover flourishes in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its natural habitat in temperate mountain meadows. Being a nitrogen-fixing plant, it has low fertilization needs, primarily benefiting from good soil organic content. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry periods, to support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally requires minimal to no nitrogen fertilizer. Providing well-drained soil rich in organic matter is usually sufficient, though a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer can be applied if growth is poor in very lean soils.
