## Care Guide
Mojave milkvetch thrives in full sun and extremely well-draining, infertile soils, mimicking its native desert environment. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering and no regular fertilization. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Very low. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen, so no supplemental fertilizer is generally needed. If growth is poor, a very dilute, low-nitrogen formula might be used sparingly.
