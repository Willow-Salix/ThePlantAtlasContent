# Phlyctidia Lichen

*Phlyctidia ludoviciensis Müll. Arg.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Brazil (Atlantic Forest) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forest (Tropical Rainforest) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to Moderate, indirect light; thrives in dappled shade conditions similar to a forest understory. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity is critical; requires consistent moisture from rain or mist, never allowing desiccation. Does not tolerate drying out. |

## Care Guide
This tropical lichen thrives in very high humidity and dappled, indirect light, mimicking its native rainforest canopy environment. It requires consistent atmospheric moisture and should never be allowed to dry out completely. Nutrient needs are minimal, relying on atmospheric absorption rather than fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs; absorbs trace nutrients from air and rain. Artificial fertilizers are generally detrimental and should be avoided.
