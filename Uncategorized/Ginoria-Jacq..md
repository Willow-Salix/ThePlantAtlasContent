| **Native Origin** | Caribbean islands (e.g., Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica) and parts of Central America (e.g., Costa Rica). |
| **Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. In its native habitat, it often grows in the understory or along forest edges where it receives filtered sunlight. |

## Care Guide
Ginoria thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical moist forest. Provide bright indirect light, keep the soil consistently moist but well-drained, and fertilize moderately during the active growing period.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced liquid fertilizer applied every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer) would mimic the nutrient cycling in its native environment.
