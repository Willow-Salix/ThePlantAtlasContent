## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (coastal plain from North Carolina to Florida and west to Louisiana) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical, specifically in wetland habitats like wet pine flatwoods, bogs, savannas, and marshes |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, as it typically grows in open or sparsely treed wetland environments. |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to saturated soil; this plant is a wetland species and requires constant moisture, never allowing the soil to dry out. |

## Introduction
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## Care Guide
This wetland plant thrives in consistently wet to saturated, acidic soils under full to partial sun. Ensure constant moisture and avoid drying out, mimicking its natural bog and wet flatwood habitats. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, often acidic soils characteristic of bogs and wet pine flatwoods.
