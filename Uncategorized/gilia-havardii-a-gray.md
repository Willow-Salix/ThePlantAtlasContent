| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and northern Mexico (Coahuila) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland (Chihuahuan Desert) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring intense direct light for most of the day, typical of open desert environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; deeply water when the soil is completely dry, mimicking sparse desert rainfall patterns. Highly drought-tolerant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Havard's Gilia thrives in conditions mimicking its native Chihuahuan Desert environment, requiring full sun and very infrequent, deep watering. It is highly drought-tolerant and prefers poor, well-draining soil with minimal nutrient input. This plant is ideal for xeriscaping or arid garden settings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements; native desert soils are typically nutrient-poor, so excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
