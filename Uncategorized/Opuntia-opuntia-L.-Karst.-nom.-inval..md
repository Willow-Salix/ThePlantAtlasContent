## Care Guide
This plant requires full sun and thrives on infrequent watering, mirroring its drought-tolerant nature. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot, as it is accustomed to drier, open environments. Fertilize sparingly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low; a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer diluted to half strength can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
