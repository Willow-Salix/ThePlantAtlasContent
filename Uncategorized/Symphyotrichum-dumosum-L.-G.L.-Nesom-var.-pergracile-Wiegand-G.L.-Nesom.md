## Introduction
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).

## Care Guide
This resilient aster thrives in temperate North American climates, preferring full sun and moderate watering. It is highly adaptable to average to poor soils, requiring minimal fertilization to produce its characteristic small white flowers, making it a low-maintenance choice.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant tolerates poor to average soils found in its native habitats and typically does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring is only necessary if growth is exceptionally poor.
