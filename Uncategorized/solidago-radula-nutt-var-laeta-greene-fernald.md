## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Western Rough Goldenrod thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established, preferring well-drained soil. It requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for sunny, drier garden spots.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant is adapted to average or poor soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all in fertile soils, is sufficient.
