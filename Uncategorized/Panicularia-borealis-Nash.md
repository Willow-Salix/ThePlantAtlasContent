## Introduction
Glyceria borealis is a species of Glyceria known by the common names northern mannagrass, boreal mannagrass, and small floating mannagrass. It is native to much of the northern half of North America, where it has a widespread distribution. This semiaquatic plant grows in wet areas in mountain forests, often in the water.
It grows a tall and very thin stem often exceeding a meter in height when erect. It may bend, lie flat on the ground, or float in the water of ponds and streams. The leaves bear ligules up to a centimeter long. The narrow, long inflorescence has cylindrical spikelets one to two centimeters long, each made up of 6 to 11 florets with membranous margins.

## Care Guide
This wetland grass thrives in consistently wet to submerged conditions under full sun to partial shade, mirroring its northern North American wetland origin. Ensure its soil never dries out, providing continuous moisture. Fertilization needs are generally low to moderate, reflecting its adaptation to natural wetland environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; it's adapted to the nutrient content of wetland soils, which can vary but often contain organic matter.
