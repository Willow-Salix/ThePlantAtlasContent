## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Kauaʻi, Hawaii, USA (Limahuli Valley) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun for optimal growth once mature; young plants can tolerate partial shade, which mimics their initial growth under a canopy. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking high rainfall in its native habitat. Water frequently, especially during warmer periods, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging and root rot. |

## Introduction
The genus Pritchardia (family Arecaceae) consists of between 24 and 40 species of fan palms (subfamily Coryphoideae) found on tropical Pacific Ocean islands in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Tuamotus, and most diversely in Hawaii. The generic name honors William Thomas Pritchard (1829–1907), a British consul at Fiji.

## Care Guide
To care for the Limahuli Valley Pritchardia, provide an environment mirroring its native tropical wet forest. This includes full sun exposure for mature plants, consistently moist (but well-drained) soil, and regular feeding with a palm-specific fertilizer to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release palm-specific fertilizer 2-3 times during the growing season (spring/summer). Look for formulas rich in magnesium and potassium.
