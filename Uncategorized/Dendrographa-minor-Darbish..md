## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., California), Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Coastal Chaparral and Scrubland, often fog-influenced) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect to partial sun. Tolerates direct morning sun but prefers protection from intense afternoon sun, especially in dry air. |
| **Watering** | As a lichen, it requires high atmospheric humidity or regular misting (1-3 times a week) to absorb moisture. Allow it to completely dry out between hydration periods. It does not 'grow' in soil and should not be watered like a vascular plant. |

## Introduction
Dendrographa is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Roccellaceae. It has seven species. These lichens form small, shrubby tufts that cling to bark or coastal rocks along the Pacific seaboard, with brown-grey main branches and paler, pencil-thin tips that lack a protective outer skin. The genus was originally established in 1895 for a single Pacific coast species, but molecular studies in the 2010s expanded it by transferring four additional species from other genera and led to the discovery of a seventh species in Brazil.

## Care Guide
Dendrographa minor, a lichen, thrives in environments mimicking its native coastal Mediterranean climate, characterized by bright light, good air circulation, and high atmospheric humidity from fog or mist. Ensure regular misting and allow for complete drying between hydration cycles, as traditional watering or fertilization is not required.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens derive all necessary nutrients directly from the air, rain, and the substrate they grow on, making traditional fertilization unnecessary and potentially harmful.
