## Introduction

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean climate, requiring full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Water regularly during its active winter/spring growth, but ensure a completely dry dormancy through the summer to prevent bulb rot. Fertilization should be minimal, if at all.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. If desired, a very light application of a low-nitrogen, balanced fertilizer can be given at the start of the growing season.
