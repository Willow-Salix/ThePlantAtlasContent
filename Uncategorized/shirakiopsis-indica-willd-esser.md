## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia (Sumatra, Borneo, Java), Thailand, Myanmar, and the Andaman Islands. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it can be found in forest clearings or at edges, suggesting tolerance for direct sun but also thriving with filtered light, especially when young. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Native to high rainfall areas, it should be watered frequently to prevent the soil from drying out, mimicking continuous tropical rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Shirakiopsis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae first described as a genus in 1999. There are six known species, 3 native to tropical Asia and 3 to tropical Africa.
These are trees and shrubs producing a milky latex. Their smaller branches are coated in pale-colored, yellowish, or sometimes reddish hairs. The toothed oblong to oval leaves are alternately arranged and there are small ovate to triangular stipules. The inflorescences are thyrses at the branch tips. The plants are monoecious; the inflorescence holds a few male flowers with usually one to three female flowers at the base. The male flower has three stamens. The female flower has 2 or 3 stigmas. There are no petals. The fruit is smooth, dry, and woody or occasionally slightly fleshy, and contains 2 or 3 seeds in each of its chambers.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Meskerekur thrives in conditions mirroring its native tropical rainforest, necessitating consistently moist, well-draining soil and a location offering full sun to partial shade. Regular fertilization during active growth will help it flourish, emulating the rapid nutrient turnover found in its natural environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season. This supports its growth in typical rainforest soils which, while rich in organic matter, have fast nutrient cycling.
