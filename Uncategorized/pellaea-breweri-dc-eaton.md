| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (specifically mountainous regions of the Western United States, including Sierra Nevada, Cascade Range, and Rocky Mountains) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine (characterized by dry, rocky slopes and crevices, often with seasonal drought and temperature variations) |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full sun, tolerating strong direct light exposure found on cliff faces, but may benefit from some afternoon shade in the hottest climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Highly drought-tolerant; prefers dry conditions and excellent drainage. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Brewer's Cliffbrake thrives in dry, rocky conditions with excellent drainage, mimicking its native cliff habitat. Provide ample light and water sparingly, allowing the soil to completely dry out between waterings. Minimal to no fertilization is required to maintain its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs; thrives in lean, rocky soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a highly diluted solution only during the active growing season.
