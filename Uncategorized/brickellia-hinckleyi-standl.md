## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona) and Northern Mexico (Chihuahua) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Chihuahuan Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, replicating its open desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant; water sparingly, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Infrequent but deep watering is best, mimicking desert rainfall patterns. |

## 🌱 Overview
Brickellia is a North American genus of about 100 to 110 species of plants in the family Asteraceae, known commonly as brickellbushes. They are found in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central America.  Many species are native to the American southwest, especially Texas. Brickellia is among the more basal lineages of the Eupatorieae and should not be assigned to a subtribe pending further research.
They are mostly woody perennial shrubs. Some species have a very strong pleasant scent, while others smell distasteful. All contain high amounts of essential oils. Germacrene D, a natural insecticide, is found in B. veronicifolia and probably other species, if not all.
Despite their chemical defenses, brickellbushes are food for caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera. These include the noctuid moths Schinia trifascia, Schinia oleagina, which is known only from Brickellia, Schinia buta, which is only known from B. californica, and Schinia gracilenta, which is only known from B. eupatorioides.
The genus is named for John Brickell, 1748–1809, Irish-born physician and naturalist.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hinckley's brickellbush thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, typical of its desert origins. It requires minimal watering once established and has very low fertilizer needs, preferring poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soil. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; adapted to poor desert soils. A very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once annually in spring, or often not needed at all.
