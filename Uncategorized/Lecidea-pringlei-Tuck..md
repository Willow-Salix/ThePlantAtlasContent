## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
Lecidea pringlei is a desert-dwelling lichen that requires high direct sunlight and extremely arid conditions. It does not need traditional watering or fertilization, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the environment. Mimic its harsh native habitat for successful 'care'.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the atmosphere, dust, and rainfall.
