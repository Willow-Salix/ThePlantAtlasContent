## Introduction
Matricaria discoidea, commonly known as pineappleweed, wild chamomile, pineapple-mayweed, disc mayweed, and rayless mayweed, is an annual plant native to North America and/or northern Asia, introduced to Europe where it grows as a common herb of fields, gardens, and roadsides. It is in the daisy family Asteraceae. The flowers exude a chamomile/pineapple aroma when crushed. They are edible and have been used in salads (although they may become bitter by the time the plant blooms) and to make herbal tea.

## Care Guide
Pineapple-weed is a highly adaptable plant, thriving in full to partial sun, reflecting its common presence in open, disturbed temperate environments. It requires moderate watering in well-drained soil and has very low fertilizer needs, often succeeding in poor soil conditions. Its hardy and opportunistic nature makes it exceptionally low-maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soil; rich soil is not necessary and may not be beneficial.
