# Bog Orchid

*Pseudorchis SÃ©g.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Europe, parts of Asia (including Siberia and Caucasus regions), and North Africa, primarily in mountainous and sub-alpine areas. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Sub-alpine Bog and Fen |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Sun to Full Sun; thrives in bright conditions common in open meadows and bogs but prefers cooler temperatures and should be shielded from intense, scorching midday heat. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil is crucial, mimicking its bog and fen habitat; never allow the soil to dry out completely. High ambient humidity is highly beneficial, but ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal issues. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
This bog orchid thrives in cool, consistently moist conditions reminiscent of its native sub-alpine fens and meadows. Provide bright, partial to full sun exposure, ensuring the soil remains damp but well-drained and never waterlogged. Fertilize very sparingly during its active growing season to avoid nutrient burn.

### Fertilizer
Very light fertilization is recommended, as many bog environments are naturally nutrient-poor. Use a highly diluted, balanced fertilizer specifically formulated for orchids or bog plants during the active growing season, and avoid over-fertilizing.
