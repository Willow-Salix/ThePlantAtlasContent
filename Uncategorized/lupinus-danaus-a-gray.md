## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dana's Lupine prefers cool, high-altitude environments with full sun and exceptionally well-draining soil. Provide moderate, consistent moisture during the active growing season but prioritize excellent drainage to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization is rarely necessary due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen; excessive fertilization can be detrimental. If soil is very poor, a low-phosphorus, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
