## Care Guide
This tropical savanna grass thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings to mimic its native wet and dry seasons. It benefits from light fertilization during its active growth period, preferring well-draining soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly at half strength during the active growing season, as savanna soils are not typically nutrient-rich.
