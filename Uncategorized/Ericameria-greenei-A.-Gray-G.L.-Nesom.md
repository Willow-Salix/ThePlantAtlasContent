## Introduction
Ericameria is a genus of North American shrubs in the family Asteraceae.
Ericameria is known by the common names goldenbush, rabbitbrush, turpentine bush, and rabbitbush. Most are shrubs, but one species (E. parishii) can reach tree stature. They are distributed in western Canada (Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia) western United States (from the western Great Plains to the Pacific) and northern Mexico. Bright yellow flower heads adorn the plants in late summer. All the species have disc florets, while some have ray florets but others do not. Ericameria nauseosa, (synonym Chrysothamnus nauseosus), is known for its production of latex.

## Care Guide
Greene's Goldenbush is a highly drought-tolerant shrub perfectly suited for full sun exposure, mimicking its native arid scrubland habitat. It requires infrequent watering once established, preferring well-draining soil to completely dry out between applications. Fertilization is generally not necessary, as it thrives in lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Thrives in nutrient-poor soils. If growth is poor, a very light, slow-release general-purpose fertilizer can be applied in spring.
