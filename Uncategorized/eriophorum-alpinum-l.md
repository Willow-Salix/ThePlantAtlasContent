## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant requires consistently wet, boggy conditions and thrives in full sun, reflecting its native alpine and boreal bog habitats. Due to the naturally nutrient-poor soils of its origin, it has very low fertilizer requirements. Mimic a cool, open, and permanently waterlogged environment for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; native bog soils are typically nutrient-poor and acidic, so minimal to no fertilization is needed.
