## Care Guide
Heartleaf Evening Primrose thrives in full sun with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native open habitats in the southeastern U.S. It requires moderate watering and prefers average soil fertility, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant once established.

### Fertilizer
Prefers average to poor soil and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient.
