## Care Guide
Hairy Smotherweed thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, ideally mimicking its native coastal wetland habitat where it tolerates brackish water. This resilient plant has low fertilizer needs, adapting well to less fertile or disturbed soil types.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It is adapted to disturbed and often nutrient-poor or saline soils, therefore heavy fertilization is generally unnecessary and potentially harmful.
