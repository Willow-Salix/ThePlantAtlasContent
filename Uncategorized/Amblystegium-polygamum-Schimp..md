## Care Guide
This wetland moss thrives in consistently wet conditions, mimicking its native habitat in fens and marshes. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade, ensuring the substrate never dries out. It generally requires no fertilization due to its low nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements. Mosses are not heavy feeders; excess nutrients can be detrimental.
