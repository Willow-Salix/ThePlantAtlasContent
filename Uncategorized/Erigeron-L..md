*Erigeron L.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across North America, Europe, and Asia, with the highest diversity in North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grasslands and Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Given its prevalence in open meadows and woodland edges in its native climate, it generally requires abundant light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Its native climate experiences regular rainfall but also periods of dryness, indicating the plant prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil, tolerating some drought once established. Allow the top soil to dry out between waterings. |

## Care Guide
Fleabane is a resilient plant best suited for full sun to partial shade, reflecting its native open habitat. It requires moderate watering, preferring well-drained soil, and is highly adaptable to average to poor soil conditions, thus needing very little to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low. As many species are pioneer plants found in average to poor soils, heavy fertilization is not necessary and can even be detrimental. It thrives with minimal soil amendments.
