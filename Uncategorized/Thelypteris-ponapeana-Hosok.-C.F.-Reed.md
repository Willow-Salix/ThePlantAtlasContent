## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Pohnpei (Federated States of Micronesia), Caroline Islands, Micronesia |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light. As a rainforest understory plant, it should be protected from direct sunlight, which can easily scorch its fronds. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged. Requires frequent watering to simulate its humid native environment; ensure high humidity through misting or a pebble tray. |

## Introduction
Thelypteris (maiden ferns) is a genus of ferns in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, family Thelypteridaceae, order Polypodiales. Two radically different circumscriptions of the genus are in use as of January 2020. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the genus is a very small one with about two species. In other approaches, the genus is the only one in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, and so includes between 875 and 1083 species.
The genus name is from Greek thēlys "female" and pteris "fern". However, "female fern" usually refers to the common lady-fern.

## Care Guide
The Ponape Maiden Fern thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest, requiring consistently moist, well-draining soil, high humidity, and low to medium indirect light. Protect from direct sun and provide light, regular fertilization during growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., half-strength) every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
