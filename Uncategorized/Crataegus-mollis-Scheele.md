## Care Guide
This resilient tree thrives in temperate climates, preferring full sun to partial shade and fertile, well-drained soil. Provide moderate watering, particularly during establishment and dry spells, and fertilize sparingly if soil nutrients are low.

### Fertilizer
Generally not a heavy feeder; thrives in fertile, well-drained soil. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied annually in spring if soil quality is poor.
