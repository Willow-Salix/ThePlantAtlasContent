## Care Guide
This tropical shrub thrives in bright indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native Caribbean forest habitat. Provide regular moisture during its active growth and a balanced, diluted fertilizer monthly to support its health.

### Fertilizer
A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer applied monthly during the growing season (spring and summer) is beneficial. Organic compost can also enrich the soil.
