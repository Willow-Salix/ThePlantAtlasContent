## Care Guide
Cascade Luina thrives in conditions reminiscent of its cool, moist Pacific Northwest montane home, preferring bright indirect to partial sun. Ensure its well-draining soil remains consistently moist and provide moderate fertilization during active growth. This strategy supports vigorous health and lush foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer), especially if soil is not naturally rich in organic matter.
