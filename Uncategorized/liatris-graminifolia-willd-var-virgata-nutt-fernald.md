## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Virginia to Florida and west to Louisiana) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Open Woodland / Savanna |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) for robust growth and flowering, similar to its open prairie and savanna habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Once established, it is fairly drought-tolerant. Water moderately during dry spells, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, mimicking the seasonal rainfall patterns of its native grasslands. |

## 🌱 Overview
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, much like its native open grasslands and savannas. It is quite drought-tolerant once established, requiring only moderate watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be light, as it prefers average to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor, well-drained soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization; an annual application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is usually sufficient.
