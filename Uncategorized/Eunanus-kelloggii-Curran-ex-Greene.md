## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (California Floristic Province) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean climate (chaparral, foothill woodlands) with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight, especially morning sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Water regularly during its active growth period in late winter to spring, allowing the soil to dry out moderately between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal to no water during its summer dormancy. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Kellogg's Monkeyflower prefers a Mediterranean climate, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It requires consistent watering during its spring growing season but is highly drought-tolerant and enters dormancy during dry summers. Fertilization should be minimal, as it adapts well to lean to moderately fertile soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if grown in reasonably fertile soil. Avoid excessive feeding.
