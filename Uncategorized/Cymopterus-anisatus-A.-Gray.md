## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun, mimicking its arid native environment. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly, and has minimal fertilizer needs. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in early spring, but it often thrives without supplemental feeding.
