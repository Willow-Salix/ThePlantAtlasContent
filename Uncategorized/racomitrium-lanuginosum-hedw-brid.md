| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Boreal Forests, Exposed Temperate Heathlands, and upland coastal areas. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to bright indirect light. It thrives in exposed, unsheltered locations typical of moorlands and rocky outcrops. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture through high atmospheric humidity or frequent wetting, but crucially demands excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. It can tolerate periods of drought once established. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy moss thrives in bright, exposed conditions with good air circulation and high atmospheric humidity. It needs consistent moisture but absolutely requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Avoid over-fertilization, as it prefers nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required. This moss naturally grows in nutrient-poor, acidic substrates like rocks and peat, and high nutrient levels can be detrimental.
