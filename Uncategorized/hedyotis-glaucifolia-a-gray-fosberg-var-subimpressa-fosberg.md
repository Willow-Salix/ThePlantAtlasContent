## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical wet forest home, requiring consistent moisture and high humidity, along with bright indirect light. Avoid direct scorching sun and ensure well-draining soil to prevent root issues while providing moderate feeding during growth periods.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer. Tropical forest soils can be nutrient-rich but also have rapid nutrient cycling.
