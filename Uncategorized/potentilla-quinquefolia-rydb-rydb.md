| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in high light exposure typical of its open, high-altitude native environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, ensuring well-drained soil. Prefers consistent moisture during the growing season but is tolerant of occasional dry spells once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This alpine plant thrives in full sun and requires well-drained soil, mimicking its native rocky habitats. Provide moderate, consistent moisture throughout the growing season, but avoid waterlogging. Fertilization needs are minimal, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to lean, rocky soils. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer application in early spring is sufficient, or none if soil is reasonably fertile.
