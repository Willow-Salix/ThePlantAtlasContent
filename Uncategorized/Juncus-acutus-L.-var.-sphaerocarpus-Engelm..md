| **Native Origin** | Western North America (primarily California and Baja California) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Coastal Salt Marshes, Brackish Wetlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed marsh environments. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to submerged conditions; it thrives in shallow water or perpetually moist, mucky soil. Tolerates brackish water and must not be allowed to dry out. |

## Care Guide
The Round-fruited Sharp Rush requires a full sun location and consistently wet to submerged conditions, mimicking its native coastal marsh environment. Ensure constant moisture and provide low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to specific wetland soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. In its natural habitat, it adapts to varying nutrient levels in marsh soils. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer designed for aquatic plants can be applied sparingly if growth appears weak, but over-fertilization should be avoided.
