## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (coastal plain from New Jersey south to Florida and west to Louisiana) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Wetland/Bog |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun, as it naturally occurs in open pine flatwoods and savannas. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to saturated soil, mimicking its native bog and wet pineland habitats. Cannot tolerate drying out. |

## Introduction
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## Care Guide
This beaksedge thrives in conditions mirroring its native humid subtropical wetland environment, requiring full to partial sun and constantly saturated, acidic soil. Fertilization should be minimal due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low to very low; bog plants are adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and can be harmed by excessive fertilization.
