## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western Idaho, USA (specifically, mountainous regions such as the Payette National Forest) |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Montane Shrubland/Grassland (characterized by cold winters, dry summers, and open, rocky slopes) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; requires significant direct light exposure for optimal growth. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and deep watering; highly drought-tolerant once established. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Lomatium is a genus in the family Apiaceae. It consists of about 100 species. Its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery. Native to western Northern America and northern Mexico, some Lomatium species are extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Pacific Northwest as a staple food.

## Care Guide
Brunsfeld's desertparsley thrives in full to partial sun within well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native semi-arid montane environment. This plant is drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent, deep watering once established, and has minimal fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements; thrives in lean, well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
