## Introduction
Euphorbia maculata, known as spotted spurge, prostrate spurge (not to be confused with Euphorbia prostrata), milk purslane, or spotted sandmat,  is a fast-growing annual plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to North America, where it is generally considered a common weed. It can be found in disturbed soils such as garden beds, along railroad tracks, and in the cracks of sidewalks. It has become a common introduced species throughout the world, including Europe, Japan, Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.

It grows in sunny locations and a variety of soils, and functions as a pioneer species in ecological succession. The sap of this plant is a mild skin irritant and can cause a rash in some people. The milky sap of plants in genus Euphorbia is poisonous and considered carcinogenic.

## Care Guide
Prostrate Spurge (Euphorbia chamaesyce auct. non L.) thrives in full sun and prefers dry conditions, tolerating drought exceptionally well. It requires minimal watering and no regular fertilization, as it is adapted to poor, disturbed soils. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; thrives in poor, nutrient-deficient soils.
