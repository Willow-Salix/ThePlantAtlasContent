| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern circumboreal regions, including Scandinavia, British Isles, Alps, Arctic/Subarctic North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada), and parts of Siberia, typically in montane or arctic zones. |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate/Alpine, found in very damp, calcareous microhabitats such as wet rocks, flushes, or springs. |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light; thrives in consistently shaded or partially shaded conditions, avoiding direct sunlight which can cause dehydration. |
| **Watering** | Keep substrate consistently moist but not waterlogged; requires high ambient humidity. Mimic natural seepage or constant dampness found in its native wet rock and spring environments. |

## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in cool, consistently moist, and highly humid environments with low to moderate indirect light. Ensure the substrate is always damp, and provide excellent air circulation to prevent mold while maintaining high humidity. Minimal fertilization is required, as it prefers nutrient-poor, calcareous conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Minimal fertilization, if any, is needed. Liverworts are not heavy feeders and prefer nutrient-poor, calcareous substrates.
