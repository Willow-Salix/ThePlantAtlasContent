## Introduction
Zephyranthes atamasca, commonly known as the atamasco lily, occasionally as the Easter lily or more generally a rain-lily, is native to the Southern United States.  It grows in swampy forests and coastal prairies, preferring acid boggy soils rich with leaf mold.  Following the appearance of broad, grassy leaves in early winter, it blooms in March or April. It has several narrow, linear basal leaves about 0.5 in (13 mm) wide and 10–15 in (25–38 cm) long.
Its native range extends from Florida north to Maryland and west to Mississippi. The species is also naturalized in Bermuda and in the Mariana Islands. Both its leaves and bulbs are poisonous.
