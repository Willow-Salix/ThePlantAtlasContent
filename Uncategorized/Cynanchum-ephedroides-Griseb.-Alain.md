## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Puerto Rico |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Dry Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Requires bright, direct sunlight for most of the day, typical of open dry forest or scrubland environments. Can tolerate some afternoon shade. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant; allow the soil to dry out completely between thorough waterings. Infrequent watering is key to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Cynanchum is a genus of about 300 species including some swallowworts, belonging to the family Apocynaceae. The taxon name comes from Greek kynos (meaning "dog") and anchein ("to choke"), hence the common name for several species is dog-strangling vine. Most species are non-succulent climbers or twiners. There is some evidence of toxicity.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright, direct sunlight and requires minimal water, reflecting its native subtropical dry forest habitat. It is drought-tolerant and benefits from infrequent but deep watering, with low to moderate fertilization during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization during the active growing season (spring to summer). A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks should suffice.
