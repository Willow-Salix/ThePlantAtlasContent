## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (mountainous regions of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, California, Nevada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine Montane/Temperate Dry, characterized by cold, snowy winters and dry, sunny summers with well-drained, often rocky soils. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. This plant thrives in open, exposed environments typical of high-altitude and montane slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate watering. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native rocky habitats that experience seasonal moisture (often from snowmelt) followed by dry periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This subalpine buckwheat thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native rocky mountain habitats. It requires low to moderate watering, being drought-tolerant once established, and benefits from minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Adapted to lean, rocky, and often nutrient-poor soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
