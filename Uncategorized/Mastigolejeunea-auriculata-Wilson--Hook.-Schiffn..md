# Mastigolejeunea auriculata

*Mastigolejeunea auriculata (Wilson & Hook.) Schiffn.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across tropical and subtropical Asia, Oceania (including Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand), and parts of Africa (e.g., Madagascar, Reunion). |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest / Subtropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to very indirect light. Thrives in deeply shaded or dappled light conditions, protected from direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and a continuously moist (but not waterlogged) substrate. Frequent misting is beneficial, and good air circulation is key to prevent rot while maintaining humidity. |

## Care Guide
This liverwort demands high humidity and consistently moist, non-soggy conditions, mimicking its native rainforest habitat. Provide very low to indirect light, avoiding any direct sun, and fertilize extremely sparingly or not at all to prevent nutrient burn.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. If used, apply an extremely diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/8th strength of an orchid fertilizer) very infrequently, perhaps once a month during active growth.
