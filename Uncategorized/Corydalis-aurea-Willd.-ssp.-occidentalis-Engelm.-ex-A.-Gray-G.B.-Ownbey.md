## Introduction
Corydalis (from Greek korydalís "crested lark") is a genus of about 540 species of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Papaveraceae, native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere and the high mountains of tropical eastern Africa. They are most diverse in China and the Himalayas, with at least 357 species in China. Corydalis species are the only dicots having only a single cotyledon (seed leaf).

## Care Guide
Western Golden Corydalis prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between applications, as it adapts to seasonal dry spells. Light fertilization can support its growth as an annual or biennial, especially in poorer soils.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization or average soil fertility; does not require rich soil and can be sensitive to over-fertilization.
