## 🌱 Overview
Solanum is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants, which include three food crops of high economic importance: the potato, the tomato and the eggplant (aubergine, brinjal). It is the largest genus in the nightshade family Solanaceae, comprising around 1,500 species. It also contains the so-called horse nettles (unrelated to the genus of true nettles, Urtica), as well as numerous plants cultivated for their ornamental flowers and fruit.
Solanum species show a wide range of growth habits, such as annuals and perennials, vines, subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees. Many formerly independent genera like Lycopersicon (the tomatoes) and Cyphomandra are now included in Solanum as subgenera or sections. Thus, the genus today contains roughly 1,500–2,000 species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical plant thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light, mimicking its native forest understory environment. Maintain consistently moist soil, ensuring good drainage, and provide moderate fertilization during active growth. Protect from harsh direct sun and prolonged drought periods.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding during the growing season (spring/summer). Use a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks or a slow-release granular fertilizer once a season. Reduce or stop in fall/winter.
