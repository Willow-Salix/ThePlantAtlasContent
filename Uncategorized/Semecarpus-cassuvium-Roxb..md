## Care Guide
The Wild Cashew thrives in warm, humid tropical rainforest conditions, requiring full to partial sun for optimal growth. It needs consistently moist, well-draining soil and benefits from moderate fertilization during its primary growth period. Handle with care as some plants in this genus can cause skin irritation.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer) to support robust growth in nutrient-rich forest litter.
