## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central America (specifically Mexico and Guatemala) |
| **Climate** | Sub-tropical to Temperate Highlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth, vibrant coloration, and abundant flowering, mimicking its open habitat. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is preferred, especially during active growth, similar to areas with moderate rainfall. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot; tolerates some drought once established. |

## Introduction
Amaranthus is a cosmopolitan group of more than 50 species which make up the genus of annual or short-lived perennial plants collectively known as amaranths. Some names include "prostrate pigweed" and "love lies bleeding". Some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables, pseudocereals, and ornamental plants.
Catkin-like cymes of densely packed flowers grow in summer or fall. Amaranth varies in flower, leaf, and stem color with a range of striking pigments from the spectrum of maroon to crimson and can grow longitudinally from 1 to 2.5 metres (3 to 8 feet) tall with a cylindrical, succulent, fibrous stem that is hollow with grooves and bracteoles when mature.
There are approximately 75 species in the genus, 10 of which are dioecious and native to North America, and the remaining 65 are monoecious species that are endemic to every continent (except Antarctica) from tropical lowlands to the Himalayas. Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus Celosia. Amaranth grain is collected from the genus. The leaves of some species are also eaten.

## Care Guide
This adaptable ornamental and grain plant flourishes in conditions similar to its native Central American highlands. Provide full sun exposure and maintain consistent soil moisture, allowing for slight drying between waterings. While not overly demanding, a moderately fertile soil will support its vigorous growth and impressive plumes.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in moderately fertile to rich, well-draining soil. Benefits from an all-purpose balanced fertilizer applied monthly during the growing season, especially if soil is poor, reflecting its history as a cultivated food crop.
