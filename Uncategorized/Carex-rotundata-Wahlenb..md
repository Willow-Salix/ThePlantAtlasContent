| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions, including northern North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada), northern Europe (e.g., Fennoscandia), and northern Asia (e.g., Siberia). |
| **Climate** | Arctic and Subarctic Tundra, Boreal Wetlands. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; it typically grows in open, exposed bog and fen environments. |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to waterlogged; requires constantly moist soil, often with standing water, mimicking its native bog, fen, and wet tundra habitats. |

## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Round Sedge thrives in very wet, acidic, and nutrient-poor conditions typical of its native arctic and subarctic bogs and fens. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure the soil remains consistently waterlogged. Avoid rich fertilization as it is adapted to low-nutrient environments.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils common in its native wetlands, supplemental fertilization is generally not needed.
