## 🧤 Care Instructions
White Indigoberry is a resilient plant best suited for full sun to partial shade with well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant but benefits from moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between applications. Fertilize lightly during the active growing season for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once or twice during the growing season (spring/summer) is sufficient, or none if the soil is naturally fertile.
