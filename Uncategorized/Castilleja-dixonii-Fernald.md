## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Coastal California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, typical of open coastal scrub and grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season (spring), allowing soil to dry between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established; requires significantly less water during dry summer months. |

## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
Dixon's Indian Paintbrush thrives in full to partial sun with excellent drainage, mimicking its native coastal California habitat. Water moderately during spring growth, then reduce significantly as it tolerates drought in summer. It requires minimal fertilization, benefiting from its hemiparasitic nature.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a hemiparasitic plant, it derives nutrients from the roots of host plants, thriving in naturally less fertile soils.
