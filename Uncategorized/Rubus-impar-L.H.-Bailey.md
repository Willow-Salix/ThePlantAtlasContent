## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Ohio River Valley region of the central-eastern United States (primarily southwestern Indiana and adjacent areas of Kentucky, Illinois) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sun daily for optimal growth and fruit production, as found in clearings and forest edges) |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture, especially during the growing season; moderate to frequent watering is necessary to prevent soil from drying out completely, ensuring well-drained soil to avoid waterlogging typical of temperate forest floors. |

## Introduction
Rubus is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, subfamily Rosoideae, most commonly known as brambles. Fruits of various species are known as raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, and bristleberries. It is a diverse genus, with the estimated number of Rubus species varying from 250 to over 1000, found across all continents except Antarctica.
Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles like roses; spines, bristles, and gland-tipped hairs are also common in the genus. The Rubus fruit, sometimes called a bramble fruit, is an aggregate of drupelets. The term cane fruit or cane berry applies to any Rubus species or hybrid which is commonly grown with supports such as wires or canes, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry. The stems of such plants are also referred to as canes.

## Care Guide
The Posey County Blackberry thrives in conditions mirroring its native temperate deciduous forest, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires consistent moisture in well-drained, organically rich soil to support its growth and fruit development. An annual feeding with compost or a balanced fertilizer in spring will promote a healthy and productive plant.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, thriving in nutrient-rich, organically enhanced soils. Benefits from annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring, reflecting the rich detritus of its native forest habitat.
