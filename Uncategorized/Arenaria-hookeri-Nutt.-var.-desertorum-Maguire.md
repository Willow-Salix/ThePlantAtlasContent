## Care Guide
This Desert Sandwort thrives in full sun and very well-draining, rocky soils mimicking its native arid montane environment. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant, requiring minimal and infrequent watering once established to prevent root rot. Fertilization needs are very low.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils; excessive fertilization can harm it. A very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring, if at all, is sufficient.
