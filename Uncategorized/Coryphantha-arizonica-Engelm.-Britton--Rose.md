## Introduction
Coryphantha (from Greek, "flowering on the top"), or beehive cactus, is a genus of small to middle-sized, globose or columnar cacti. The genus is native to arid parts of Central America, Mexico, through Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas and north into southwestern, central, and southeastern Montana. With its two subgenera, 57 species and 20 subspecies, it is one of the largest genera of cactus.

## Care Guide
This desert cactus demands full sun and very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between applications to replicate its arid native conditions. Fertilize sparingly with a low-nitrogen formula during its active growth. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent any moisture-related issues.

### Fertilizer
Low; apply a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/early summer). Desert soils are generally nutrient-poor.
