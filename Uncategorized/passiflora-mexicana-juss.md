## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mexico (primarily northern and central regions, including states like Sonora, Sinaloa, Baja California Sur, Durango, Zacatecas) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-Arid Tropical Scrubland/Dry Deciduous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is ideal. It can tolerate some afternoon shade in extremely hot desert climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water deeply but infrequently; during the active growing season (spring/summer), more consistent watering can be beneficial, but always ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Mexican passionflower thrives in sunny, dry conditions akin to its native scrubland habitat, requiring abundant sunlight and excellent drainage. It is highly drought-tolerant, preferring deep, infrequent watering and only light fertilization during its active growth period to encourage flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate feeder. Apply a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength once a month during the active growing season (spring/summer). Reduce or cease fertilization in fall and winter.
