## 🌱 Overview
Manfreda was a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Agavoideae. Along with Polianthes, members are commonly called tuberoses. The generic name honours 14th-century Italian writer Manfredus de Monte Imperiale.
Manfreda species, like those in related genera Agave and Polianthes, have rosettes of leaves branching from a very short stem, and flowers at the end of a long stalk. The flowers are tubular and whitish, yellow, green, or brownish, with lengthy stamens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in bright, direct light, mimicking its native arid Mexican grasslands. It requires infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and benefits from minimal fertilization during its growth period to prevent overfeeding.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; fertilize lightly with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season.
