## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Arctic and subarctic North America, Europe, and Asia, as well as alpine zones in temperate mountains (e.g., Rocky Mountains, European Alps). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Arctic Tundra (specifically wet meadows, fens, and bogs within these biomes). |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun. Thrives in open, exposed environments typical of tundra and alpine zones where direct sunlight is common. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native habitat in boggy areas, fens, and stream banks. Should never be allowed to dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
The Twotipped Sedge thrives in cold, wet, and open environments. Provide full to partial sun exposure and maintain consistently wet, nutrient-poor soil to mimic its native alpine and arctic tundra habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low. Native to nutrient-poor, often acidic soils. Minimal or no fertilization is generally needed; excessive fertilizer can be detrimental.
