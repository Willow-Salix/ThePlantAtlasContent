## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical Americas, including various Caribbean islands (e.g., Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico), Central America (e.g., Mexico), and northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Cloud Forest understories. |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low light to deep shade. This plant is highly sensitive to light and should be protected from any direct sun, thriving in environments with dappled or ambient light only, typical of a dense forest floor or ravine. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires extremely high and consistent humidity (80%+) and continuously moist, but not waterlogged, substrate. The delicate fronds absorb moisture directly, so regular misting or placement in a closed terrarium/vivarium is essential to prevent desiccation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Trichomanes is a genus of ferns in the family Hymenophyllaceae, termed bristle ferns. The circumscription of the genus is disputed. All ferns in the genus are filmy ferns, with leaf tissue typically 2 cells thick.  This thinness generally necessitates a permanently humid habitat, and makes the fronds somewhat translucent. Because of this membrane-like frond tissue, the plant is prone to drying out. "Filmy ferns" in the taxa Hymenophyllaceae grow in constantly wet environments. Many are found in cloud forests such as "Choco" in Colombia. There are also members of the taxa that can grow submersed in water. 
The name bristle fern refers to the small bristle that protrudes from the indusia of these ferns.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Toothed Bristle Fern requires an environment mimicking its native tropical rainforest understory, demanding extremely high humidity and consistently moist conditions. Provide very low light and protect from direct sun, as its delicate fronds are highly susceptible to drying out and scorching. Fertilize sparingly to maintain its health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very light to minimal. These ferns are not heavy feeders; use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 strength or less) very sparingly, perhaps once or twice during the active growing season, or rely on a slow-release, low-dose option.
