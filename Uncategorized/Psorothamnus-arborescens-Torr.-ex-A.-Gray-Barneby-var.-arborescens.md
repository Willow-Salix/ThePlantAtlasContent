## Introduction
Psorothamnus is a genus of plants in the legume family. These are shrubs and small trees. Many are known by the general common name indigo bush. Some are referred to as daleas, as this genus was once included in genus Dalea. These are generally thorny, thickly branched, strongly scented bushes. Most species bear lupinlike raceme inflorescences of bright purple legume flowers and gland-rich pods. Psorothamnus species are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.
The genus formerly included additional species, but was found to be paraphyletic, and genus Psorodendron was reinstated to accommodate sections Xylodalea, Capnodendron, and Winnemucca.

## Care Guide
This desert-adapted shrub thrives in full, intense sun and is highly drought-tolerant, requiring very infrequent watering once established. It prefers poor, well-draining soil and generally does not need significant fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in nutrient-poor soils and generally does not require supplemental feeding once established.
