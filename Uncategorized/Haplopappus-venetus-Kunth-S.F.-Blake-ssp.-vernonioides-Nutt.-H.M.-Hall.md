## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for drought-tolerant landscapes. It requires minimal watering once established and generally needs little to no fertilizer. Emulate its native Mediterranean habitat for best results, focusing on ample sunlight and infrequent but thorough watering.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically not required once established. If planted in very poor soil or growth is sluggish, a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial.
