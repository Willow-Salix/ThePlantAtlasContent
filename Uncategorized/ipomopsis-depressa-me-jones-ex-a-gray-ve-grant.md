## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native arid scrubland environment. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to completely dry out between irrigations, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Fertilization is generally not needed, as it prefers lean soils.
