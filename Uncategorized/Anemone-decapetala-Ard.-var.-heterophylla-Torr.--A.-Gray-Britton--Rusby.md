## Introduction
Anemone () is a genus of flowering plants in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae. Plants of the genus are commonly called windflowers. They are native to the temperate and subtropical regions of all regions except Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-draining soil, mimicking its native prairie and woodland environments. Provide consistent, moderate moisture during its active spring growth, then significantly reduce watering as it typically goes dormant in the summer. Its fertilizer needs are minimal, benefiting most from organically rich soil.

### Fertilizer
Low; a light application of balanced fertilizer or compost in early spring is generally sufficient for healthy growth.
