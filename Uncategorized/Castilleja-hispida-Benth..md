## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including British Columbia (Canada) and states like Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming (USA). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Open Montane Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat on open, exposed slopes and meadows. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering once established; it prefers dry to moderately moist conditions and well-drained soil, reflecting its native dry slopes and prairies. Overwatering can be detrimental. |

## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
Harsh Indian Paintbrush thrives in full sun and very well-drained, often lean or rocky soils. Due to its hemiparasitic nature, it requires minimal watering once established and should not be heavily fertilized, preferring its natural host plants for nutrient uptake.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; it is hemiparasitic, drawing nutrients from the roots of host plants. Rich soils or excessive fertilization can be harmful.
