## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Specific native origin cannot be determined. 'Rubus amplificatus (Bab.) E. Less [excluded]' is an unaccepted or excluded scientific name, often associated with historical European bramble classifications where distinct species were difficult to delineate. |
| **Climate** | Specific native climate cannot be determined. As an excluded name, its precise ecological niche is not defined. The Rubus genus generally thrives in temperate climates. |
| **Sunlight** | Cannot be accurately extrapolated for this specific excluded taxon. In general, Rubus species prefer full sun to partial shade, depending on the specific species and cultivar. |
| **Watering** | Cannot be accurately extrapolated for this specific excluded taxon. Most Rubus species require consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during active growth and fruiting periods, reflective of moderate rainfall. |

## Introduction
Rubus is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, subfamily Rosoideae, most commonly known as brambles. Fruits of various species are known as raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, and bristleberries. It is a diverse genus, with the estimated number of Rubus species varying from 250 to over 1000, found across all continents except Antarctica.
Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles like roses; spines, bristles, and gland-tipped hairs are also common in the genus. The Rubus fruit, sometimes called a bramble fruit, is an aggregate of drupelets. The term cane fruit or cane berry applies to any Rubus species or hybrid which is commonly grown with supports such as wires or canes, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry. The stems of such plants are also referred to as canes.
