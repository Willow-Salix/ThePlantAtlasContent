## 🧤 Care Instructions
Wild Lupine thrives in full to partial sun with well-drained soil, mimicking its native temperate grassland and woodland edge environment. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and generally needs little to no fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, preferring lean conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer, especially nitrogen, as it is a nitrogen-fixing legume. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, sandy soils.
