## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (southeastern California, southern Nevada) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland/Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, thriving in direct, intense sunlight characteristic of its native desert habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering during its active growing season (typically late winter to spring); allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant. |

## Introduction
Nemacladus is a genus of flowering plants in the bellflower family known generally as threadplants. Species are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These are annual herbs with very slender, sometimes threadlike, branching stems bearing small five-lobed flowers.

## Care Guide
The Mojave Dwarf thrives in full sun with excellent drainage, mimicking its native arid desert environment. It requires minimal, infrequent watering, especially during its short growing cycle, and has very low fertilizer needs. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils and does not require significant fertilization.
