## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North Coast Ranges of California, USA (specifically Trinity County) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Montane Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is essential for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Very low; highly drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly, only during extended dry periods, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## Care Guide
Dubakella Mountain Buckwheat thrives in full sun and requires extremely well-drained, lean soils. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing very little water once established, and does not require fertilization. Provide conditions mimicking its native dry, rocky, montane habitat.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; this plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky, often serpentine soils. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental.
