## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its arid scrubland habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to completely dry out between waterings, and avoid heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; native soils are typically low in organic matter. If potted, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once a year might suffice.
