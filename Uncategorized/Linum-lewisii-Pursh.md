## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (from Alaska and British Columbia south to Baja California, and east to Texas and the Dakotas) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland, Montane, Semi-arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly and infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Linum (flax) is a genus of approximately 200 species in the flowering plant family Linaceae. They are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the world. The genus includes the common flax (L. usitatissimum), the bast fibre of which is used to produce linen and the seeds to produce linseed oil.

The flowers of most species are blue or yellow, rarely red, white, or pink, and some are heterostylous. There is an average of 6 to 10 seeds per boll.
Linum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the cabbage moth, the nutmeg, the setaceous Hebrew character and Coleophora striolatella, which feeds exclusively on Linum narbonense.

## Care Guide
Lewis Flax is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and requires minimal water once established, tolerating drought conditions. It prefers lean, well-drained soils and generally does not need fertilization, making it ideal for xeriscaping or native plant gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required. It thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-drained soils and does not tolerate rich, heavily fertilized conditions.
