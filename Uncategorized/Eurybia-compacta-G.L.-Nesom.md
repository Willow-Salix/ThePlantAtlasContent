## Care Guide
This aster thrives in open, sunny to partly shaded locations with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular watering during dry spells is crucial for optimal health, and while it's not a heavy feeder, enriching the soil with organic matter will support vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeder. It generally thrives in average garden soil enriched with organic matter; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly if soil quality is poor.
