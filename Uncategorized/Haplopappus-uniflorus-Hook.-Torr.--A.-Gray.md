## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically subalpine and alpine regions of the Rocky Mountains and Cascade Range, across US states like Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Canadian provinces British Columbia and Alberta. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine Montane Meadows/Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in bright, exposed conditions typical of high-elevation open areas. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between applications. It is adapted to well-drained conditions and can tolerate some drought once established. |

## Introduction
Haplopappus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae found in South America, mostly restricted to the dry regions of the Southern Andes, Chilean Matorral, and Patagonia.

## Care Guide
Lyall's Goldenweed is a hardy alpine perennial that prefers full sun exposure and well-drained, lean soil. It requires moderate, consistent moisture during its growing season, but should not be waterlogged. Minimal fertilization is necessary, reflecting its adaptation to high-elevation, nutrient-scarce environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental. A very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring if growth seems weak.
