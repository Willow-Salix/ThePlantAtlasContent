## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia, particularly in mountainous and rocky areas. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Rocky Outcrops |
| **Sunlight** | High light; full sun to partial sun is ideal, mimicking its natural habitat on exposed rocks. |
| **Watering** | Moderate; this lichen thrives with periods of wetting and drying. Provide water through misting or occasional rain, allowing complete drying between moisture exposures. |

## Introduction
Fuscidea is a genus of crustose lichens in the family Fuscideaceae. It has about 40 species. The genus was circumscribed in 1972 by lichenologists Volkmar Wirth and Antonín Vězda, with Fuscidea aggregatilis assigned as the type species.

## Care Guide
This saxicolous lichen requires high light exposure and good air circulation, replicating its exposed rock habitat. It absorbs moisture directly from the atmosphere and needs distinct cycles of wetness and complete dryness. Avoid any fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-scarce conditions.

### Fertilizer
None; lichens are highly adapted to nutrient-poor environments and conventional fertilizers can be harmful.
