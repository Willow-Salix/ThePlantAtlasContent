## Care Guide
The Tropical Rose Mallow thrives in warm, tropical conditions with abundant sunlight and consistent moisture. Provide a balanced fertilizer during its active growth phase to encourage prolific blooming, ensuring well-draining soil to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding during the growing season (spring through autumn) with a balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer, perhaps every 2-4 weeks, especially when flowering.
