## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in cool, bright conditions with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Mimic its native rocky, high-altitude environment by providing good air circulation and very lean nutrients to prevent overgrowth and stress.

### Fertilizer
Requires very light fertilization, if any, with a highly diluted balanced formula once or twice during the active growing period, as it prefers lean soils.
