## Introduction
Agave (; also UK: ; Anglo-Hispanic, also US: ) is a genus of monocots native to the arid regions of the Americas. The genus is primarily known for its succulent and xerophytic species that typically form large rosettes of strong, fleshy leaves.
Many plants in this genus may be considered perennial, because they require several to many years to mature and flower. However, most Agave species are more accurately described as monocarpic rosettes or multiannuals, since each individual rosette flowers only once and then dies; a small number of Agave species are polycarpic.
Along with plants from the closely related genera Yucca, Hesperoyucca, and Hesperaloe, various Agave species are popular ornamental plants in hot, dry climates, as they require very little supplemental water to survive. Most Agave species grow very slowly. Some Agave species are known by the common name "century plant".
Maguey is a Spanish word that refers to all of the large-leafed plants in the Asparagaceae family, including agaves and yuccas. Maguey flowers are eaten in many indigenous culinary traditions of Mesoamerica.
In other regions, it goes by different names; in China, it is referred to as Chinese: 龙舌兰, romanized: Lóngshélán, lit. 'dragon tongue orchid'.

## Care Guide
This agave thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrublands. Provide abundant sunlight and very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly. It has low fertilizer requirements and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; a diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
