## Care Guide
This plant is adapted to arid environments, thriving with ample sunlight and minimal water. Ensure excellent drainage and allow the soil to dry out between waterings to mimic its native conditions, avoiding over-fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly, perhaps once per growing season, especially if grown in poor soil.
