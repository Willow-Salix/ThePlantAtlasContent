## Care Guide
Sainfoin is a hardy, full-sun plant adapted to well-drained soils, characteristic of its native European and Asian grasslands. It requires moderate watering, is drought-tolerant once established, and benefits from its natural ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.

### Fertilizer
As a legume (Fabaceae), it fixes atmospheric nitrogen, so it generally has low to moderate fertilizer needs. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.
