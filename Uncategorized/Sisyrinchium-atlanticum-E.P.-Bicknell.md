## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (from Newfoundland south to Florida, and west to Louisiana and Oklahoma) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Humid Meadow/Open Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; best flowering occurs with ample direct light. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil; requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, as it naturally grows in moist meadows and along wet edges. Does not tolerate prolonged drought. |

## Introduction
Sisyrinchium is a large genus of annual to perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. Native to the New World, the species are known as blue-eyed grasses. Although they are not true grasses (Poaceae), they are monocots.
Several species in the eastern United States are threatened or endangered. This may be due to niche species emerging from their unique tendency toward rapid speciation which helps them adapt to specialized arenic (sandy) habitats.

## Care Guide
Eastern Blue-Eyed Grass thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist soil, mimicking its native habitat in humid meadows and open woodlands. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, and provide light fertilization in spring for optimal growth and abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring, especially if grown in lean soils.
