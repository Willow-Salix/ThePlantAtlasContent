## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions, including Greenland, northern North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada), northern Europe, and northern Asia. |
| **Climate** | Arctic/Subarctic Tundra and Boreal Zone, often found in exposed, acidic sites. |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to bright indirect light. Tolerates partial sun, especially morning sun, but avoid intense midday direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. High humidity is crucial, mimicking its often damp native microhabitats. |

## Care Guide
This bryophyte thrives in cool, consistently moist environments with moderate to bright indirect light, mirroring its native arctic/subarctic conditions. It requires high humidity and very little, if any, supplemental nutrients, preferring well-drained but perpetually damp substrates.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Bryophytes generally require minimal to no supplemental fertilization, thriving in nutrient-poor substrates.
