## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Greenland, Newfoundland, Labrador, Quebec, northeastern United States (e.g., Maine) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Wetlands and Bogs |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial sun to bright indirect light; thrives in open woodland edges or dappled light conditions. Avoid harsh, direct afternoon sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native bog and fen habitats. Never allow the substrate to dry out. High humidity is also beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
The genus Platanthera belongs to the subfamily Orchidoideae of the family Orchidaceae, and comprises about 150 species of orchids. The members of this genus, known as the butterfly orchids or fringed orchids, were previously included in the genus Orchis, which is a close relative (along with the genus Habenaria). They are distributed throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are terrestrial and have tubercules. The genomes of Platanthera zijinensis and Platanthera guangdongensis have been sequenced as model species to study partial and full mycoheterotrophy.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This orchid demands consistently moist to wet conditions and thrives in partial sun or bright indirect light. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, so fertilization should be minimal and highly diluted. Mimic its cool temperate wetland habitat for best results.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs. Use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) sparingly, perhaps once every 4-6 weeks during the growing season. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
