## Care Guide
Tuberculate Bulrush requires consistently saturated soil conditions, mimicking its native bog environment, and thrives in full sun exposure. It is well-adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils, meaning minimal to no fertilization is typically needed for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic bog soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a diluted bog-specific or balanced fertilizer if growth seems stunted.
