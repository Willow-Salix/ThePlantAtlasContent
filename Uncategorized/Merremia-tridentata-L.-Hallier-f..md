## Care Guide
This resilient vine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring moderate watering to mimic its native wet and dry season patterns. It is not a heavy feeder, benefiting from low to moderate fertilization during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season, as it's often found in less fertile, disturbed soils.
