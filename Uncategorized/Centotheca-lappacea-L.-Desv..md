## Care Guide
This tropical forest understory grass requires consistent soil moisture and prefers low to moderate, indirect light. Provide moderate fertilization during its active growth period, mimicking the nutrient conditions of its native habitat. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season, consistent with the steady nutrient supply from decomposing organic matter on a forest floor.
