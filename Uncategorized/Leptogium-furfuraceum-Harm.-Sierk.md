## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Appalachian Mountains), and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Humid Forests, particularly Montane Temperate Rainforests. |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light; prefers shaded or filtered light conditions, avoiding direct harsh sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires high atmospheric humidity and consistent moisture; frequent misting or exposure to ambient wetness is essential, ensuring the thallus remains moist but not waterlogged. |

## Introduction
Leptogium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Collemataceae. It has about 110 species. Species formerly classified under Leptogium have since been divided among the genera Leptogium, Pseudoleptogium, and Scytinium. Leptogium lichens are predominantly found on tree bark or soil, often among mosses, and sometimes on rocks in moist environments.

## Care Guide
This skin lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with filtered light, mimicking its native forest habitat. It requires consistent moisture through high atmospheric humidity or frequent misting, as it absorbs water directly. Avoid direct sunlight and any form of traditional fertilization, as lichens are highly sensitive to external nutrients and pollutants.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization is needed; highly sensitive to pollutants and excess nutrients from external sources.
