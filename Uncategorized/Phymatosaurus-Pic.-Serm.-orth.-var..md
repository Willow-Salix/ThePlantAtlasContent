# Monarch Fern

*Phymatosaurus Pic. Serm., orth. var.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of the Old World, including Southeast Asia, Australia, and Pacific Islands like Hawaii and Fiji. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect bright light to partial shade, mimicking the dappled light of a rainforest understory. Avoid direct sunlight which can scorch fronds. |
| **Watering** | Keep substrate consistently moist but never waterlogged. High humidity is crucial; regular misting, a pebble tray, or placement in a humid environment is highly beneficial. |

## Care Guide
This fern thrives in high humidity and indirect light, characteristic of its native rainforest understory. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil and provide light fertilization during active growth to mimic its natural epiphytic or lithophytic nutrient intake from decaying organic matter.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a diluted liquid fertilizer. As an epiphyte/lithophyte, it is not a heavy feeder and can be sensitive to over-fertilization.
