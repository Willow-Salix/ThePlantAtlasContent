## Introduction
Descurainia is a genus of plants in the family Brassicaceae which are known commonly as the tansymustards. The genus name commemorates French botanist and herbalist François Descurain (1658–1749). The plants are similar in appearance to other mustards, sending up long erect stems and bearing small yellow or whitish flowers. Many species are noxious weeds. Some species are toxic to livestock and become a nuisance when they grow in grazing fields. Plants of this genus are found worldwide in temperate regions. Descurainia sophia, (flixweed or herb sophia), is the type species of Descurainia.

## Care Guide
Western Tansy Mustard is a resilient plant best suited for full sun and well-draining, infertile soils. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing minimal water, and thrives on neglect rather than rich conditions. Avoid overwatering and excessive fertilization to ensure its success.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapts well to poor, nutrient-deficient soils and generally does not require fertilization.
