## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic regions, particularly Novaya Zemlya (Russia) |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate, diffuse light. Avoid intense direct sunlight which can cause desiccation. Adapted to long periods of low light intensity. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity is crucial. Requires moisture from misting, dew, or occasional rainfall; does not require traditional soil watering. Tolerates periods of desiccation. |

## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
This Arctic lichen thrives in very cold, humid environments with low to moderate diffuse light. It requires high atmospheric moisture and absolutely no fertilization. Protection from intense sunlight and desiccation is key for survival.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens are highly sensitive to nutrients and pollution; fertilization is detrimental.
