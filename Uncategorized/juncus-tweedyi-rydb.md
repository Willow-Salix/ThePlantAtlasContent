## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tweedy's Rush thrives in consistently wet conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade. Ensure the soil remains constantly moist or even has shallow standing water to mimic its native wetland environment. Fertilization needs are low to moderate, with a diluted liquid feed during the growing season being adequate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength during the growing season is generally sufficient, as native wetland soils are often organically rich.
