## 🌱 Overview
Collomia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. Species in the genus are known generally as trumpets, mountain trumpets, or trumpet flowers. They are native to North America and southern South America. The genus name comes from the Greek kolla ("glue"), a reference to the seeds, which become gelatinous in texture when wet.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Variableleaf Collomia is an annual native to Western North America, thriving in temperate woodlands and Mediterranean climates. It prefers bright indirect light to partial sun and consistent moisture during its spring growth. Minimal fertilization is needed, making it a relatively low-maintenance option for native plant gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Generally not required if planted in reasonably fertile soil. A light, balanced liquid fertilizer applied once or twice during early spring growth may benefit plants in very poor soils.
