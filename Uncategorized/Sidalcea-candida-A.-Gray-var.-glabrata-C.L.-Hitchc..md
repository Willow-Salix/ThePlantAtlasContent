## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Pacific Northwest (Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, Idaho) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Meadow/Moist Open Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open, exposed areas with direct light for most of the day, but can benefit from some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to regular watering. Requires consistently moist but well-draining soil, especially during its active growing season, mimicking its native habitat near streambanks and moist meadows. Tolerates short dry spells once established. |

## Introduction
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## Care Guide
This perennial flourishes in temperate climates, demanding full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It mimics its Pacific Northwest meadow habitat by requiring regular watering during the growing season and benefits from minimal fertilization to encourage healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It generally prefers average to rich, well-draining soils. An annual application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer or compost in spring is typically sufficient.
