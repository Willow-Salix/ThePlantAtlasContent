## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (primarily southwestern United States and Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright indirect light, as it grows on exposed rock surfaces. |
| **Watering** | Extremely low; relies on atmospheric moisture (dew, fog, infrequent rain) and can tolerate prolonged periods of desiccation. No traditional watering needed; occasional misting or exposure to humid air may be beneficial if grown in an artificial environment. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
Lecidea evansii is a saxicolous lichen thriving in arid, exposed conditions on siliceous rocks. It requires full sun and derives all its moisture from the atmosphere and infrequent rainfall, tolerating long dry spells. No fertilizer is needed, as it naturally collects nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
None; lichens acquire nutrients from the air and the substrate they grow on. Artificial fertilizers are detrimental.
