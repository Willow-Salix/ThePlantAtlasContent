| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland to Desert |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun; requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, replicating its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Very drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Infrequent deep watering is preferred over frequent shallow watering. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid and desert environments. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established, and generally has low fertilizer needs. Provide conditions that emulate its dry, sunny, and open native habitat for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in lean soils and typically does not require fertilization in average garden conditions. If growth is poor, a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring may be applied.
