## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern Utah, United States (primarily Zion National Park and surrounding areas) |
| **Climate** | Arid Montane Scrubland/Woodland (Subalpine) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate. Highly drought-tolerant once established; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic its native arid conditions. |

## Introduction
Ericameria is a genus of North American shrubs in the family Asteraceae.
Ericameria is known by the common names goldenbush, rabbitbrush, turpentine bush, and rabbitbush. Most are shrubs, but one species (E. parishii) can reach tree stature. They are distributed in western Canada (Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia) western United States (from the western Great Plains to the Pacific) and northern Mexico. Bright yellow flower heads adorn the plants in late summer. All the species have disc florets, while some have ray florets but others do not. Ericameria nauseosa, (synonym Chrysothamnus nauseosus), is known for its production of latex.

## Care Guide
Subalpine Goldenbush thrives in full sun and exceptionally well-drained soil, replicating its native arid montane environment. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal watering and fertilization, preferring lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to lean, rocky soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring only if growth appears weak.
