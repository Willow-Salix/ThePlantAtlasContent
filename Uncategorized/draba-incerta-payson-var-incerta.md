## 🧤 Care Instructions
Yellowstone Draba thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean, rocky soil, mirroring its native alpine habitat. Provide consistent moisture during its spring growth phase, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings later in the season. Minimal to no fertilization is required for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean, poor, rocky soils. Heavy fertilization should be avoided as it can harm this alpine species.
