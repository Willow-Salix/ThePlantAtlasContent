## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
Thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native coastal scrubland habitat. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum as it is adapted to lean soils and may be hemiparasitic.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none; native to nutrient-poor soils and often hemiparasitic, excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
