## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Sierra Nevada mountains of California and Oregon, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine Montane Climate |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving in open, exposed areas typical of high mountain meadows and slopes. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist but exceptionally well-drained soil, mimicking the snowmelt and summer rainfall patterns of its native habitat; avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Train's Indian Paintbrush thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soil. Provide consistent moisture during its active growth period without ever allowing the soil to become waterlogged. Avoid excessive fertilization as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions and can be hemiparasitic.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers lean to moderately fertile soil. Due to its hemiparasitic nature and adaptation to nutrient-poor mountain environments, avoid rich, heavily fertilized soils.
