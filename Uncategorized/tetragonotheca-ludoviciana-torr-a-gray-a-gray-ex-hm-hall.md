## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in sunny, well-draining locations typical of its native humid subtropical environment. Provide moderate water, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and use fertilizer sparingly to emulate its natural habitat. Its robust nature makes it relatively low-maintenance once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. If planted in poor soil, a light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring may be beneficial. Avoid over-fertilizing as this plant is adapted to moderate-to-low nutrient conditions.
