## 🧤 Care Instructions
This prairie native thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, tolerating a range of soil types from average to poor. Water moderately, ensuring the soil isn't waterlogged, and it will become drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization is generally not needed, as it prefers leaner conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of compost can be beneficial in very poor soils.
