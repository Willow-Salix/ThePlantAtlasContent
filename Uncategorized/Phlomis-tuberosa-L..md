## Introduction
Phlomis is a genus of over 100 species of herbaceous plants, subshrubs and shrubs in the mint family Lamiaceae, native from the Mediterranean region east across central Asia to China.
The name Phlomis derives from a Greek word for "flame", and may refer to the leaves' use in ancient times as lamp wicks. Common names include Jerusalem sage and lampwick plant.

## Care Guide
Phlomis tuberosa thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, reflecting its origins in temperate steppes. It is highly drought tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilization. Ensure good air circulation to prevent issues.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. A light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, but often not necessary.
