## Introduction
Crescentia (calabash tree, huingo, krabasi, or kalebas) is a genus of six species of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae, native to Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America. The species are moderate-size trees growing to 10 m (35 ft) tall, and producing large spherical fruits, with a thin, hard shell and soft pulp, up to 25 cm (10 in) in diameter.

## Care Guide
This critically endangered tree from Puerto Rico thrives in conditions replicating its tropical wet forest home. Provide bright, indirect to partial sun, maintain consistently moist soil with good drainage, and offer moderate fertilization during its growth period to ensure optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization with a balanced, slow-release formula, applied during the active growing season to support its specific nutrient needs in tropical soils.
