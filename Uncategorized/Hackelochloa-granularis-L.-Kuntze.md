## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical Africa, Asia (from India to Southeast Asia), and Northern Australia |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Open Woodlands, and Savannahs |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily). It thrives in open, brightly lit conditions, typical of its native grassland habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Prefers consistently moist soil during its active growing season, reflecting the seasonal rainfall of its native regions. Allow the topsoil to dry out slightly between waterings, as it tolerates short dry spells. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
This tropical and subtropical grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Provide moderate, consistent watering during its active growing season, allowing the soil surface to dry slightly between applications. It requires minimal fertilization for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a grass often found in disturbed or less fertile areas, it does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during its active growth period is generally sufficient.
