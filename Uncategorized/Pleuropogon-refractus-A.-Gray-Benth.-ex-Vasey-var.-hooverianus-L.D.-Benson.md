## Care Guide
This grass thrives in full sun with high moisture during its active growing season in winter and spring, mimicking its native vernal pool habitat. It requires consistently wet soil during this period, followed by a dry dormancy in summer, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light application of balanced fertilizer once a year in early spring may suffice.
