## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (British Columbia south to California, east to Idaho and Montana) |
| **Climate** | Temperate woodlands, scrub, and grasslands with distinct wet and dry seasons |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to bright indirect light; tolerates some direct morning sun but prefers protection from harsh afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings; avoid constantly soggy conditions. |

## Introduction
Sceptridium is a genus of seedless vascular plants in the family Ophioglossaceae, closely allied to (and often included as a subgenus of) the genus Botrychium (the moonworts and grapeferns).  It is also closely related to the genus Botrypus (the rattlesnake fern, often treated as the subgenus Osmundopteris under Botrychium). Sceptridium species are commonly called the grape-ferns.
These plants are small with fleshy roots, and reproduce by spores shed into the air. They differ from the moonworts in having at least some sterile fronds (all fronds in Botrychium are spore-bearing), and in the fronds being bi- or tri-pinnate (Botrychium are single pinnate, or rarely bipinnate); and from Botrypus in being evergreen, or at least winter-green (Botrypus are deciduous) and having the non-spore-bearing part of the frond long-stalked (short-stalked in Botrypus).

## Care Guide
The Leathery Grapefern thrives in partial sun and moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry slightly between sessions. Fertilize sparingly during active growth to mimic its native temperate woodland and grassland conditions, where it adapts to varying moisture and light levels.

### Fertilizer
Light to infrequent fertilization; a diluted balanced liquid fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season.
