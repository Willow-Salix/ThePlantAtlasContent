## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern United States |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie and Open Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and flowering, tolerates some partial sun. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Water regularly to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during establishment. Established plants are quite drought-tolerant; allow the top few inches of soil to dry out between waterings. |

## Introduction
Helianthus () is a genus comprising around 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the daisy family Asteraceae commonly known as sunflowers. Except for three South American species, the species of Helianthus are native to North America and Central America. The best-known species is the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus). This and other species, notably Jerusalem artichoke (H. tuberosus), are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions, as food crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants. The species H. annuus typically grows during the summer and into early fall, with the peak growth season being mid-summer.
Several perennial Helianthus species are grown in gardens, but have a tendency to spread rapidly and can become aggressive.  On the other hand, the whorled sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus, was listed as an endangered species in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule protecting it under the Endangered Species Act. The primary threats to this species are industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. They grow to 1.8 metres (6 feet) and are primarily found in woodlands, adjacent to creeks and moist, prairie-like areas.
The common sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine, cultivated there for several centuries.

## Care Guide
This native perennial sunflower flourishes in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its temperate grassland and open woodland origins. It needs moderate watering, particularly when young, becoming resilient to drought once established. Fertilization requirements are minimal, as it adapts well to average soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant generally thrives in average soils and does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring may be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary in fertile garden soil.
