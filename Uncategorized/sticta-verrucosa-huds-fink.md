## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate, oceanic regions, particularly Western Europe (e.g., British Isles, Atlantic France, Portugal), Pacific Northwest of North America, and other similar high-humidity forested areas globally. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Oceanic Climate (characterized by high humidity, frequent rainfall, and mild temperatures). |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers partial to full shade, avoiding direct sunlight which can cause desiccation. Thrives in diffuse light conditions found beneath forest canopies. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires very high ambient humidity and consistent moisture from rain, fog, or dew. Does not absorb water through roots like vascular plants, relying entirely on atmospheric moisture. Regular misting or placement in a high-humidity environment is crucial for cultivation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sticta is a genus of lichens in the family Peltigeraceae. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in tropical areas, and includes about 114 species. These lichens have a leafy appearance, and are colored brown or black. Sticta species with cyanobacteria as photobionts can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, and due to their relative abundance and high turnover, they contribute appreciably to the rainforest ecosystem. They are commonly called spotted felt lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in environments with consistently high humidity and clean air, preferring partial to full shade. It absorbs moisture and trace nutrients directly from its environment, making traditional watering and fertilization irrelevant. Maintaining high atmospheric moisture is key.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain trace nutrients from rainwater and airborne particles. Requires clean air, as pollutants can be detrimental.
