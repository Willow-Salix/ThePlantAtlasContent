## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in consistently moist, humid conditions with very low light. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid direct sun and high nutrient levels, mimicking its native cool, shaded, and damp boreal or alpine habitats.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Bryophytes are adapted to nutrient-poor environments and are sensitive to high salt concentrations; if fertilized, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid solution very sparingly.
