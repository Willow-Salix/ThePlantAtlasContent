## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, including boreal regions of Labrador, Quebec, Newfoundland, and the northeastern United States. |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest, Subarctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light. It thrives in shaded or dappled light conditions, typical of a forest floor. Direct sunlight should be strictly avoided as it can quickly dry out and damage the moss. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture and high humidity to thrive. The substrate should be kept constantly damp but not waterlogged. Regular misting, a terrarium environment, or placement near a humidifier is essential to maintain ambient humidity levels. |

## Introduction
Brachythecium is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Brachytheciaceae. The genus was first described by Wilhelm Philippe Schimper.

## Care Guide
Brachythecium labradoricum thrives in cool, consistently moist, and high-humidity environments with low to medium indirect light, mirroring its native boreal habitat. Ensure the substrate remains damp and provide high ambient humidity through misting or terrarium conditions, while avoiding direct sun and strong fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to no fertilizer is needed. Mosses generally absorb nutrients from their environment (rainwater, decaying matter) and can be harmed by high concentrations of salts found in typical fertilizers. If desired, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied very sparingly, perhaps once or twice a year.
