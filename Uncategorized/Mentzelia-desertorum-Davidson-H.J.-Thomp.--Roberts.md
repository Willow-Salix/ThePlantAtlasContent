## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, making it highly drought-tolerant. Minimal to no fertilizer is needed, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor desert soils, emphasizing a 'neglect is best' approach to care.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; desert soils are typically poor. If needed, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once a year during its active growing period.
