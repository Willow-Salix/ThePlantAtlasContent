## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mountainous regions of eastern California (Inyo and Mono Counties) and southern Nevada (Clark County), USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Alpine to Subalpine Mountainous |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers full sun exposure, especially in cooler alpine environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate watering. Requires excellent drainage and prefers soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought tolerant once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Clokey's Paintbrush thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean, rocky soils, mimicking its native arid alpine and subalpine environments. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions and hemiparasitic nature.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky soils characteristic of its native habitat. As a hemiparasite, it obtains some nutrients from host plants.
