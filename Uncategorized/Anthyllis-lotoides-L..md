## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean region, including Southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of Western Asia |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; requires regular watering during its active growing season (cooler months) but is highly drought-tolerant in hot, dry summers. Well-draining soil is essential to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Anthyllis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. This genus contains both herbaceous and shrubby species and is distributed in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The most widespread and familiar species is A. vulneraria (kidney vetch), a familiar grassland flower which has also been introduced to New Zealand.
Anthyllis species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the following case-bearers of the genus Coleophora: C. acanthyllidis, C. protecta (both feed exclusively on A. tragacanthoides), C. hermanniella (feeds exclusively on A. hermanniae), C. vestalella (feeds exclusively on A. cytisoides) and C. vulnerariae (feeds exclusively on A. vulneraria).

## Care Guide
This Mediterranean plant thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage. Water moderately during its cooler growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and significantly reduce watering during hot summer dormancy. Its nitrogen-fixing capabilities mean it has low fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low; as a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen and generally thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils. Excessive fertilization is unnecessary.
