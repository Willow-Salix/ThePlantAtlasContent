## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Eastern Europe, extending into parts of Asia, found particularly in temperate wetland and riparian zones. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Wetland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, with full sun generally promoting the best root development and yield, similar to its open, sun-exposed native stream banks. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native marshy and stream-side habitats. Requires frequent and generous watering, and should not be allowed to dry out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sium sisarum, commonly known as skirret, is a perennial plant of the family Apiaceae sometimes grown as a root vegetable. The English name skirret is derived from the Middle English 'skirwhit' or 'skirwort', meaning 'white root'. In Scots it is known as crummock and in Irish as sciréad. Its Danish name sukkerrod, Dutch name suikerwortel and German name "Zuckerwurzel" translate as 'sugar root'.
Skirret has a cluster of bright white, sweetish, somewhat aromatic roots, each approximately 15–20 centimetres (6–8 in) in length. These are used as a vegetable in the same manner as the common salsify, black salsify and the parsnip.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Skirret thrives in temperate conditions, demanding full sun and perpetually moist to wet soil to replicate its native wetland environment. Consistent and abundant watering is crucial for its growth, complemented by moderately fertile, organic-rich soil to ensure healthy root development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from moderately fertile soil rich in organic matter. Incorporate well-rotted compost or a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer at planting or annually.
