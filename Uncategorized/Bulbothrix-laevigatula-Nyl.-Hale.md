| **Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Moist Forests and Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to bright indirect light, with tolerance for some dappled morning sun. Avoid harsh, direct afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity is crucial. Requires regular hydration from atmospheric moisture or misting, allowing for brief drying periods between applications. |

## Introduction
Bulbothrix is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. Established in 1974 by the American lichenologist Mason Hale as a segregate from the genus Parmelia, Bulbothrix comprises about 40 accepted species as of 2025. These foliose lichens are distinguished by their characteristic black, bulb-tipped hairs (cilia) along the lobe edges and are found roughly equally divided between the Old World and New World, growing predominantly on trees in lowland rainforests and shrublands.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in a high-humidity environment with moderate to bright indirect light, mimicking its tropical and subtropical native habitats. It requires frequent misting for hydration and relies on ambient nutrients, making traditional fertilization unnecessary and potentially detrimental.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization is required or recommended, as lichens derive nutrients from the air and rain. Chemical fertilizers can be harmful.
