## Introduction
Salvia () is the largest genus of plants in the sage family Lamiaceae, with just under 1,000 species of shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and annuals. Within the Lamiaceae, Salvia is part of the tribe Mentheae within the subfamily Nepetoideae.  One of several genera commonly referred to as sage, it includes two widely used herbs, Salvia officinalis (common sage, or just "sage") and Salvia rosmarinus (rosemary, formerly Rosmarinus officinalis). 
The genus is distributed throughout the Old World and the Americas (over 900 total species), with three distinct regions of diversity: Central America and South America (approximately 600 species); Central Asia and the Mediterranean (250 species); Eastern Asia (90 species).

## Care Guide
Ziegler's Sage thrives in conditions mirroring its native Southern California chaparral habitat, requiring full sun and excellent drainage. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant. Avoid rich soils and heavy fertilization to ensure optimal growth and health.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to lean, poor soils and does not require frequent or heavy fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
