## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy fescue thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping or rocky gardens. It requires moderate watering, especially when establishing, but is quite drought-tolerant thereafter and needs minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low, as it is adapted to the naturally less fertile soils found in montane and subalpine regions.
