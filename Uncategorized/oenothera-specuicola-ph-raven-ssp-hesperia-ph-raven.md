## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert native thrives in full sun and requires very little water, preferring dry soil between infrequent, deep waterings. Fertilization is rarely needed, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny gardens with well-draining soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal; generally not required in cultivation. If growth appears very sluggish in extremely poor soil, a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year in spring.
