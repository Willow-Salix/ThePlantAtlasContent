## Introduction
Equisetum (; horsetail) is the only living genus in Equisetaceae, a family of vascular plants that reproduce by spores rather than seeds.
Equisetum is a "living fossil", the only living genus of the entire subclass Equisetidae, which for over 100 million years was much more diverse and dominated the understorey of late Paleozoic forests. Some equisetids were large trees reaching to 30 m (98 ft) tall. The genus Calamites of the family Calamitaceae, for example, is abundant in coal deposits from the Carboniferous period. The pattern of spacing of nodes in horsetails, wherein those toward the apex of the shoot are increasingly close together, is said to have inspired John Napier to invent logarithms. Modern horsetails first appeared during the Jurassic period.
A superficially similar but entirely unrelated flowering plant genus, mare's tail (Hippuris), is occasionally referred to as "horsetail", and adding to confusion, the name "mare's tail" is sometimes applied to Equisetum.

## Care Guide
This vigorous plant thrives in consistently wet to moist conditions, making it ideal for pond margins or bog gardens. It tolerates a wide range of light, from full sun to partial shade, and benefits from occasional light fertilization to support its robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer. A balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season (spring/summer).
