## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere; widely cultivated, derived from species native to Asia and Europe. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Continental |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) is essential for vigorous growth and best form. |
| **Watering** | High; prefers consistently moist to wet soil and is intolerant of drought. Thrives in riparian zones or areas with abundant water availability. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
The Wisconsin Weeping Willow thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil, typical of its preference for riparian environments in temperate zones. This fast-growing hybrid benefits from regular watering and moderate fertilization to support its vigorous development. Ensure ample space and moisture for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high; benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, especially in poor soils or to encourage its characteristic rapid growth.
