## Care Guide
This hardy wild rose is well-suited to full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native temperate grasslands. It requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods, but is largely self-sufficient with minimal fertilization once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; generally thrives on natural soil fertility. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can support robust growth but is not always essential.
