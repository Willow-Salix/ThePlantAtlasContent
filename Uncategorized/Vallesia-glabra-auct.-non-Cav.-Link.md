## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical Americas, including Mexico, Central America, Caribbean islands, and much of South America (e.g., Brazil, Peru, Ecuador). |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest, Subtropical Dry Forest, or coastal scrub; characterized by warm temperatures year-round with distinct wet and dry seasons. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. It thrives with ample light, mimicking its natural habitat in open areas, forest edges, and thickets. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the active growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. Reduce watering significantly during cooler, dormant periods. |

## Care Guide
Provide this plant with full sun to partial shade and ensure well-draining soil. Water regularly during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and reduce watering in cooler months. Fertilize lightly once or twice a year during the growing season.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient. Apply a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season, as it tolerates poorer soils.
