## Care Guide
Parry's wormwood thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, typical of its alpine origins. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between applications to mimic its natural habitat. Avoid over-fertilization to maintain its health and characteristic growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils and does not require rich fertilization. Excessive fertilizer can be detrimental.
