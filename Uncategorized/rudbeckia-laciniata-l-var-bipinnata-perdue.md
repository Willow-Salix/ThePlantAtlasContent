## 🧤 Care Instructions
This robust perennial thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, fertile soil. Provide regular watering, especially when establishing and during dry spells, to mimic its native riparian habitat. Annual amendment with compost or a light spring fertilizer application will support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Prefers rich, organic soil. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or simply amend soil with compost annually.
