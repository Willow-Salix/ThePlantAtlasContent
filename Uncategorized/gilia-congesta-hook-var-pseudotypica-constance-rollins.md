## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, including parts of the United States (California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado) and Canada (British Columbia). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Semi-Arid Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open, exposed areas with high solar radiation. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. This plant is highly drought-tolerant, typical of arid environments with sporadic rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gilia is a genus of flowering plants in the Polemoniaceae family and is related to phlox. It includes 39 species native to the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, and to Ohio, in North America, and from Ecuador and Peru to southern Chile and Argentina in South America. These Western native plants are best sown in sunny, well-draining soil in the temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, where they occur mainly in desert or semi-desert habitats 
They are summer annuals, rarely perennials, growing to 10–120 cm tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, usually pinnate (rarely simple), forming a basal rosette in most species. The flowers are produced in a panicle, with a five-lobed corolla, which can be blue, white, pink or yellow.
Gilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia aurantiaca and Schinia biundulata (the latter feeds exclusively on G. cana).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native arid scrubland environment, requiring full sun exposure and minimal watering once established. It is highly drought-tolerant and performs best in well-draining, nutrient-poor soil with very infrequent fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its native scrubland and grassland habitats, suggesting it is not a heavy feeder.
