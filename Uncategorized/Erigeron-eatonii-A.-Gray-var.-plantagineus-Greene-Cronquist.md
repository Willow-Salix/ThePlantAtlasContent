## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains and other ranges), including states like Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Idaho, Montana, and parts of California and Oregon, often extending into Canadian provinces. |
| **Climate** | Subalpine to Alpine Meadow/Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun. Thrives in open, exposed areas with direct sunlight for most of the day, typical of high-elevation meadows above the tree line or in forest clearings. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist, but well-drained soil during the growing season, mimicking snowmelt and seasonal rainfall. Tolerates short periods of drought once established, but avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Erigeron () is a large genus of plants in the composite family (Asteraceae). It is placed in the tribe Astereae and is closely related to the Old World asters (Aster) and the true daisies (Bellis). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and the highest diversity occurs in North America.

## Care Guide
Eaton's Fleabane thrives in conditions reminiscent of its native Western North American subalpine meadows, requiring full to partial sun and well-drained soil. Provide moderate, consistent watering during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications. It needs minimal fertilizer, adapting well to naturally lean and rocky substrates.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer. Naturally grows in lean, rocky, or average soil conditions. Over-fertilizing can lead to leggy growth. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring, or none at all if soil is adequate, is sufficient.
