## Introduction
Populus is a genus of 25–30 species of deciduous flowering plants in the family Salicaceae, native to most of the Northern Hemisphere. English names variously applied to different species include poplar (), aspen, and cottonwood.
The western balsam poplar (P. trichocarpa) was the first tree to have its full DNA code determined by DNA sequencing, in 2006.

## Care Guide
This Golden Aspen thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its native temperate to subalpine mountain habitats. It is a relatively low-maintenance tree once established, benefiting from regular watering and minimal fertilization to achieve optimal health and its characteristic golden foliage.

### Fertilizer
Generally low-to-moderate nutrient needs. In average garden soil, little to no fertilization is required; if soil is poor, a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial.
