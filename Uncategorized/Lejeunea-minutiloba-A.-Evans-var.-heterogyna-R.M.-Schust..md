## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caribbean islands (e.g., Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico) and tropical Central/South America |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Extremely low to indirect light; avoid any direct sunlight. Prefers deep shade, mimicking its natural habitat under dense canopy or on the undersides of leaves. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high humidity and constant moisture. Keep substrate always moist but not waterlogged. Frequent misting or placement in a terrarium/paludarium is ideal to maintain high atmospheric humidity. |

## Introduction

The genus was circumscribed by Marie-Anne Libert in Ann. Gen. Sci. Phys. vol.6 on page 372 in 1820.

## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical rainforest origin: very high humidity, consistently moist substrate, and very low, indirect light. It is crucial to prevent drying out and provide excellent air circulation despite the high humidity to avoid fungal issues. Minimal to no fertilization is required.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. If fertilizing, use an extremely diluted liquid fertilizer (1/10th or less strength) very sparingly, perhaps once a month during active growth, primarily relying on nutrients from water and air.
