## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, including Southern Europe (e.g., Spain, Italy, Greece), North Africa (e.g., Morocco, Algeria), and parts of Western Asia (e.g., Turkey). |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters), characteristic of semi-arid shrublands and grasslands. |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure, typical of its open, unshaded native habitats in Mediterranean regions. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering, particularly during its active growing season. Avoid waterlogging, especially in summer, as it's adapted to dry conditions. |

## Introduction
Stipa is a genus of about 140 species of large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and  spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to Stipa, which have since been reclassified into new genera.
Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as Stipa brachytricha, S. arundinacea, S. splendens, S. gigantea and S. pulchra are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.
It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.

## Care Guide
Bearded Feather Grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering. Fertilizer needs are low, making it a low-maintenance ornamental grass.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; typically thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and does not require heavy feeding. An annual light application of balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial but is often not necessary.
