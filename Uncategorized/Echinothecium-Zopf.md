## Care Guide
This fungus thrives in warm, very humid conditions with indirect light, often growing on plants or other surfaces. Maintain high ambient moisture and ensure moderate light; it acquires nutrients from surface organic matter rather than soil fertilization.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization needed; obtains nutrients from organic exudates (e.g., honeydew) and surface detritus on host plants.
