## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central China (specifically Hubei and Sichuan provinces) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun for optimal growth and dense foliage; can tolerate light partial shade, especially when young. |
| **💧 Water** | Needs consistently moist, well-draining soil; thrives in conditions mimicking its native habitat near rivers and streams, and does not tolerate drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Metasequoia glyptostroboides, the dawn redwood, is a fast-growing, endangered deciduous conifer. It is the sole living species of the genus Metasequoia, one of three genera in the subfamily Sequoioideae of the family Cupressaceae. It now survives in the wild only in wet lower slopes and montane river and stream valleys in the border region of Hubei and Hunan provinces and Chongqing municipality in south-central China, notably in Lichuan county in Hubei. Although the shortest of the redwoods, it can grow to 167 ft (51 m) in height.

In 1941, the genus Metasequoia was reported by paleobotanist Shigeru Miki as a widely distributed extinct genus based on fossils, before attracting considerable attention a few years later when small populations were found alive in central China. It is a well-known example of a living fossil species. Modern dawn redwood appears identical to its late Cretaceous ancestors. The tree faces considerable risks of extinction in its wild range due to deforestation; however, it has been planted extensively in arboreta worldwide, where it has proved a popular and fast-growing ornamental plant. If the species had not been discovered when it was, it might have become extinct before being investigated.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Dawn Redwood thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its native humid subtropical river valley habitat. Ensure it receives ample water, especially during dry periods, and apply a balanced fertilizer annually to support its vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer application in spring, particularly in less fertile soils or for encouraging robust growth in young trees.
