## Introduction
Pseudognaphalium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as cudweeds or rabbit tobacco (P. obtusifolium is the original species with that name). They are widespread in tropical and temperate regions of many countries.
Species have been moved between Pseudognaphalium and the related genus Gnaphalium.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian endemic 'Ena'ena is a hardy plant adapted to dry, exposed coastal and volcanic areas, demanding full sun and well-drained soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing to best replicate its natural, lean growing conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to None. Thrives in nutrient-poor soils like lava flows; excessive fertilization can be detrimental. A very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer once a year, or none at all, is ideal.
