## Introduction
Dyssodia is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Many species formerly included in Dyssodia are now treated as members of other related genera, including Thymophylla or Adenophyllum. Dyssodia papposa is usually retained in this genus.  The name is derived from the Greek δυσοδια (dusodia), meaning "ill-smelling".
Several species of Dyssodia (sensu lato) have found their way into the nursery trade and are relatively popular flowering annuals for hot, dry sites.  Generally sold as threadleaf dyssodia (Dyssodia tenuisecta) and golden dyssodia (Dyssodia cf. pentachaeta).  They perform best in well-drained soil.

## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full sun and requires very little water, preferring long dry periods between deep waterings. It is low-maintenance regarding nutrients, adapting well to lean, rocky soils with minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to poor soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, during the growing season with a balanced, diluted fertilizer.
