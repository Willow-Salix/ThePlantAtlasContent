## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring very little water, mimicking its arid natural habitat. Avoid overwatering and rich, heavily fertilized soils to ensure its optimal health and drought tolerance.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant thrives in poor, lean, sandy, or gravelly soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
