## 🧤 Care Instructions
Laurera lichens thrive in high humidity and consistent moisture, preferring partial shade to dappled light. They require no fertilization, obtaining nutrients naturally from their environment. Mimic their native tropical and subtropical forest conditions for successful growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from their environment (air, rain, substrate) and can be harmed by artificial fertilization.
