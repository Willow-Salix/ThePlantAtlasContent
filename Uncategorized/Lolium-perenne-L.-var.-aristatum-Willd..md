## Care Guide
Perennial Ryegrass thrives in full sun with consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its native temperate grassland habitat. It requires regular watering and benefits from nitrogen-rich fertilization to maintain vigorous growth, especially during its active season.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate to high fertility. Apply a balanced, nitrogen-rich fertilizer periodically during active growth to encourage lush foliage.
