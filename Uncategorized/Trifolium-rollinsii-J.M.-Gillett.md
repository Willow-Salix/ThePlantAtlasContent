## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern California, USA (endemic to the Transverse Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters), found in chaparral, open woodlands, and meadows. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, reflecting its natural habitat in open fields and forest clearings. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growth period, typically in cooler, wetter months. It is tolerant of dry periods once established, but benefits from occasional deep watering during extended dry spells in cultivation. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings. |

## Introduction
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## Care Guide
Rollins' Clover thrives in full to partial sun, mimicking its native open habitats in Southern California's Mediterranean climate. It requires moderate watering during its active growth, tolerating dry periods once established. As a nitrogen fixer, it needs minimal to no fertilizer, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements. As a legume, it is a nitrogen fixer and can thrive in average to poor soils. If growth appears stunted, a low-nitrogen, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly, once a year in spring.
