| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra and Subalpine zones, characterized by cold winters, short growing seasons, high solar radiation, and well-drained, often rocky soils. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers high light exposure typical of alpine environments with little tree cover. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during active growth, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Requires excellent drainage and is drought-tolerant once established. |

## Care Guide
This alpine native thrives in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its natural mountainous habitat. It requires infrequent watering once established, tolerating drought conditions, and should not be over-fertilized. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer requirements. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils.
