## Care Guide
This rockcress thrives in cool, mountainous conditions with ample sunlight and well-drained soil. Provide consistent moisture during its active growth but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. It generally requires minimal fertilization, reflecting its adaptation to naturally lean environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; naturally found in lean to average, well-drained soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release formula in spring.
