## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (including parts of the United States and Canada), often in saline environments such as salt flats and playas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Saline Habitats, characterized by saline or alkaline soils within semi-arid to temperate regions. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, as it typically grows in open, exposed saline environments without canopy cover. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out significantly between waterings. It is adapted to fluctuating moisture conditions and tolerates periods of dryness typical of its saline native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Chenopodium is a genus of numerous species of perennial or annual herbaceous flowering plants known as the goosefoot, which occur almost anywhere in the world. It is placed in the family Amaranthaceae in the APG II system; older classification systems, notably the widely used Cronquist system, separate it and its relatives as Chenopodiaceae, but this leaves the rest of the Amaranthaceae polyphyletic. However, among the Amaranthaceae, the genus Chenopodium is the namesake member of the subfamily Chenopodioideae.
