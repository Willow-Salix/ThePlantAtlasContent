## Introduction
Berberis (), commonly known as barberry, is a large genus of deciduous and evergreen shrubs from 1–5 m (3+1⁄2–16+1⁄2 ft) tall, found throughout temperate and subtropical regions of the world (apart from Australia). Species diversity is greatest in South America and Asia, but native species also appear in Europe, Africa and North America. 
The best-known Berberis species is the type species, B. vulgaris (European barberry), which is common in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and central Asia; it has also been widely introduced in North America. Additionally, B. aquifolium is the state flower of Oregon.

## Care Guide
Sonne's Barberry thrives in sunny to partly shaded locations with well-drained, lean soil, mimicking its native rocky slopes. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering, especially during dry summer periods, and benefits from minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soils. Fertilize sparingly if at all.
