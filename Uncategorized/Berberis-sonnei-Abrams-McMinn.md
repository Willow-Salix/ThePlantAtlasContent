## 🌱 Overview
Berberis (), commonly known as barberry, is a large genus of deciduous and evergreen shrubs from 1–5 m (3+1⁄2–16+1⁄2 ft) tall, found throughout temperate and subtropical regions of the world (apart from Australia). Species diversity is greatest in South America and Asia, but native species also appear in Europe, Africa and North America.
