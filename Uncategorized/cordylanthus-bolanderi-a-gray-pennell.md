## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Northern California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Arid Scrubland/Chaparral/Oak Woodland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, reflecting its growth in open chaparral, grasslands, and woodland edges. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the cooler, active growing season (late winter to spring), followed by significantly reduced or no watering during the hot, dry summer months to simulate native drought conditions. Requires excellent drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cordylanthus (lit. 'club-flower'), commonly known as bird's beaks, is a genus of parasitic plants in the broomrape family, Orobanchaceae. These western North American natives are sparse, weedy-looking annuals with long branching erect stems and little foliage, and many bear bird's-beak–shaped flowers. They are remarkable among the broomrapes for growing at searing temperatures in arid climates.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full to partial sun and requires well-drained soil. Mimic its native Mediterranean climate by providing water during its active growth in the cooler months, followed by a dry period in summer. Due to its hemiparasitic nature, only light fertilization is typically needed.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a hemiparasitic plant, it derives some nutrients from host plants. Native soils in chaparral and grasslands are not typically overly rich, so heavy fertilization is not necessary and may be detrimental.
