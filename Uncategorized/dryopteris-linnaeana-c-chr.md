## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Circumboreal; extensively across North America (Alaska, Canada, Northern US), Europe, and Northern Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Boreal Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade; direct sun will scorch its delicate fronds as it naturally grows in the understory of dense forests. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture, keeping the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged, replicating the damp forest floor conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Gymnocarpium is a small genus of ferns, called oak ferns. It was once placed with various other groups, including the dryopteroid ferns and the athyrioid ferns.  Cladistic analysis has demonstrated that Gymnocarpium and Cystopteris form a natural but relatively primitive clade that is basal to the asplenioid, thelypterioid, and athyrioid ferns comprehensively.
Gymnocarpium sori are small, round and naked.  These ferns generally have a slender, creeping rhizome under the surface of the ground, and fairly thin-textured fronds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Oak Fern thrives in cool, shady environments, needing consistently moist yet well-drained soil to mimic its native forest habitat. Protect it from direct sun and avoid letting the soil dry out completely or become waterlogged. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted solution during its active growth phase.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient; a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer (half-strength) can be applied once or twice during the growing season.
