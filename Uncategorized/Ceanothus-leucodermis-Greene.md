## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California (USA) and northern Baja California (Mexico) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland / Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely drought-tolerant once established. Requires very infrequent watering, typically only during prolonged dry periods in summer, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ceanothus is a genus of about 50–60 species of nitrogen-fixing shrubs and small trees in the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae). Common names for members of this genus are buckbrush, California lilac, soap bush, or just ceanothus. "Ceanothus" comes from Ancient Greek: κεάνωθος (keánōthos), which was applied by Theophrastus (371–287 BC) to an Old World plant believed to be Cirsium arvense.
The genus is native to North America with the highest diversity on the western coast. Some species (e.g., C. americanus) are restricted to the eastern United States and southeast Canada, and others (e.g., C. caeruleus) extend as far south as Guatemala. Most are shrubs 0.5–3 metres (1.6–9.8 ft) tall, but C. arboreus and C. thyrsiflorus, both native to California, can be small multi-trunked trees up to 6–7 metres (20–23 ft) tall.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Chaparral Whitethorn thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, suited to lean, well-draining soils without the need for frequent watering or fertilization. Emphasize minimal intervention, allowing it to adapt to dry conditions and avoid overwatering or excessive nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. As a nitrogen-fixing plant, it thrives in lean soils and does not require supplemental nitrogen. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
