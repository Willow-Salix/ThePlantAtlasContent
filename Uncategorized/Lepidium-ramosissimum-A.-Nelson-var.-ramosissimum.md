## Introduction
Lepidium is a genus of plants in the mustard/cabbage family, Brassicaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. It includes familiar species such as garden cress, maca, and dittander. General common names include peppercress, peppergrass, pepperweed, and pepperwort.  Some species form tumbleweeds.
The genus name Lepidium is from Greek meaning 'small scale', which is thought to be derived from a folk medicine usage of the plant to treat leprosy, which cause small scales on the skin. Another meaning is related to the small scale-like fruit.

## Care Guide
Manybranched Pepperweed thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, mirroring its native semi-arid grasslands. It requires minimal watering once established due to its excellent drought tolerance. Fertilization needs are low, adapting well to moderate to poor soil fertility.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; it adapts well to poor to moderately fertile soils. Excessive fertilization is generally unnecessary.
