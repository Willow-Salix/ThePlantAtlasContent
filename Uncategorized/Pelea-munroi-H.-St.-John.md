## Care Guide
This rare Hawaiian plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native subtropical wet forest habitat, requiring consistent moisture and protection from direct, intense sunlight. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot while maintaining high ambient humidity. Provide light fertilization during periods of active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer), as forest soils are generally not excessively rich.
