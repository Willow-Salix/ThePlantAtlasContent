## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Subarctic and alpine regions of North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Rocky Mountains) and Eurasia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Subarctic, Boreal Forest margins |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, ideally with several hours of direct sunlight daily due to its open native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist soil, especially during the growing season, mimicking snowmelt and rain patterns in its native habitat. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This cold-hardy willow thrives in full to partial sun with consistently moist, well-drained soil. It tolerates cold temperatures and requires minimal fertilization, making it suitable for cool-climate gardens or containers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is usually sufficient, as alpine and boreal soils are often nutrient-lean.
