## Care Guide
The Hala Tree (Pandanus tectorius var. menziesii) is a resilient tropical coastal plant thriving in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is quite adaptable, tolerating some drought once established and requiring only minimal fertilization. Its care strategy focuses on replicating its warm, humid, and well-lit native environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season, particularly in nutrient-poor sandy soils.
