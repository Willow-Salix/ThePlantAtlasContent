## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern United States (Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana) and northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Warm Temperate Grassland/Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6-8+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water moderately but deeply when the top few inches of soil are dry, allowing it to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Texas Indigo is a resilient, drought-tolerant plant best suited for full sun exposure and lean, well-draining soils, reflecting its native semi-arid grassland environment. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and avoid heavy fertilization due to its natural nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low; this plant thrives in lean, well-drained soils and, as a legume, fixes its own nitrogen. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is optional, or none at all.
