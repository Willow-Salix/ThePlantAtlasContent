## 🌱 Overview
Armeria is a genus of flowering plants.  These plants are sometimes known as "lady's cushion", "thrift", or "sea pink" (the latter because as they are often found on coastlines).  The genus counts over a hundred species, mostly native to the Mediterranean, although Armeria maritima is an exception, being distributed along the coasts of the Northern Hemisphere, including Ireland, parts of the United Kingdom such as Cornwall, and the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park in Wales.
Some are popular with gardeners as rockery plants.
During the Second World War, the UK "thruppenny bit" coin (3 old pence), which had featured a portcullis on its reverse side, changed to a depiction of the thrift plant, as a means of reminding the population of the need to avoid waste and practise thrift.  After the war, it reverted to the portcullis

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Armeria pungens, or Large Thrift, thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean coastal environment. It requires minimal water once established, tolerating drought conditions well. Fertilization is generally not necessary, as it is adapted to poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Over-fertilization can harm the plant.
