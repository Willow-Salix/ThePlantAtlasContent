## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its native desert environment with minimal canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Mimics the infrequent rainfall patterns of its native desert climate. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
The California Evening Primrose is a resilient desert native perfectly suited for arid conditions. It flourishes in full sun with well-drained, lean soils, requiring very little water and no supplemental fertilization once established.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; thrives in poor to average soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental, as its native desert soils are generally nutrient-poor.
