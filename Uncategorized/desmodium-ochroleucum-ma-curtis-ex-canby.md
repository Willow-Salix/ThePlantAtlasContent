## 🧤 Care Instructions
Native to the humid subtropical woodlands of the southeastern US, Cream Ticktrefoil thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires regular watering in well-draining soil, with minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes nitrogen, so high-nitrogen fertilizers should be avoided. A balanced, low-nitrogen or organic compost applied sparingly is sufficient.
