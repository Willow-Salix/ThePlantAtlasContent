## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Cosmopolitan, particularly widespread across temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in human-modified environments. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate and Boreal forests, woodlands, and urban areas; adaptable to a range of atmospheric conditions including those with some air pollution. |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light to partial sun; tolerant of some direct exposure, especially when moist, but can desiccate rapidly in intense, dry conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies entirely on atmospheric moisture (rain, dew, high humidity); capable of surviving long periods of desiccation, rehydrating quickly upon contact with water. |

## 🌱 Overview
Candelariella is a genus of bright yellow, ocher, or greenish yellow crustose or squamulose lichens in the family Candelariaceae. Members of the genus are commonly called eggyolk lichens, goldspeck lichens, or yolk lichens.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Candelariella Lichen thrives with bright, indirect light and high atmospheric humidity or frequent exposure to rain. It requires no soil watering or traditional fertilization, instead absorbing all necessary moisture and nutrients from the air. This lichen tolerates periods of desiccation and rapidly rehydrates when moisture is available.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Nutrients are absorbed from atmospheric deposition (e.g., dust, dissolved compounds in precipitation); often found on nutrient-enriched substrates.
