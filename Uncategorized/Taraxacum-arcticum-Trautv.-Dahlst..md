## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic regions of North America, Greenland, Europe, and Asia (circumpolar) |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, preferring bright light with cooler temperatures, similar to long summer days at high latitudes. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist during the growing season, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot, as tundra soils can be damp but not waterlogged. |

## Introduction
Taraxacum () is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, which consists of species commonly known as dandelions. The scientific and hobby study of the genus is known as taraxacology. The genus has a near-cosmopolitan distribution, absent only from tropical and polar areas. Two of the most common species worldwide, T. officinale (the common dandelion) and T. erythrospermum (the red-seeded dandelion), are European species introduced into North America, where they are non-native. Dandelions thrive in temperate regions and can be found in yards, gardens, sides of roads, among crops, and in many other habitats.
Like other members of the family Asteraceae, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is called a floret. In part due to their abundance, along with being a generalist species, dandelions are one of the most vital early spring nectar sources for a wide host of pollinators. Many Taraxacum species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in cool, bright conditions characteristic of its arctic tundra home. Provide consistent moisture during its active growing period, coupled with excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, it requires only minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements, as native tundra soils are typically poor in nutrients. A light application of a balanced fertilizer once early in the growing season is sufficient.
