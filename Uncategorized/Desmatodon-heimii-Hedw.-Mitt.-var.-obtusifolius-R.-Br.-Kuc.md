# Heim's Pottia Moss

*Desmatodon heimii (Hedw.) Mitt. var. obtusifolius (R. Br.) Kuc* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Antarctic regions, including Greenland, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Alaska, Siberia, Svalbard, and parts of the Antarctic Peninsula. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra, Polar Desert, Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in exposed, high-light environments, growing low to the ground without canopy shade. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering, allowing the substrate to dry out significantly between waterings. Highly tolerant of dry periods and desiccation. |

## Introduction
Desmatodon is an extinct genus of diadectid reptiliomorph. With fossils found from the Kasimovian (Missourian) stage of the Late Carboniferous of Pennsylvania, Colorado, and New Mexico in the United States, Desmatodon is the oldest known diadectid, the group of the first known herbivorous tetrapods. Later members obtained larger sizes, with Desmatodon being somewhat smaller, though its actual size is unknown due to the fragmentary nature of the fossils. Two species are currently recognized: the type species D. hollandi and the species D. hesperis.

## Care Guide
Heim's Pottia Moss thrives in cool, exposed conditions with full to partial sun. It requires infrequent watering, tolerating significant dry periods, and has very low nutrient needs, making it suitable for low-maintenance, harsh environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Native soils are nutrient-poor, and this moss is adapted to minimal nutrient availability. Over-fertilization can be harmful.
