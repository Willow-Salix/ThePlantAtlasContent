## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Lihau Island, Hawaii, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Dry Shrubland / Coastal Cliff |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring direct, unfiltered light for most of the day due to its exposed native habitat on cliffs and in dry shrubland. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, mirroring its adaptation to periods of low rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This critically endangered Hawaiian plant requires full sun and excellent drainage, thriving in conditions mimicking its native dry shrubland and cliff habitat. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to thoroughly dry between applications, and use fertilizer very sparingly, if at all.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Its native environment suggests adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, so a very dilute, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly during active growth, if any, is sufficient.
