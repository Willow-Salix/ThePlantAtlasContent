## Introduction
Bupleurum is a large genus of annual or perennial herbs or woody shrubs, with about 190 species, belonging to the family Apiaceae. The full size of its species may vary between a few cm to up to 3 m high. Their compound umbels of small flowers are adorned with bracteoles that are sometimes large and may play a role in attracting pollinators. Rare among the Apiaceae are the simple leaves, bracts (if present), and bracteoles. The genus is almost exclusively native in the Old World Northern Hemisphere, with one species native to North America and one species native to southern Africa.

## Care Guide
American Thorow-wax thrives in full to partial sun, requiring well-drained soil that mimics its native montane habitats. It is drought-tolerant once established and prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. Minimal to no fertilization is needed.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically no fertilization is needed in average soil, or a very light, balanced application once per growing season if soil is poor.
