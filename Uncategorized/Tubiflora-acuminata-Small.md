| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia, including India (Assam), Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia (Peninsular), Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Borneo), and the Philippines. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers low to medium indirect light. As an understory plant in its native habitat, it should be protected from direct, harsh sunlight, especially during the afternoon. |

## Care Guide
This tropical plant thrives in consistently moist, well-drained soil and low to medium indirect light, characteristic of its rainforest understory origin. Ensure high humidity and provide regular, diluted fertilization during its growth period for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate feeding during its active growing season (spring and summer). Use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-4 weeks.
