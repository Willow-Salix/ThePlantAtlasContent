## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in harsh, exposed conditions. Provide high light and very infrequent direct water, mimicking its arid native environment. It is sensitive to excess moisture and nutrients, so avoid fertilization and ensure good air circulation.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens are highly sensitive to external nutrients and do not require fertilization; excess can be detrimental.
