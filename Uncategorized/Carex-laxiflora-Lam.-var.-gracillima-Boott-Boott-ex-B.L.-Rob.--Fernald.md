## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in consistently moist to wet, humus-rich soil and prefers partial shade to dappled sun. Regular and ample watering is crucial to mimic its native habitat in moist woodlands. A moderate application of balanced fertilizer in spring supports vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially in poorer soils. Thrives in humus-rich soil.
