## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Northern Sierra Nevada foothills and North Coast Ranges, California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean, specifically found in seasonally wet meadows and vernal pools within foothill woodlands and chaparral biomes. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring ample light during its active growing period. |
| **💧 Water** | High during the growing season (winter-spring), requiring consistently moist to wet soil. Tolerates drying out in summer as it is an annual that dies back after seed set. |

## 🌱 Overview
Limnanthes, the type genus of the family Limnanthaceae, consists of annual herbaceous plants commonly known as the meadowfoams. The seven species are all native to coastal and adjoining regions (inland valleys, foothills and mountains) of western North America, where they typically grow in marshy habitats, such as the margins of vernal pools. Some are endemic to California.
General form ranges from decumbent to erect, with leaves either pinnately lobed or compound; the lobes or leaflets may themselves range from entire to deeply lobed. Both 4- and 5-sepaled and petaled members are known.
The white meadowfoam Limnanthes alba is of commercial interest for its oil, while several other species are rare or endangered. Honey produced by bees that pollinate Limnanthes alba has the distinct flavor of toasted marshmallows.
L. douglasii is widely cultivated as a hardy annual, its white and yellow flower colour giving it the common name of poached egg plant.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mountain Meadowfoam thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist to wet soil during its winter and spring growing season, mimicking its native vernal pool habitats. Fertilization should be light, as it's adapted to less rich, native soils. As an annual, it completes its life cycle by summer and tolerates dry conditions after setting seeds.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant is adapted to native soil conditions, which are often not overly rich. A light, balanced fertilizer can be used if soil is poor, but heavy feeding is generally not necessary.
