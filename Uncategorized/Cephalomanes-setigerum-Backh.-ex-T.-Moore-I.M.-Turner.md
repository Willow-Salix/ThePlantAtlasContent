| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia and Oceania, including Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo, Philippines, New Guinea. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light to deep shade; absolutely no direct sunlight as it can scorch the delicate fronds. |

## Care Guide
As a delicate filmy fern native to the understory of tropical rainforests, Cephalomanes setigerum demands consistently moist conditions and extremely high humidity. It thrives in very low, indirect light and should never be exposed to direct sunlight, with fertilization kept to a minimal and diluted regime during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization, if any. Use a very weak, diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/8 strength) once a month during the active growing season.
