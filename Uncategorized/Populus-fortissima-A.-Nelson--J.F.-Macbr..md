## Introduction
Populus is a genus of 25–30 species of deciduous flowering plants in the family Salicaceae, native to most of the Northern Hemisphere. English names variously applied to different species include poplar (), aspen, and cottonwood.
The western balsam poplar (P. trichocarpa) was the first tree to have its full DNA code determined by DNA sequencing, in 2006.

## Care Guide
Lanceleaf Cottonwood thrives in full sun with abundant water, mimicking its natural riverbank habitat. Ensure consistently moist, well-draining soil and provide moderate fertilization to support its robust and rapid growth, especially when young.

### Fertilizer
