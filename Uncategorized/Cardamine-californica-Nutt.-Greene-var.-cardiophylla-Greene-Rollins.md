## Introduction
A milkmaid, milk maid, milkwoman, dairymaid, or dairywoman is a girl or woman who works with milk or cows.  She milks cows and may prepare dairy products such as cream, butter, and cheese. The term milkmaid is not the female equivalent of milkman in the sense of one who delivers milk to the consumer;  it is the female equivalent of milkman in the sense of cowman or dairyman. 
In 1600s-1800s, English milkmaids sold milk wearing a yoke supporting two milk pails and vending vessels, and also decorated themselves for the London May Day procession.

Milkmaids flourish in cool, shaded conditions mimicking their native woodland understory. Provide consistent soil moisture, especially from late winter to spring, and protect from intense direct sunlight. This plant generally prefers organically rich soil and has low to moderate fertilizer needs.
