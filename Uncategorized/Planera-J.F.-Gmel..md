## Introduction
Planera aquatica, the planertree or water elm, is a species of flowering plant. Found in the southeastern United States, it is a small deciduous tree 10–15 m tall, closely related to the elms but with a softly, prickly nut 10–15 mm diameter, instead of a winged seed. It grows, as the name suggests, on wet sites. Despite its common English name, this species is not a true elm, although it is a close relative of the elms (species of the genus Ulmus). It is also subject to Dutch elm disease, a disease which affects only members of the Ulmaceae. It is native to most of the southeast United States. It is hardy down to Zone 7.

## Care Guide
Planertrees are best suited for boggy or wet areas, requiring consistently moist to saturated soil and tolerating standing water. They prefer full sun to partial shade and will flourish in rich, fertile soils, making them ideal for wetland or waterside plantings.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; thrives in average to rich, fertile soil typical of floodplains
