| **Climate** | Arctic and Alpine Wetlands, including fens and bogs |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun; avoid intense, scorching direct sun, especially in warmer conditions. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet; the substrate should never be allowed to dry out, mimicking its natural habitat in water-saturated fens and bogs. |

## Care Guide
This cold-hardy moss needs a constantly wet substrate and bright, indirect light to thrive. It is adapted to nutrient-poor or moderately rich conditions, so minimal fertilization is required. Avoid dry conditions and intense heat to ensure its survival.

### Fertilizer
Very minimal; a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly (e.g., once or twice a year) or not at all, as it is adapted to nutrient-limited environments.
