## 🌱 Overview
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Texas Saxifrage thrives in cool, moist, and shady environments, preferring well-drained, humus-rich soil. Provide consistent moisture and protect it from direct, harsh sunlight, especially during the hottest parts of the day. Fertilize sparingly to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring to early summer), or incorporate organic matter into the soil annually.
