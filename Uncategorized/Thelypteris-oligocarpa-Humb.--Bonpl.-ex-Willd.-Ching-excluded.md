## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America (e.g., Brazil, Peru, Costa Rica, Ecuador) and the Caribbean. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; protect from direct sunlight to prevent leaf scorch, as it typically grows in the shaded understory. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Requires high ambient humidity, mimicking its native wet forest environment. |

## Introduction
Thelypteris (maiden ferns) is a genus of ferns in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, family Thelypteridaceae, order Polypodiales. Two radically different circumscriptions of the genus are in use as of January 2020. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the genus is a very small one with about two species. In other approaches, the genus is the only one in the subfamily Thelypteridoideae, and so includes between 875 and 1083 species.
The genus name is from Greek thēlys "female" and pteris "fern". However, "female fern" usually refers to the common lady-fern.

## Care Guide
This tropical fern thrives in conditions that mimic its native rainforest habitat, demanding high humidity and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide low to medium indirect light, avoiding direct sun exposure, and fertilize lightly during periods of active growth.

### Fertilizer
Apply a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly during the active growing season (spring and summer), typically at half strength once a month.
