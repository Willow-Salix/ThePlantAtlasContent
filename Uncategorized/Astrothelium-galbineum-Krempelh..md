## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South America (e.g., Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru) and Central America |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect to low light; it typically thrives in the dappled shade found beneath dense forest canopies, avoiding direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | High humidity is essential; requires consistent moisture from atmospheric humidity and rainfall, frequent misting or a very humid environment is crucial for survival. |

## Introduction
Astrothelium is a large genus of corticolous (bark-dwelling) lichens in the family Trypetheliaceae. The genus is characterized by a corticate thallus and diverse ascomata structures, which can be simple, aggregated, or forming pseudostromata. Astrothelium is also notable for the carbonized walls of its ascomata, the so-called textura intricata (i.e., tightly interwoven) arrangement of cells in these walls, and various forms of distoseptate, transparent spores.

## Care Guide
This Astrothelium lichen requires a high humidity environment, mimicking its tropical rainforest origin. Provide indirect or low light exposure and ensure consistent atmospheric moisture through frequent misting or placement in a humid terrarium. Conventional fertilizers should be avoided as they are not beneficial and can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens obtain necessary nutrients directly from the air and rainwater, making conventional fertilizers unnecessary and potentially harmful.
