## Introduction
Coryphantha (from Greek, "flowering on the top"), or beehive cactus, is a genus of small to middle-sized, globose or columnar cacti. The genus is native to arid parts of Central America, Mexico, through Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas and north into southwestern, central, and southeastern Montana. With its two subgenera, 57 species and 20 subspecies, it is one of the largest genera of cactus.

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in high light conditions, ideally full sun, mirroring its native arid scrubland habitat. It requires infrequent, thorough watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions to prevent rot. Fertilize sparingly with a cactus-specific formula during its active growth phase.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a low-nitrogen cactus-specific fertilizer during the active growing season (spring to summer), once a month or every other month.
