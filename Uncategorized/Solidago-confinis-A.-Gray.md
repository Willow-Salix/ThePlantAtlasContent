## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
Pinewoods Goldenrod thrives in conditions mimicking its native Southern California and Baja California Mediterranean shrubland habitat. It requires full to partial sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing minimal watering. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it prefers lean to moderately fertile soils.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally not required. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils found in its native habitat and excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
