## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, Texas) and Northern Mexico (Sonora, Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) to ensure robust growth and flowering, as it originates from open desert environments. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal water once established, mimicking desert rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Phaulothamnus is a genus of plants formerly included in the family Phytolaccaceae but now considered a part of the Achatocarpaceae.
Only one species is recognized: Phaulothamnus spinescens A. Gray, native to southern Texas, northeastern Mexico (eastern Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas), and northwestern Mexico (Sonora, Sinaloa, Baja California, Baja California Sur and the Islas Marías of Nayarit). This is a branching shrub with juicy berries. Common names include snake-eyes, devilqueen,  or putia.
Phaulothamnus spinescens is a branching shrub up to 250 cm tall, with spines along the branches. Leaves are broader than wide, up to 35 mm wide but rarely more than 12 mm long. Flowers are borne one at a time or in racemes. Fruits are spherical, juicy, white to greenish with the black seeds visible through the thin fruit wall.

## Care Guide
Phaulothamnus is a highly drought-tolerant desert shrub that thrives in full sun. It requires minimal watering, allowing the soil to completely dry out between sessions, and generally needs little to no fertilization. Mimicking its arid native climate is key to its successful cultivation.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils, so fertilization is rarely necessary and can be detrimental. If desired, use a very diluted, balanced fertilizer once during the growing season.
