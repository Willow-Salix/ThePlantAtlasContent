## Introduction
Vachellia rigidula, commonly known as blackbrush acacia or chaparro prieto, and also known as Acacia rigidula, is a species of shrub or small tree in the legume family, Fabaceae.

## Care Guide
Blackbrush acacia thrives on neglect, requiring full sun and infrequent watering to mimic its arid native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to lean soils, thus fertilization is rarely, if ever, needed. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in lean, poor soils and does not require frequent fertilization. Over-fertilizing can be detrimental.
