## Introduction
Ragweeds are flowering plants in the genus Ambrosia in the aster family, Asteraceae. They are distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, especially North America, where the origin and center of diversity of the genus are in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Several species have been introduced to the Old World and some have naturalized and have become invasive species. In Europe, this spread is expected to continue, due to ongoing climate change.
The name "ragweed" is derived from "ragged" + "weed," coming from the ragged appearance of the plant's leaves. Other common names include bursages and burrobrushes. The genus name is from the Greek ambrosia, meaning "food or drink of immortality".
Ragweed pollen is notorious for causing allergic reactions in humans, specifically allergic rhinitis. Up to half of all cases of pollen-related allergic rhinitis in North America are caused by ragweeds.
The most widespread species of the genus in North America is Ambrosia artemisiifolia.

## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, preferring dry conditions and well-draining soil. It is adapted to lean soils, so fertilizer needs are very low or non-existent, making it a low-maintenance plant for arid environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils and does not typically require fertilization.
