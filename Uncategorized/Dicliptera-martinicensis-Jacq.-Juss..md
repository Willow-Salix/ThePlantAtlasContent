## Care Guide
To care for the Martinique Foldwing, provide bright indirect light to partial shade, mimicking its native forest edge environment. Ensure the soil remains consistently moist, allowing only the very top layer to dry out between waterings. Fertilize moderately during the growing season to support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during its active growing season (spring and summer).
