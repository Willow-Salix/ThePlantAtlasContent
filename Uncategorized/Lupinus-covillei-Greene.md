## Care Guide
Shaggy Lupine thrives in full sun with well-drained, often rocky soil, characteristic of its native subalpine habitat. Water moderately during its growing season, letting the soil dry out between sessions. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires little to no nitrogen fertilizer.

### Fertilizer
Low to no nitrogen fertilizer; thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-drained soil.
