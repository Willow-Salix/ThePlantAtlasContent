## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Kaua'i, Hawaiian Islands, USA |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Wet Forest / Bog |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. While some bog plants can tolerate full sun, the frequent cloud cover and high humidity of its native montane bog environment suggest a preference for diffused or morning sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist to wet, never allowing it to dry out. Mimic its native bog environment by ensuring high humidity and regular watering, potentially using a saucer of water to maintain moisture. |

## Introduction
Dubautia or na'ena'e is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. The genus was named after Joseph Eugène DuBaut (1796–1832), an officer in the French Navy who participated in Freycinet's expedition.
The entire genus is endemic to Hawaii. It contains more species than the other two genera in the silversword alliance, including cushion plants, shrubs, trees, and lianas.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian bog hybrid thrives in consistently moist, acidic soil and high humidity, requiring bright indirect to partial sun exposure. Avoid letting the soil dry out and fertilize sparingly, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. Its care should closely mimic its native tropical montane bog environment.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization. Bog soils are typically low in nutrients, so use a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly (e.g., once a month during active growth) or a slow-release formula at a reduced rate.
