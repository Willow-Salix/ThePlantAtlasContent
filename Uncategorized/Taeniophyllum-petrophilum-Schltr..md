## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | New Guinea (primarily Papua New Guinea) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; avoid direct harsh sun which can scorch the leafless stems. |
| **Watering** | Frequent watering, allowing the roots to dry slightly between waterings, paired with very high humidity. Misting or a humid environment is essential. |

## Introduction
Taeniophyllum, commonly known as ribbon roots or 带叶兰属 (dai ye lan shu) is a genus of about 240 species of epiphytic or lithophytic plants from the orchid family, Orchidaceae. Plants in this genus are more or less leafless with a very short stem and roots that are often flat, green and photosynthetic. The flowers are small, short-lived, flat or tube-shaped and arranged on short, thin flowering stems. Orchids in this genus are found in Africa, tropical and subtropical Asia, New Guinea, Australia and some Western Pacific Islands. It is extinct in Malawi.

## Care Guide
This leafless orchid thrives in high humidity and warm temperatures, requiring frequent watering but excellent drainage. Provide dappled, indirect light and fertilize sparingly with a very dilute orchid solution to mimic its native tropical rainforest environment.

### Fertilizer
Very dilute, balanced orchid fertilizer applied sparingly (e.g., once every 2-4 weeks during active growth, less in dormancy).
