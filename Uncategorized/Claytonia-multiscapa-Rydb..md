## Care Guide
As a spring ephemeral from cool, mountainous regions, this plant requires bright light to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil during its brief spring growth. Allow it to dry out significantly once it enters summer dormancy, and provide minimal fertilization, preferring organically rich soil.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring, or enrich soil with compost and organic matter.
