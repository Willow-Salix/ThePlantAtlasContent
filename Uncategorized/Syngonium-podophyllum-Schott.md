## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Mexico, Central America (e.g., Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama), and parts of South America (e.g., Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light. Avoid direct, harsh sunlight which can scorch its leaves, mimicking its native dappled light environment under a dense canopy. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, allowing the top inch or two to dry out between waterings, reflecting the regular rainfall in its native habitat. High humidity is also beneficial. |

## Introduction
Syngonium  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to tropical rainforests in southern Mexico, the West Indies, Central and South America. They are woody vines growing to heights of 10–20 m or more in trees. They have leaves that change shape according to the plant's stage of growth, and adult leaf forms are often much more lobed than the juvenile forms usually seen on small house plants. The scientific name of the genus comes from the Greek words σύν (syn - plus, z) and γονή (gone - gonada) and refers to the fused ovaries of female flowers.

## Care Guide
Syngonium podophyllum thrives in bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil, replicating its tropical rainforest origins. High humidity is crucial, and regular feeding during the growing season will support its lush foliage, making it an adaptable indoor plant.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize monthly during the growing season (spring through summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength, supporting growth in nutrient-rich, rapidly cycling rainforest soils. Reduce or stop fertilizing in fall and winter.
