## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
This saxicolous lichen thrives in bright, exposed, and cool conditions with very high atmospheric humidity. It needs frequent moisture from rain or mist and does not benefit from traditional watering or nutrient application.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens acquire trace nutrients from airborne particles and their substrate, not requiring traditional fertilization.
