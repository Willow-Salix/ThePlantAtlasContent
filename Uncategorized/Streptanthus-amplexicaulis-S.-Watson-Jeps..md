## Care Guide
Clasping Jewel-flower thrives in full sun to partial sun and requires very low water, especially during its summer dormant period, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. It is adapted to lean soils, so minimal to no fertilization is needed. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Adapted to lean, well-draining soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
