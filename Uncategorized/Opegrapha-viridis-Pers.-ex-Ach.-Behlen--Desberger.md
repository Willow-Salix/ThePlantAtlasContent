## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of Europe and North America |
| **Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade; avoids direct sunlight, thriving in the filtered light of a forest understory. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently high ambient humidity and regular moisture from rain or mist; absorbs water directly from the atmosphere and substrate, so avoid prolonged dry periods. |

## Introduction
Opegrapha is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Opegraphaceae. These lichens form crusty patches on bark, rock, or other lichens, and are easily recognized by their distinctive black, slit-like or rounded fruiting bodies that look like tiny scribbles or dashes on the surface. The genus includes more than 100 species found worldwide, with most partnering with orange-pigmented green algae, though some live as parasites on other lichens.

## Care Guide
Opegrapha viridis, a scribble lichen, thrives in cool, humid conditions with filtered light, replicating its native temperate forest environment. Essential care includes maintaining high ambient humidity, protecting it from direct sun and air pollution, and providing a suitable, moist substrate. Traditional fertilizers are not required.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed or recommended; lichens absorb trace nutrients from the air and their substrate (e.g., tree bark).
