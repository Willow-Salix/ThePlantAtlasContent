## Care Guide
Buckbean thrives in consistently wet to submerged conditions, mimicking its native bog and marsh habitats. It prefers full sun to partial shade and generally requires very little to no fertilization, adapting to its naturally nutrient-poor environment. This makes it an excellent choice for water gardens or bog setups where high moisture is maintained.

### Fertilizer
Low; native bog and wetland soils are often nutrient-poor. Minimal to no fertilization is typically needed.
