## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Appalachian region, from North Carolina to Alabama) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun for optimal flowering and fruiting, but can tolerate partial shade, especially in hotter afternoon sun. Requires at least 6 hours of direct sun daily. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting the moderate rainfall of its native habitat. Water regularly during dry periods and during its establishment phase. Moderately drought-tolerant once mature. |

## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
Roundleaf hawthorn thrives in temperate deciduous forest conditions, requiring full sun for best growth and fruit production. It prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil with regular watering during dry spells. Minimal fertilization with compost or a balanced slow-release product supports its modest nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate nutrient needs. An annual top-dressing with compost or a light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is generally sufficient, mimicking the nutrient cycling in forest soils.
