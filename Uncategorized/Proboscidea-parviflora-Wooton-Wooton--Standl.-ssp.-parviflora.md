## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, New Mexico, California) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, consistent with its open desert habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and deep watering. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant, mirroring its adaptation to sporadic desert rainfall. |

## Introduction
Proboscidea parviflora is a species of flowering plant in the family Martyniaceae known by the common names doubleclaw and red devil's-claw. It is native to the desert southwest of the United States and northern Mexico, where it grows in sandy, dry, and disturbed habitat and blooms during the hot summer. This is an annual herb growing from a taproot and producing sprawling, spreading stems. The leaves have rounded, oval, or roughly triangular blades up to 15 centimetres (6 in) long which have smooth edges or faint lobes or teeth. The inflorescence is an array of several showy bell-shaped flowers with five lobes flaring several centimeters wide. The flower is white to pink or purple, sometimes with mottling or lines of spots in the throat, and often a purple blotch on the upper lip. A yellow nectar guide extends along the lower lip. The fruit is a large seed pod many centimeters long, a cylindrical body tapering into a very long, thin, curving tail. As the fruit dries the tail cracks open and splits into two hooked, claw-like halves. The young fruits and seeds were used for food and the dark-colored hardened dry fruits were used in basketry by local Native Americans.

## Care Guide
Doubleclaw flourishes in full sun, reflecting its origins in arid scrublands and deserts. It is extremely drought-tolerant, necessitating infrequent but thorough watering with ample drying periods between. Minimal to no fertilization is required, aligning with its natural adaptation to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils and does not require regular fertilization. If desired, a very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once during its active growing season.
