## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | High Arctic, specifically Ellesmere Island (Nunavut, Canada) and surrounding high arctic regions. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring intense and unobstructed light exposure, reflecting the open, treeless landscape and long daylight hours of the Arctic summer. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture during its brief growing season, often from melting snow and ice, but requires extremely sharp drainage to prevent waterlogging in cold soils. Allow the soil surface to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Draba is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, commonly known as whitlow-grasses (though they are not related to the true grasses).

## Care Guide
This Arctic plant thrives in full sun with excellent air circulation and demands consistently moist yet extremely well-drained soil during its short active growth period. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor tundra, fertilizer requirements are minimal. Protection from heat and humidity is crucial outside its native cold environment.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Native tundra soils are typically poor in nutrients. If fertilized, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly (once per growing season) is more than sufficient, or none at all.
