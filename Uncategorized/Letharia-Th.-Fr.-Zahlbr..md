## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (primarily Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains), Europe (especially Scandinavia, Central Europe) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coniferous Forest, Boreal Forest (Taiga) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. Benefits from good air circulation and can tolerate some direct morning sun, but protection from harsh afternoon sun is necessary to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | As a lichen, it absorbs moisture directly from the air (humidity, fog, rain). Requires consistently high humidity and frequent misting to thrive. Does not have roots for traditional watering; instead, focus on maintaining a moist atmospheric environment. |

## Introduction
Letharia is a genus of fruticose lichens belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. Molecular phylogenetics studies have revealed that what were once considered just two species actually represent at least several distinct evolutionary lineages, with western North America serving as the centre of diversity for the group. These lichens typically grow on sun-exposed wood and bark of coniferous trees, growing in dry habitats where they receive moisture from dew or fog.

## Care Guide
Wolf Lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light and excellent air circulation. It requires frequent misting and high ambient humidity to absorb moisture directly from the air. Conventional fertilizers are not needed and can be detrimental to its health, as it is sensitive to excess nutrients.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer is required or recommended. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from the atmosphere and their substrate; conventional fertilizers can be harmful.
