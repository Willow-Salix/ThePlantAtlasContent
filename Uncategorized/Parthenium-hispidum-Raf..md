## Introduction
Parthenium is a genus of North American annuals, biennials, perennials, subshrubs, and shrubs in the tribe Heliantheae within the family Asteraceae and subfamily Asteroideae.
The name Parthenium is an evolution of the Ancient Greek name παρθένιον (parthenion), which referred to Tanacetum parthenium. The name is possibly derived from the Greek word παρθένος (parthenos) which means "virgin".
Members of the genus are commonly known as feverfew. Notable species include guayule (P. argentatum) which has been used as a rubber substitute, especially during the Second World War; and also P. hysterophorus, a serious invasive species in the Old World.

## Care Guide
To cultivate Wild Quinine, provide full to partial sun exposure and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is a resilient plant that requires moderate watering and minimal fertilization once established. Replicating its native prairie conditions will promote robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in average, well-draining soil. Fertilization is generally not essential, but a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial in poor soils.
