## Care Guide
The Foothill Sunburst is a drought-tolerant plant that requires full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its native Mediterranean shrubland habitat. Water infrequently once established, allowing the soil to dry completely, and apply fertilizer sparingly as it thrives in lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer required. It thrives in naturally lean, well-draining soils and typically does not need supplemental feeding, or only a very light, balanced application if soil is exceptionally poor.
