## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (including parts of California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane (moist, cool environments often found on open or disturbed ground, roadcuts, or banks) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to partial shade, tolerating some direct morning sun but preferring protection from harsh afternoon light. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist, ensuring good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Do not allow the substrate to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## Care Guide
Bryum calobryoides thrives in cool, consistently moist, and well-drained conditions with partial sun to partial shade. Maintaining a humid environment and avoiding complete drying out are crucial for its health. Due to its low nutrient needs, fertilization should be minimal or absent.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Minimal to no fertilization is typically required, as mosses have low nutrient demands. If desired, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly during the growing season.
