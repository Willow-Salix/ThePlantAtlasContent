## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South coast of Western Australia (Walpole and Denmark regions) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Mediterranean Woodland/Shrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for optimal growth and flowering, mimicking its open native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires regular, deep watering when young to establish a strong root system. Once mature, it is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering, primarily during extended dry periods, consistent with Mediterranean dry summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Corymbia ficifolia, commonly known as red flowering gum, is a species of small tree that is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has rough, fibrous bark on the trunk and branches, egg-shaped to broadly lance-shape adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, bright red, pink or orange flowers and urn-shaped fruit. It has a restricted distribution in the wild but is one of the most commonly planted ornamental eucalypts.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Red Flowering Gum thrives in full sun within a temperate Mediterranean climate, enduring dry summers. Ensure consistent watering during its youth, transitioning to drought-tolerant practices upon maturity. Minimal to no fertilization is required, especially avoiding high-phosphorus products.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements. These plants are adapted to nutrient-poor soils; excessive phosphorus can be detrimental. If fertilization is deemed necessary, use a slow-release, low-phosphorus formula specifically for Australian native plants.
