## Introduction
Pontederia is a genus of tristylous aquatic plants, members of which are commonly known as pickerel weeds. Pontederia is endemic to the Americas, distributed from Canada to Argentina, where it is found in shallow water or on mud. The genus was named by Linnaeus in honour of the Italian botanist Giulio Pontedera.
Pontederia plants have large waxy leaves, succulent stems and a thick pad of fibrous roots. The roots give rise to rhizomes that allow rapid colonization by vegetative reproduction. Species are perennial, and produce a large spike of flowers in the summer. There is a species of bee (Dufourea novaeangliae) that exclusively visits Pontederia cordata; waterfowl also eat the fruit of the plant.
Pontederia cordata and Pontederia crassipes (formerly known as Eichhornia crassipes), have become invasive in many tropical and temperate parts of the globe, but are, on the other hand, efficient biological filters of polluted water in constructed wetlands.

## Care Guide
This aquatic plant thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet to submerged conditions, ideally in 6-12 inches of standing water. Provide nutrient-rich aquatic soil and supplement with aquatic plant fertilizer during active growth to ensure vigorous development and abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high; thrives in nutrient-rich aquatic soil. Benefits from aquatic plant fertilizer during the growing season.
