## Care Guide
Russian Tarragon is a hardy, drought-tolerant perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and use fertilizer very lightly if at all. This plant is well-suited for open, temperate garden environments.

### Fertilizer
Low. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring if the soil is poor; otherwise, generally not required. Excessive fertilization can reduce flavor and lead to leggy growth.
