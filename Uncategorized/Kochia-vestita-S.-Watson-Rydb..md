## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, tolerating significant drought. Avoid over-fertilization, as it is accustomed to poor, arid soils and minimal nutrient availability.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none. Adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils, it generally does not require supplemental fertilization.
