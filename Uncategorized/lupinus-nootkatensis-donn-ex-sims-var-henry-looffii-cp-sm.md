## 🧤 Care Instructions
Nootka Lupine thrives in cool, temperate maritime or subalpine climates, requiring full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it needs minimal fertilizer, focusing on phosphorus and potassium if soil is particularly poor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nitrogen; as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches soil. May benefit from phosphorus and potassium in very poor soils, but generally requires minimal feeding.
