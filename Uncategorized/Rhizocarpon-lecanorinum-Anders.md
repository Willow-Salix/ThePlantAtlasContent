## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Alpine regions across the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., Greenland, Scandinavia, North America, European Alps) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High direct sun exposure, tolerant of intense UV radiation. Requires exposed, unobstructed light typically found on rock surfaces above the tree line. |
| **Watering** | Requires infrequent but consistent moisture from rainfall or snowmelt, followed by periods of dryness. Excellent drainage is essential, as waterlogging is detrimental. Misting or occasional natural saturation is suitable. |

## Introduction
Rhizocarpon is a genus of crustose, saxicolous (or sometimes lichenicolous), lecideoid lichens in the family Rhizocarpaceae. The genus is common in arctic-alpine environments, but also occurs throughout temperate, subtropical, and even tropical regions. They are commonly known as map lichens because of the prothallus forming border-like bands between colonies in some species, like the common map lichen (Rhizocarpon geographicum).

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cold, exposed, high-altitude or high-latitude environments. Mimic its native conditions with high direct sunlight, well-drained surfaces, and infrequent, natural watering. Avoid any form of traditional fertilization due to extreme sensitivity.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens thrive in nutrient-poor, oligotrophic environments and are highly sensitive to excess nutrients and atmospheric pollution. Nutritional needs are met by atmospheric deposition.
