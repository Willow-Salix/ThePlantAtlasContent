## Care Guide
This prairie native thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, requiring minimal watering once established due to its drought tolerance. Avoid over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen, as it naturally enriches the soil through nitrogen fixation.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so additional nitrogen fertilizer is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
