## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert annual thrives in bright, full sun conditions and is highly drought-tolerant, preferring the soil to dry out completely between very infrequent waterings. It is adapted to lean desert soils, therefore requiring minimal to no fertilizer. Overall, it needs a hot, dry environment with excellent drainage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. If desired, apply a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer once or twice during the growing season in lean soils.
