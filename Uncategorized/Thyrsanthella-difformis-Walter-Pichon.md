## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (eastern Canada to Florida, west to Texas and Oklahoma) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (understory of deciduous and coniferous forests) |
| **Sunlight** | Requires deep shade to indirect light, as it does not photosynthesize. It thrives in the low light conditions of a forest floor. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil conditions, mimicking the decaying leaf litter of its native forest habitat. Avoid waterlogging or complete drying out. |

## Introduction
Monotropa hypopitys, syn. Hypopitys monotropa, also known as yellow bird's-nest in Britain and Ireland, pinesap and false beechdrops in Canada and the United States, is a herbaceous perennial plant of the Monotropoideae subfamily of the family Ericaceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is scarce within its range. M.hypopitys is a mycotrophic plant which means it obtains nutrients and fixed carbon by parasitizing the mycorrhizal networks of trees. It lacks chlorophyll and does not photosynthesize. The species name, M.hypopitys, is from Latinized Greek hypo-, "under", and pitys, "pine," referring to where pinesap often grows.

## Care Guide
Pinesap is a unique mycoheterotrophic plant that cannot be cultivated conventionally, as its survival hinges on complex symbiotic relationships with specific fungi and their host trees. It requires a stable temperate forest environment with deep shade and consistently moist, organically rich soil. This plant is extremely difficult to grow outside its natural ecosystem and is best left undisturbed.

### Fertilizer
No conventional fertilizer is effective or necessary, as Pinesap is a mycoheterotroph, obtaining all its nutrients indirectly from host fungi associated with tree roots.
