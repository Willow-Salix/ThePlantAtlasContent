## Care Guide
Peppertrees are resilient plants that thrive in full sun and prefer well-draining soil, reflecting their semi-arid native climate. They are highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and have very low fertilizer needs.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. These plants are adapted to poor soils. Fertilize sparingly only if growth appears weak, using a balanced, slow-release product once annually in spring.
