# Piper's Hybrid Wildrye

*Ã—Elytesion piperi (Bowden) Barkworth* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Prairie |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerant of some drought once established, but prefers consistent moisture during active growth. |

## Care Guide
This hybrid grass thrives in full sun conditions typical of North American grasslands. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and generally has low to moderate fertilizer needs, flourishing in average, well-draining soil.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A general-purpose, balanced fertilizer can be applied once in spring if growth seems lacking, but often thrives without much added fertilizer in reasonably fertile soil.
