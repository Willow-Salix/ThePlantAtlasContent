## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Subarctic regions, including Greenland, northern Canada, Alaska, Scandinavia, Russia, and high mountains in temperate zones like the Rocky Mountains. |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect to full sun, tolerating some partial shade, especially in warmer climates where protection from intense afternoon sun may be beneficial. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, but very well-drained soil; thrives in conditions mimicking snowmelt, so avoid waterlogging but do not let it dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
Pygmy Saxifrage thrives in cool, bright conditions with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native alpine and arctic tundra environment. It requires minimal nutrients and protection from extreme heat or prolonged drought.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native soils are typically nutrient-poor, so excessive feeding can be detrimental.
