## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments characteristic of its native Western North American habitats. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and generally does not need supplemental fertilization. Provide ample sunlight and lean soil for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and can be harmed by excessive nutrients.
