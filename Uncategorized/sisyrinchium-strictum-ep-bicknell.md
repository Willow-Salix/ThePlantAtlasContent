| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical (often found in moist open fields, meadows, and pine flatwoods) |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun to partial shade, thriving in open areas where it receives ample sunlight throughout the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking its native habitat with regular rainfall. Water frequently, especially during dry periods, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sisyrinchium is a large genus of annual to perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. Native to the New World, the species are known as blue-eyed grasses. Although they are not true grasses (Poaceae), they are monocots.
Several species in the eastern United States are threatened or endangered. This may be due to niche species emerging from their unique tendency toward rapid speciation which helps them adapt to specialized arenic (sandy) habitats.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Strict Blue-Eyed Grass, provide full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Water regularly to prevent drying out, especially in its native humid subtropical climate. Fertilization is generally light, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Tolerates a range of soil fertility but benefits from moderately rich soil. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can encourage vigorous growth.
