## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in high humidity and dappled to partial shade, similar to its native habitat on tree bark in humid subtropical forests. It requires regular misting and good air circulation, but no conventional fertilization, as it sources nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from the air and water; conventional fertilizers can be harmful.
