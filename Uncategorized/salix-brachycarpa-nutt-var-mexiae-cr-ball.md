## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | High elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine/Subalpine wetlands, wet meadows, and streambanks; characterized by cool temperatures, abundant moisture from snowmelt, and intense sunlight. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. This plant thrives in open, high-altitude environments where it receives direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its natural habitat along streambanks and wet meadows where water is plentiful from snowmelt and rainfall. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To cultivate this willow, provide full sun exposure and maintain consistently moist to wet soil, reflecting its native subalpine wetland habitat. While not a heavy feeder, ensuring adequate moisture is paramount for its health and vigor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; in its native habitat, nutrients are often supplied by organic matter in riparian soils. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in spring if growth appears weak, but it's generally not a heavy feeder.
