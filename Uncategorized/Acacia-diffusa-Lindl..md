## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant Australian native thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its natural habitat in temperate woodlands and heathlands. Once established, it requires minimal watering and should be fertilized sparingly with a low-phosphorus product to prevent nutrient imbalance.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Use a slow-release, low-phosphorus fertilizer specifically formulated for Australian native plants if soil is very poor, otherwise it's generally not needed.
