## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
The Frosted Hawthorn thrives in full sun to partial shade, mimicking its native habitat in temperate forests. It requires moderate, consistent watering, though established plants are somewhat drought-tolerant. Best growth is achieved in fertile, organic-rich soil with minimal to moderate fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, benefiting from fertile, well-drained soils rich in organic matter, typical of temperate forest floors.
