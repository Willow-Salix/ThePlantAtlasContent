## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Antarctic regions, high-altitude alpine zones globally (e.g., Greenland, Svalbard, Himalayas, Rocky Mountains, Alps). |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Polar Desert (found in moist microclimates, often near melting snow or water sources). |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Avoid intense, direct sun which can lead to rapid desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist, never allowing the substrate to dry out. Requires very high ambient humidity. |

## Introduction
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## Care Guide
This alpine and arctic moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and highly humid conditions with bright, indirect light or partial shade. It requires very little in terms of nutrients, and protection from intense, direct sun to prevent drying out, needing its substrate to remain perpetually damp.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Fertilization is generally not required; excessive nutrients can be detrimental to moss health.
