## Care Guide
Bird's-Foot Trefoil is a hardy legume best suited for full to partial sun in temperate climates, requiring moderate watering but tolerating drought once established. Its natural ability to fix nitrogen minimizes the need for external fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for various landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low to no nitrogen fertilizer is required due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume. If soil is extremely poor, a balanced fertilizer with low nitrogen, or higher in phosphorus and potassium, can be applied sparingly.
