## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient plant thrives in full sun, requiring minimal water once established due to its arid grassland origins. Ensure well-draining soil and avoid excessive fertilization to mimic its natural environment. It is a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny locations.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required; thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile, well-drained soils.
