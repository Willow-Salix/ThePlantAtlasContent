## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in very moist to wet conditions, mimicking its native wetland and bog environments. It prefers full to partial sun exposure and does not require heavy fertilization. Ensure the soil remains consistently saturated.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately rich soils typical of its wetland habitats, suggesting minimal fertilization.
