## 🌱 Overview
Navarretia is a genus of flowering plants related to the phloxes and the gilias. This is one genus of plants, among others, which are sometimes called pincushion plants. It includes 45 species native to the Americas. In North America they range from western Canada through the western and west-central United States to northwestern Mexico, and to Ohio and Pennsylvania. In South America they range through Argentina and Chile.
The inflorescence which bears the flowers is surrounded by frilly green bracts bearing soft spines, giving it the appearance of a pincushion. Several species are members of the vernal pool ecosystem.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bridges' Gilia is a native California annual that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. It requires consistent moisture during its active growth cycle in winter and spring, followed by a dry dormancy period in summer. This plant is well-adapted to Mediterranean garden conditions and generally needs minimal fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; typically not a heavy feeder. If soils are very poor, a light, balanced fertilizer can be applied during its growth phase.
