## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (high-elevation mountains of the USA and Canada, including the Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada, and Cascade Range) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine Coniferous Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily); thrives in open, high-altitude exposures. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture during establishment, but mature trees are drought-tolerant. Absolutely requires extremely well-drained soil to prevent root rot, mimicking its native rocky, well-drained slopes. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pinus albicaulis, known by the common names whitebark pine, white bark pine, white pine, pitch pine, scrub pine, and creeping pine, is a conifer tree native to the mountains of the western United States and Canada, specifically subalpine areas of the Sierra Nevada, Cascade Range, Pacific Coast Ranges, Rocky Mountains, and Ruby Mountains. It shares the common name "creeping pine" with several other plants.
The whitebark pine is typically the highest-elevation pine tree found in these mountain ranges and often marks the tree line. Thus, it is often found as krummholz, trees growing close to the ground that have been dwarfed by exposure. In more favorable conditions, the trees may grow to 29 meters (95 ft) in height.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Whitebark pine thrives in full sun and very well-drained, nutrient-poor soil, reflective of its harsh native subalpine and alpine environments. Consistent moisture is crucial for young plants, but mature trees are drought-tolerant and sensitive to waterlogging. Fertilization is generally unnecessary and best avoided.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required; thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky mountain soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
