## Introduction
Prenanthes is a genus of plant in the family Asteraceae, often referred to as rattlesnake root.
Molecular analysis in 2009 revealed that the genus as traditionally envisioned was polyphyletic, meaning that it is a conglomeration of species not closely related to one another. The genus formerly included species now placed in Aetheorhiza, Askellia, Brickellia, Chondrilla, Crepidiastrum, Crepis, Emilia, Erythroseris, Faberia, Hololeion, Hypochaeris, Ixeris, Lactuca, Lapsanastrum, Launaea, Lygodesmia, Nabalus, Notoseris, Paraprenanthes, Parasenecio, Picrosia, Sonchella, Sonchus, Soroseris, Stephanomeria, Trixis, and Youngia.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade, mimicking its native open woodland and pine barren habitats. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and requires minimal fertilization as it is adapted to less fertile, sandy or rocky soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilization; this plant is adapted to less fertile, sandy or rocky soils typical of its native pine barrens and open woods.
