## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hooker's Wildparsley is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant best suited for full sun exposure and very well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native montane scrubland habitat. It requires infrequent watering once established, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to none; thrives in lean, rocky soils. An annual light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if soil is extremely poor.
