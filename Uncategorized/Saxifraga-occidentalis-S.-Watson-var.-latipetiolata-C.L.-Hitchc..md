## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, Montana) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun, ideally with protection from intense afternoon sun. Can tolerate more direct sun in cooler climates or higher altitudes. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage; do not allow it to become waterlogged. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
This montane plant thrives in cool, consistently moist, well-drained conditions, mimicking its subalpine origins. Provide bright indirect to partial sun, avoiding intense afternoon heat, and fertilize sparingly during its growing period.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding is sufficient. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season (spring to early summer).
