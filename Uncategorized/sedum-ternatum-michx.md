## 🌱 Overview
Sedum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, members of which are commonly known as stonecrops. The genus has been described as containing up to 600 species, subsequently reduced to 400–500. They are leaf succulents found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, but extending into the southern hemisphere in Africa and South America. The plants vary from annual and creeping herbs to shrubs. The plants have water-storing leaves. The flowers usually have five petals, seldom four or six. There are typically twice as many stamens as petals. Various species formerly classified as Sedum are now in the segregate genera Hylotelephium and Rhodiola.
Well-known European species of Sedum are Sedum acre, Sedum album, Sedum dasyphyllum, and Sedum hispanicum.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Woodland stonecrop thrives in partial to full shade, needing protection from intense afternoon sun. It prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil and requires minimal fertilization, reflecting its native understory habitat in temperate forests. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Its native woodland soils are often rich in organic matter but not excessively fertile. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is sufficient.
