## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Wetland/Riparian |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in open, bright locations but tolerates some dappled shade. |
| **Watering** | High water requirements; soil must be consistently wet to saturated, mimicking its native boggy and stream bank habitats. Cannot tolerate drought. |

## Introduction
Pleuropogon is a genus of Arctic and North American plants in the grass family known generally as semaphore grass.
Pleuropogon native primarily to North America, with one species extending into Arctic Eurasia. These are erect grasses with drooping leaves. They grow in wet areas, sometimes even to the point of being partially submerged at times.

## Care Guide
This temperate wetland grass thrives in consistently wet to saturated soil and prefers full to partial sun exposure. Ensure its roots never dry out, replicating its native boggy and riparian environments. Incorporate organic matter into the soil for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from rich organic soil amendments to support lush growth, but typically does not require heavy or frequent fertilization if soil is already fertile.
