| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (specifically, shaded forest floors and stream banks) |
| **Sunlight** | Very low light to partial shade. Prefers consistently diffused light, avoiding direct sunlight which can scorch its delicate fronds. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist conditions and high humidity. Water frequently to keep substrate damp but not waterlogged. Misting is beneficial to maintain humidity. |

## Care Guide
Reese's fissidens moss thrives in a consistently moist, high-humidity environment with very low light, mimicking its native habitat on shaded stream banks and rocks. Ensure the substrate remains damp and provide regular misting, avoiding any direct sun exposure to prevent damage.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. Mosses derive most nutrients from water and the substrate. If used, a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year.
