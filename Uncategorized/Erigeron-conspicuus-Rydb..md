## Care Guide
Showy Fleabane, native to Western North America's montane and subalpine regions, thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate, consistent watering in well-drained soil and has low to moderate fertilization needs. This hardy perennial is relatively low-maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to lean, well-drained soils. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth. A light application of balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or compost in early spring is generally sufficient.
