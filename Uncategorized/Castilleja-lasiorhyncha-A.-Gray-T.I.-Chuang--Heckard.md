## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | San Bernardino Mountains, Southern California, USA |
| **Climate** | Montane and Subalpine Meadows and Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives with ample direct light, typical of open mountain meadows and forest clearings. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture during its growing season (spring and early summer), preferring well-drained soil. Tolerant of short dry periods once established, reflecting its native Mediterranean-influenced mountain habitat. |

## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
This montane wildflower flourishes in full to partial sun with consistently moist, well-drained soil, echoing its native mountain meadows. As a hemiparasite, it needs only low to moderate fertilization. Ensure adequate watering during its peak growing period in spring and early summer to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a hemiparasitic plant, it typically derives nutrients from host plants and does not require heavy fertilization; over-fertilization should be avoided.
