## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia (Queensland, New South Wales) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Monsoonal Climate (often on rainforest margins or open woodlands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure is ideal, mirroring its natural habitat where it often grows in open areas or at the forest edge, receiving abundant direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | During its active growing season (spring/summer), water deeply and regularly, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Reduce watering significantly during cooler months or dormancy, reflecting its native dry season. |

## Introduction
Brachychiton (kurrajong, bottletree) is a genus of 31 species of trees and large shrubs, native to Australia (the centre of diversity, with 30 species) and New Guinea (one species). Fossils from New South Wales and New Zealand are estimated to be 50 million years old, corresponding to the Paleogene.

## Care Guide
The Flame Bottletree thrives in full sun and requires deep, regular watering during its active growth period, with a significant reduction in winter to mimic its native dry season. Moderate fertilization in spring and summer supports its robust growth, ensuring good drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Requires moderate fertilization. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a diluted liquid fertilizer during the spring and summer months to support vigorous growth, as native soils are often not excessively rich but provide sufficient nutrients.
