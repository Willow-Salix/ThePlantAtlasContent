## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, specifically the Midwestern and Southeastern United States (e.g., Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade, particularly in summer when the deciduous tree canopy is full. It can tolerate more early spring sun before trees leaf out. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial during its active growing period in spring, but it requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Reduce watering significantly as it goes dormant in late summer and fall. |

## Introduction
Trillium (trillium, wakerobin, toadshade, tri flower, birthroot, birthwort, and sometimes "wood lily") is a genus of about fifty flowering plant species in the family Melanthiaceae. Trillium species are native to temperate regions of North America and Asia, with the greatest diversity of species found in the southern Appalachian Mountains in the southeastern United States.

## Care Guide
This woodland native prefers a temperate climate with consistent moisture and partial to full shade, especially during the summer. Plant in rich, well-drained organic soil, and allow it to go dormant by reducing water in late summer as leaves naturally die back.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in rich, organic woodland soil. Amend with compost or leaf mold annually in early spring. A light application of a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer can be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary in good soil.
