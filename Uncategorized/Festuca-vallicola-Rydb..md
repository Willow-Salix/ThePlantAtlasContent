## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Canada and USA, particularly the Rocky Mountains region) |
| **Climate** | Montane Grassland / Subalpine Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it thrives in open, exposed mountain environments without significant canopy cover. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, preferring well-drained soils and tolerating periods of drought once established, consistent with areas receiving moderate precipitation (often snowmelt and summer storms). |

## Introduction
Festuca viridula is a species of grass known by several common names, including green fescue, greenleaf fescue, and mountain bunchgrass. It is native to western North America from British Columbia to Colorado, where it is most abundant in high-elevation forests and meadows.

## Care Guide
This hardy fescue thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping or rocky gardens. It requires moderate watering, especially when establishing, but is quite drought-tolerant thereafter and needs minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low, as it is adapted to the naturally less fertile soils found in montane and subalpine regions.
