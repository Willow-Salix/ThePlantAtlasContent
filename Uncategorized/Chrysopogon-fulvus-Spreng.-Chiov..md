## Care Guide
This hardy grass, native to tropical and subtropical grasslands of Africa and Asia, thrives in full sun. It requires moderate watering during active growth but is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing only low to moderate fertilization to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It is not a heavy feeder; a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring is sufficient if the soil is poor.
