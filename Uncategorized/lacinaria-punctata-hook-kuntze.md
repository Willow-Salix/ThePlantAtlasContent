## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dotted Blazing Star thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native prairie habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering and generally no or very little fertilizer. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; generally does not require much fertilization, especially in average garden soil. Over-fertilization can lead to weak growth. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring if soil is very poor.
