## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Santa Lucia Mountains, coastal California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Montane Coniferous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for best growth but tolerates some afternoon shade, particularly in hotter regions or when young. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during dry periods. While native to a dry-summer climate, it grows in canyons where moisture is more abundant; avoid prolonged drought. |

## Introduction
Abies bracteata, the Santa Lucia fir or bristlecone fir, is the rarest fir in North America. It is confined to steep-sided slopes and the bottoms of rocky canyons in the Santa Lucia Mountains, in the Big Sur region on the central coast of California, United States.

## Care Guide
The Bristlecone Fir thrives in full sun to partial shade within a Mediterranean-type climate, preferring cool, moist winters and dry summers. Provide consistent moisture, especially during dry periods, ensuring well-draining soil, and offer light annual fertilization to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, or an annual top-dressing of compost, is usually sufficient.
