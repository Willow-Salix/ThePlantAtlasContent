## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern Australia (southeastern Queensland and northeastern New South Wales) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Temperate Dry Woodlands and Sclerophyll Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring full sun for optimal growth and flowering, reflecting its natural exposure in open woodlands. |
| **💧 Water** | Tolerates drought once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking its adaptation to dry periods in its native habitat. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Australian native thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions, requiring full sun to partial shade. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions to mimic its drought-tolerant nature. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, as it's adapted to low-nutrient soils and fixes its own nitrogen.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required, especially for established plants, due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume and adaptation to nutrient-poor Australian soils. If absolutely necessary, use a very low-phosphorus native plant fertilizer.
