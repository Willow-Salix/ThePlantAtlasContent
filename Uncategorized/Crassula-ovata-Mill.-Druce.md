## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South Africa (Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces) |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Subtropical |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to bright indirect light; thrives with several hours of direct sunlight, similar to its native exposed habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and thorough watering; allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking drought periods in its native climate. Reduce frequency significantly in winter. |

## Introduction
Crassula ovata, commonly known as jade plant, lucky plant, money plant or money tree, is a succulent plant with small pink or white flowers that is native to the KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa, and Mozambique; it is common as a houseplant worldwide. Much of its popularity stems from the low levels of care needed; the jade plant requires little water and can survive in most indoor conditions. It is sometimes referred to as the money tree; however, Pachira aquatica also has this nickname.

## Care Guide
The Jade Plant thrives on neglect, requiring minimal attention to mimic its native semi-arid environment. Provide abundant bright light, including some direct sun, and water sparingly, ensuring the soil is completely dry between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilize only occasionally during the growing season with a diluted succulent-specific feed.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; apply a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (or succulent-specific blend) once or twice during the spring/summer growing season, as native soils are not typically rich.
