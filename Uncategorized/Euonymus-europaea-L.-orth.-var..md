## Introduction
Euonymus europaeus, the spindle, European spindle, or common spindle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Celastraceae, native to much of Europe, where it inhabits the edges of forest, hedges and gentle slopes, tending to thrive on nutrient-rich, chalky and salt-poor soils. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree.

## Care Guide
The European Spindle is a hardy plant that thrives in a range of light conditions from full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained, consistently moist soil. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions, and a general-purpose fertilizer once a year in spring if needed. It is adaptable and relatively low-maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied in spring, especially if the soil is poor or growth is desired. Generally not a heavy feeder.
