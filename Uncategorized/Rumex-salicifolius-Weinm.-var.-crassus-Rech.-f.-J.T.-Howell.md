## Introduction
The docks and sorrels, genus Rumex, are a genus of about 200 species of annual, biennial, and perennial herbs in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae.
Members of this genus are very common perennial herbs with a native almost worldwide distribution, and introduced species growing in the few places where the genus is not native.
Some are nuisance weeds (and are sometimes called dockweed or dock weed), but some are grown for their edible leaves. Rumex species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species, and are the only host plants of Lycaena dispar and Lycaena rubidus.

## Care Guide
This variety of Willow Dock thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions typical of its native coastal dunes. Provide regular watering, ensuring consistent moisture without waterlogging, and fertilize sparingly due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils. It is quite resilient and tolerant of various conditions once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils; excessive fertilization is generally unnecessary.
