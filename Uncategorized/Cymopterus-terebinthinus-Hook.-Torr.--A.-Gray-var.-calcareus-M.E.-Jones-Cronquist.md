## Care Guide
This plant thrives in bright, full sun conditions, mimicking its native arid scrubland environment. It requires very infrequent watering, as it is highly drought-tolerant, and prefers well-draining soil. Fertilizer is generally not needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, making it a low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, during the growing season.
