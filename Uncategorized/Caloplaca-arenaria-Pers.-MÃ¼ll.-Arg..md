## Introduction
Caloplaca is a lichen genus comprising a number of distinct species. Members of the genus are commonly called firedot lichen, jewel lichen. gold lichens, "orange lichens", but they are not always orange, as in the case of C. albovariegata. The distribution of this lichen genus is worldwide, extending from Antarctica to the high Arctic. It includes a portion of northern North America and the Russian High Arctic. There are about thirty species of Caloplaca in the flora of the British Isles.
A new species of Caloplaca, C. obamae, the first species to be named in honor of Barack Obama, was discovered in 2007 on Santa Rosa Island in California and published in March 2009.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions on sandy or rocky substrates. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and precipitation, making traditional watering and fertilization unnecessary. Ensure good air circulation and intermittent natural wetting for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Obtains all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and rainwater.
