## Care Guide
This plant thrives in sunny conditions with well-drained soil. It requires infrequent but thorough watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to semi-arid environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the active growing season, as it's adapted to less nutrient-rich soils.
