## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic regions of North America (Alaska, Canada, Greenland) and Northeast Asia (Siberia, Russian Far East) |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it grows in open, treeless tundra environments. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist during the growing season, but requires excellent drainage to prevent root rot, mimicking its native habitat where moisture comes from meltwater over permafrost. |

## Care Guide
This Arctic Daisy thrives in full sun conditions typical of its open tundra habitat. It requires consistently moist, but extremely well-drained soil, mimicking meltwater availability over permafrost while preventing root rot in cultivation. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; it thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils characteristic of its native habitat.
