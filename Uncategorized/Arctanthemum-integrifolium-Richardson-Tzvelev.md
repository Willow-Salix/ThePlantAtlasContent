## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Arctic Daisy thrives in full sun conditions typical of its open tundra habitat. It requires consistently moist, but extremely well-drained soil, mimicking meltwater availability over permafrost while preventing root rot in cultivation. Fertilization should be minimal, as it is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none; it thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils characteristic of its native habitat.
