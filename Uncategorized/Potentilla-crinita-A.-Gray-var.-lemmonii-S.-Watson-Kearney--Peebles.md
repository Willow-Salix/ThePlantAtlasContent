## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
Lemmon's cinquefoil thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, typical of its montane woodland origins. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and fertilize sparingly. This hardy plant is drought-tolerant once established, making it a low-maintenance choice.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; prefers lean to moderately fertile soils. Over-fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
