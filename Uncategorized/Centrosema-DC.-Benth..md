## Care Guide
This tropical vine flourishes in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. It needs moderate watering, tolerating some drought once established, and benefits from low fertilization due to its natural nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally does not require high nitrogen feeds. An annual application of compost or a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer can support overall vigor if soil is poor.
