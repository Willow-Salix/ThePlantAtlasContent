## Introduction
Isocoma, commonly called jimmyweed or goldenweed, is a genus of North American semi-woody shrubs in the family Asteraceae. It is found in the semi-arid areas of Southwestern United States and Mexico.
The name of this genus is derived from the Greek for "equal hair" referring to the pappus on the seed.
Isocoma species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia bicuspida (recorded on I. drummondii), Schinia erosa (feeds exclusively on I. acradenia) and Schinia tertia (recorded on I. pluriflora).
