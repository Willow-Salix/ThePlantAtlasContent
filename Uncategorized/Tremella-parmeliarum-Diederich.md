## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of Europe (e.g., Belgium, UK, Scandinavia), North America (e.g., USA, Canada), and parts of Asia, wherever its host lichens are present. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forests and Woodlands, or other environments supporting its host lichens. |
| **☀️ Light** | This is a lichenicolous fungus, not a photosynthetic plant. Its presence is entirely dependent on its host lichen. Host lichens, like *Parmelia* species, typically prefer moderate to bright indirect light, often found on tree bark or rocks, avoiding extreme direct sun exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | As a fungus, it requires environmental moisture for growth and spore dispersal. Its host lichens thrive in environments with consistent atmospheric humidity and periodic rainfall, suggesting requirements for a moist, but not waterlogged, environment. |

## 🌱 Overview
Tremella is a genus of fungi in the family Tremellaceae. All Tremella species are parasites of other fungi and most produce anamorphic yeast states. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies), when produced, are gelatinous and are colloquially classed among the "jelly fungi". Over 100 species of Tremella (in its wide sense) are currently recognized worldwide. One species, Tremella fuciformis, is commercially cultivated for food.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tremella parmeliarum is a lichenicolous fungus that exclusively parasitizes specific lichen species, primarily in temperate zones. Its 'care' is synonymous with maintaining a healthy population of its host lichen in its natural environment, which typically involves moderate light, consistent humidity, and appropriate substrates like tree bark or rocks. It cannot be cultivated independently as a standalone 'plant'.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
This fungus is parasitic on specific lichen species (e.g., *Parmelia*). It obtains all necessary nutrients directly from its host and does not require external fertilization. Providing nutrients to the host lichen is not standard practice and would not directly benefit the fungus.
