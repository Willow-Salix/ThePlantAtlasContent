## 🧤 Care Instructions
Red Valerian is a low-maintenance plant that prefers full sun and well-drained, lean soils. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and generally benefits from little to no fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. This plant thrives in poor to average soils and typically does not require supplemental fertilizer. Over-fertilizing can lead to leggy growth and reduced flowering.
