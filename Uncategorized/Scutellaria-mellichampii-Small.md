## 🌱 Overview
Scutellaria is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. They are known commonly as skullcaps. The generic name is derived from the Latin scutella, meaning "a small dish, tray or platter", or "little dish", referring to the shape of the calyx. The common name alludes to the resemblance of the same structure to "miniature medieval helmets". The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution, with species occurring nearly worldwide, mainly in temperate regions.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Avoid waterlogging and fertilize minimally due to its adaptation to lean, sandy conditions. It is relatively low maintenance once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native to somewhat infertile sandy soils, it does not require heavy fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring may be sufficient.
