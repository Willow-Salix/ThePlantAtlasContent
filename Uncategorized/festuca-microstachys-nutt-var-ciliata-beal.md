## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (e.g., California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, British Columbia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean and Arid Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun exposure is preferred due to its native habitat in open grasslands. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to moderate; this plant is highly drought-tolerant once established due to its adaptation to dry summers. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.
Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 640.
Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fescue is a resilient grass native to the dry, sunny grasslands of Western North America. It thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established. Fertilization needs are low, making it a low-maintenance option for dry, sunny landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; typically thrives in lean to poor soils and does not require heavy fertilization. An annual light feeding in spring may be beneficial but is often not necessary.
