## Care Guide
This resilient North American native thrives in full to partial sun with moderate watering, especially during establishment, becoming drought-tolerant thereafter. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires minimal to no supplemental fertilizer, preferring well-drained, lean to average soils.
