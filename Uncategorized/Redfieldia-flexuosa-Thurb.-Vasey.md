| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), as it grows in open, exposed sandy areas. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, especially in well-draining sandy soil. |

## Introduction
Redfieldia, known as blowout grass, is a monotypic genus in the grass family (Poaceae). The sole species, Redfieldia flexuosa, is native to sandhills in the western and central United States. The plants grow in small clusters, protecting each other from the harsh desert conditions.

## Care Guide
Blowout grass thrives in full sun and extremely well-draining, sandy soils, reflecting its native arid grassland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, preferring dry conditions over consistent moisture. Fertilization is generally unnecessary due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer needed. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils and does not thrive with added nutrients.
