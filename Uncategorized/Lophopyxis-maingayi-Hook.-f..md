*Lophopyxis maingayi Hook. f.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeast Asia, including Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. As a liana, it would typically start in the forest understory and climb towards brighter conditions, so it can tolerate a range but thrives without harsh direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil is essential, reflecting the high rainfall of its native habitat. Water frequently to keep the soil damp but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. High ambient humidity is also critical. |

## Care Guide
This tropical rainforest plant requires consistently moist, well-draining soil and high humidity. Provide bright indirect light to partial shade, and feed moderately during its active growth period to support its lush foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season. Rainforest soils are often low in available nutrients, so avoid over-fertilizing.
