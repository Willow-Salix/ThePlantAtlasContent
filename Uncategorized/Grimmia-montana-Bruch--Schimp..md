| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Montane regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Sub-alpine Montane, specifically exposed, dry rocky habitats. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; accustomed to high light exposure on open rock faces and mountain slopes. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; highly drought-tolerant and prefers to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking dry mountain conditions. |

## Care Guide
Grimmia montana is a resilient moss adapted to harsh montane environments. Provide full to partial sun exposure and allow it to dry out extensively between infrequent waterings. Fertilization is generally not needed due to its low nutrient requirements.

### Fertilizer
Very low; typically no fertilization is required as it naturally thrives on nutrient-poor siliceous rocks.
