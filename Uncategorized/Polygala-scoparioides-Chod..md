## Care Guide
Broom Milkwort thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native tropical savanna environment. Water regularly during its active growth, allowing for dry periods between waterings, and reduce during dormancy. Fertilize minimally, as it is adapted to low-nutrient conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils; a balanced, diluted fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the growing season.
