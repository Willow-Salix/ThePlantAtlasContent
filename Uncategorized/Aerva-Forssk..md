## Introduction
Aerva is a genus of plants in the family Amaranthaceae. Its species are native to the palaeotropics, throughout continental Africa, Madagascar and smaller islands (Mauritius and  Socotra), through parts of the Middle East, India, and southeast Asia. Aerva javanica is an alien in northern Australia.
At least four species in the genus have acquired the C4 carbon fixation pathway.

## Care Guide
Aerva is a robust, drought-tolerant plant thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. Mimic its arid native climate by providing infrequent watering and minimal fertilization. Ensure it receives ample sunlight to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and does not require rich substrate.
