## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States, including Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast states, extending inland to some prairie regions |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Coastal Salt Marsh / Temperate Wet Grassland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily due to its open native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently wet to moist soil, tolerating periodic inundation and standing water, reflecting its wetland origin. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sporobolus is a nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. The name Sporobolus means "seed-thrower", and is derived from Ancient Greek word σπόρος (spóros), meaning "seed", and the root of βάλλειν (bállein) "to throw", referring to the dispersion of seeds. Members of the genus are usually called dropseeds or sacaton grasses. They are typical prairie and savanna plants, occurring in other types of open habitat in warmer climates. At least one species (S. caespitosus from Saint Helena) is threatened with extinction, and another (S. durus from Ascension Island) is extinct.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gulf Cordgrass thrives in full sun and consistently wet to moist soil, mimicking its native coastal marsh and wet grassland environments. It tolerates brackish conditions and periodic flooding well. Fertilization should be kept low to moderate, as it's adapted to natural nutrient cycles.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization; native soils are often nutrient-rich from organic matter but it is not a heavy feeder.
