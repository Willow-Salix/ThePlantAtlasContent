| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, Carolinas, Texas) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in open areas or lightly shaded pine flatwoods. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry out slightly between waterings; adapted to periods of drought once established, but appreciates consistent moisture during active growth. Good drainage is essential, as found in its native sandy soils. |

## Care Guide
Provide this panicgrass with full to partial sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native sandy pine barrens. Water moderately, allowing some drying between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing as it is adapted to poorer soils. This resilient grass thrives with minimal intervention once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils and does not typically require heavy feeding.
