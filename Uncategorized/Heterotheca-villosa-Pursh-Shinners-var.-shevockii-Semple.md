## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (Southern Sierra Nevada, Tehachapi Mountains, Transverse Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Woodland and Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | This plant thrives in full sun, reflecting its native habitat in open, dry, and often rocky areas within chaparral, woodland, and forest understories where light exposure is high. |
| **Watering** | Requires low to moderate watering. Given its native to dry, rocky slopes and chaparral, it is highly drought tolerant once established. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during summer months. |

## Care Guide
For optimal growth, provide full sun exposure and well-draining soil, mimicking its native dry, open habitats. This plant is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, along with very low fertilizer application. Its robust nature makes it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or arid garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Has low fertilizer needs. Its native soils are often sandy or rocky and not particularly rich, so excessive fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful. A very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring might be beneficial in very poor soils, but is often not required.
