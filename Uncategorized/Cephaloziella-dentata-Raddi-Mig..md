## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in cool, humid environments with consistent moisture and very low light, mimicking its natural forest floor habitat. It requires a constantly damp substrate and should be protected from direct sunlight and excessive fertilization for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs; avoid heavy fertilization as bryophytes are sensitive to high nutrient concentrations.
