## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Basin (Southern Europe, North Africa, Western Asia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Temperate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day) |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate during active growth, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, especially during summer dormancy. |

## 🌱 Overview
Medicago is a genus of flowering plants, commonly known as medick or burclover, in the legume family (Fabaceae). It contains at least 87 species and is distributed mainly around the Mediterranean Basin, and extending across temperate Eurasia and sub-Saharan Africa. The best-known member of the genus is alfalfa (M. sativa), an important forage crop, and the genus name is based on the Latin name for that plant, medica, from Greek: μηδική (πόα) Median (grass). Most members of the genus are low, creeping herbs, resembling clover, but with burs (hence the common name). However, alfalfa grows to a height of 1 meter, and tree medick (M. arborea) is a shrub. Members of the genus are known to produce bioactive compounds such as medicarpin (a flavonoid) and medicagenic acid (a triterpenoid saponin). Chromosome numbers in Medicago range from 2n = 14 to 48.
The species Medicago truncatula is a model legume due to its relatively small stature, small genome (450–500 Mbp), short generation time (about 3 months), and ability to reproduce both by outcrossing and selfing.
Comprehensive descriptions of the genus are Lesinš and Lesinš 1979 and Small and Jomphe 1989. Major collections are SARDI (Australia), USDA-GRIN (United States), ICARDA (Syria), and INRA (France).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Burr Medic thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, adapted to a Mediterranean climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. It requires moderate watering during its active growth period but is notably drought-tolerant once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it has low to moderate fertilizer needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, reducing the need for external nitrogen fertilization. Thrives in moderately fertile soils.
