## Care Guide
The Panguitch Milkvetch thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy or gravelly soil, mirroring its arid native habitat in Utah. It is highly drought-tolerant, necessitating infrequent watering once established, and has very low fertilizer needs. Optimal care ensures excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally fertile soil. Avoid high nitrogen.
