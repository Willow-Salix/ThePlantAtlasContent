## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mountainous regions across Eurasia (e.g., Alps, Himalayas, Siberia, China, Japan) and North America (e.g., Alaska, Canadian Rockies, Rocky Mountains) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, typical of exposed alpine slopes. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture during its short growing season, primarily from snowmelt, but demands excellent drainage. Keep drier during dormancy. |

## Introduction
Gagea serotina, synonym Lloydia serotina, is an Arctic–alpine flowering plant of the lily family. It is widespread across the mountainous parts of western North America, from Alaska to New Mexico, and in Europe is found in the Alps, the Carpathians and the mountains of Bulgaria, as well as in Great Britain. It is also native to much of Central Asia, Siberia, China, Nepal, Mongolia, Korea and Japan.
It was originally known as mountain spiderwort, but is now known in Great Britain as the Snowdon lily, or in Welsh as lili'r Wyddfa. In North America, it is called the common alplily. It is also known as Snowdon alplily.

## Care Guide
This alpine species thrives in conditions mimicking its native habitat: full to partial sun, excellent drainage, and consistent moisture during its brief growing period. It requires a cold, dry dormancy. Provide lean, rocky soil to ensure success.

### Fertilizer
Low. Alpine soils are typically lean. If necessary, a very dilute, balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied at the start of the growing season.
