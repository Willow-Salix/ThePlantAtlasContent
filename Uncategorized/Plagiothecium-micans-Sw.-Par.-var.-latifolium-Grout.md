## Care Guide
This moss thrives in environments mimicking a temperate forest floor, requiring consistently moist conditions and very high humidity. It needs very low light, avoiding any direct sun exposure. Fertilization is rarely necessary, as these plants are accustomed to low-nutrient substrates.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. If necessary, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly (e.g., once or twice a year).
