## Care Guide
This plant thrives in perpetually wet, highly acidic, nutrient-poor soil under full to partial sun, typical of its native bog habitat. Mimic these conditions by providing constant moisture and avoiding rich, alkaline soils or excessive fertilization to ensure success.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low. These plants are adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Over-fertilization is harmful. Use a very dilute, acid-specific fertilizer sparingly, if growth is weak, otherwise avoid.
