## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | West-central New Mexico, USA |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / High Desert (Chihuahuan Desert) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct, intense sunlight daily. Needs unshaded exposure typical of its desert habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent and deep watering during the active growing season (spring to early summer), allowing the soil to dry out completely for several weeks between waterings. Keep almost entirely dry during fall and winter dormancy to prevent rot, mimicking desert drought cycles. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sclerocactus ("hard cactus", from Greek; refers to the hard, dry fruit) is a genus of cacti.  It comprises about 15 species, the exact number depending on the authority. These species are xerophytic. They are sometimes called 'fishhook cactus' or 'little barrels.'

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert cactus demands maximum sun exposure and extremely infrequent watering, especially during its dormant period, to replicate its arid native habitat. It thrives in exceptionally well-draining, lean soil, requiring minimal to no fertilizer to prevent over-enrichment and promote healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very minimal. Use a highly diluted, low-nitrogen cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season, or abstain entirely if repotting annually with fresh, gritty cactus mix, as native soils are nutrient-poor.
