## Care Guide
To care for Painted Milkvetch, provide full sun and ensure well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid scrubland habitat. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely to accommodate its drought-tolerant nature. Fertilizer is rarely necessary due to its adaptation to lean soils and nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy soils and, as a legume, fixes its own nitrogen.
