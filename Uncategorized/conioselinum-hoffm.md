## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hemlockparsley thrives in cool, consistently moist environments, preferring conditions similar to its native temperate to subarctic habitats. It requires regular watering to keep the soil moist and performs best in partial to full sun, ideally with some afternoon shade in warmer regions. Moderate fertilization supports healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied annually in spring, or a diluted liquid fertilizer monthly during the growing season, should suffice. Native soils are often organically rich.
