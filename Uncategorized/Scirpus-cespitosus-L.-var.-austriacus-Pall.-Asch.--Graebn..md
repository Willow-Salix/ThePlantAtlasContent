## Care Guide
This plant thrives in constantly wet, acidic conditions mimicking its native bog and moorland habitats. Provide full to partial sun and ensure the soil remains saturated at all times, never allowing it to dry out. Minimal to no fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient requirements; adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor peat soils. Avoid heavy fertilization, which can be detrimental.
