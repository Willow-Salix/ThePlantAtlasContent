## Care Guide
This plant thrives in consistently moist, shaded to partially shaded conditions, typical of its native Asian forest understory. It requires frequent watering to maintain damp soil and can manage with low to moderate fertilization. Its robust nature makes it an aggressive competitor in suitable environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. A light application of balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient. It is not a heavy feeder and can tolerate less fertile soils.
