## Care Guide
Alvord Milkvetch requires full sun exposure and infrequent watering, mimicking its high desert native habitat. It thrives in lean, well-draining soil and generally does not need supplemental fertilizer due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. Prefers lean, well-draining, rocky or sandy soils.
