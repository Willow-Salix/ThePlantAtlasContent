## Care Guide
This arctic grass requires full to partial sun and consistently wet soil, ideally mimicking its cold, damp, and often saline native habitat. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor tundra, it needs very little, if any, supplemental fertilizer to thrive.

### Fertilizer
Low; adapted to nutrient-poor tundra soils. Minimal fertilization is needed, if any.
