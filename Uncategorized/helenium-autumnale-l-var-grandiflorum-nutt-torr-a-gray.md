## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern and Central North America (widespread across the United States and Canada) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Wetland / Moist Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun (requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal flowering). |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil; requires regular and ample watering, especially during dry periods, as it does not tolerate drought well. |

## 🌱 Overview
Helenium is a genus of annuals and herbaceous perennial plants in the family Asteraceae, native to the Americas.
They bear yellow or orange daisy-like composite flowers. A number of these species (particularly Helenium autumnale) have the common name sneezeweed, based on the former use of their dried leaves in making snuff. It was inhaled to cause sneezing that would supposedly rid the body of evil spirits. Larger species may grow up to 2 metres (6.6 ft) tall.
The genus is named for Helen of Troy, daughter of Zeus and Leda.
Helenium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Phymatopus behrensii.
Genus level properties: most conspicuously globe-like disk-shaped flowers, rays three-lobed at tip.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Fall Sneezeweed thrives in conditions mirroring its native temperate wetlands and moist meadows, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently wet or moist soil. Ensure regular and abundant watering, especially during dry spells, and provide fertile, organically rich soil for robust growth and prolific blooming.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers fertile, organically rich soil. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in early spring can promote vigorous growth, but is often not strictly necessary in good soil.
