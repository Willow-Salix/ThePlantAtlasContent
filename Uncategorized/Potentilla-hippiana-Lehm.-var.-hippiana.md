## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (USA and Canada), particularly the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains regions. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie and Subalpine zones. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. As a plant of open prairies and subalpine meadows, it is adapted to high levels of direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Thrives in environments with consistent moisture but tolerates periods of drought once established. Ensure well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging, mimicking its native habitat where soils can be moist but rarely boggy. |

## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
Woolly Cinquefoil thrives in full to partial sun with moderate watering, ensuring well-drained soil. It is relatively low maintenance regarding nutrients, performing well in average to lean soil conditions. This plant is well-suited for gardens mimicking its native prairie or subalpine environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It typically grows in average to lean soils in its natural range and does not require heavy fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring, if needed for vigor, is sufficient.
