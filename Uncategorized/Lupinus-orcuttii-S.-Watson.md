## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Orcutt's Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its native Mediterranean chaparral. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering, especially during dry summer months. Avoid excessive fertilization as it is a nitrogen-fixer and prefers leaner soil.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and prefers lean, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, can be detrimental.
