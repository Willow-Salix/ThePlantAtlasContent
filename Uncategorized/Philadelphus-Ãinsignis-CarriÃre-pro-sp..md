## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Europe (cultivated hybrid origin, specifically France) |
| **Climate** | Temperate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; full sun promotes the most abundant flowering. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during dry periods. Water regularly until established, then it tolerates some drought. |

## Introduction
Philadelphus () (mock-orange) is a genus of about 60 species of shrubs from 3–20 ft (1–6 m) tall, native to North America, Central America, Asia and (locally) in southeast Europe.
They are named "mock-orange" in reference to their flowers, which in wild species look somewhat similar to those of oranges and lemons (Citrus) at first glance, and smell of orange flowers and jasmine (Jasminum). But Philadelphus is a basal asterid, not closely related to Jasminum (advanced asterids), and among the eudicots quite distant from Citrus (advanced rosids). An entirely misleading name for Philadelphus that is sometimes encountered is syringa; this properly refers to the lilacs, which are fairly close relatives of jasmine. The connection of the two shrubs lies in their introduction from Ottoman gardens to European ones, effected at the same time by the Holy Roman emperor's ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, who returned to Vienna in 1562. The two shrubs appear together in John Gerard's Herball, as "Blew Pipe" (the lilac) and "White Pipe Tree", for the woods of both are pithy and easily hollowed out.
Philadelphus is named after an ancient Greek king of Egypt, Ptolemy II Philadelphus.

## Care Guide
This temperate hybrid prefers full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil to encourage prolific summer blooms. It is moderately adaptable to various soil types and once established, tolerates some drought. Fertilization in spring supports healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, but generally not a heavy feeder.
