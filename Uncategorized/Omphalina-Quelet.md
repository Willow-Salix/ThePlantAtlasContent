## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate forests across Europe and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically, damp, shaded undergrowth) |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires very low light to near darkness, as direct sunlight is detrimental to fungal growth and can cause desiccation. Thrives in shaded, sheltered environments typical of forest floors. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently damp conditions and high humidity, mirroring its native habitat among mosses and decaying matter on the forest floor. Avoid waterlogging, but ensure the substrate remains moist. |

## 🌱 Overview
Omphalina is a genus of small agarics with white, nonamyloid, basidiospores and decurrent gills. Typically the cap has a deep central depression giving the umbrella-like to funnel-shaped cap the appearance of a belly button, or a belly with a navel. Similarly-shaped agarics are said to be omphalinoid in appearance.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fungal species requires a consistently damp, humid, and very low-light environment, typically on a substrate rich in decaying organic material like moss or wood. Providing these specific conditions, rather than traditional plant care, is crucial for its growth and survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional plant fertilizers. Instead, it thrives on a substrate rich in decaying organic matter, such as decaying wood, leaf litter, or moss, from which it obtains its nutrients as a saprophyte.
