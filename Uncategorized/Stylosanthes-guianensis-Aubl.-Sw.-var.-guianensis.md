## Care Guide
This tropical legume flourishes in full sun with consistent watering during its growth periods, showing good drought tolerance once established. Its nitrogen-fixing capabilities mean it has low to moderate fertilizer needs, primarily benefiting from phosphorus and potassium in nutrient-deficient soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a legume, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen, reducing the need for nitrogen fertilizers. Benefits from phosphorus and potassium, particularly in poor soils, to support root development and overall vigor.
