## 🌱 Overview
The lemon (Citrus × limon) is a species of small evergreen tree in the Citrus genus of the flowering plant family Rutaceae. A true lemon is a hybrid of the citron and the bitter orange. Its origins are uncertain, but some evidence suggests lemons originated during the 1st millennium BC in what is now northeastern India. Some other citrus fruits are called lemon.
The yellow fruit of the lemon tree is used throughout the world, primarily for its juice. The pulp and rind are used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is about 5–6% citric acid, giving it a sour taste. This makes it a key ingredient in drinks and foods such as lemonade and lemon meringue pie.
In 2022, world production was 22 million tonnes, led by India with 18% of the total.

Provide full sun and consistent watering, ensuring the soil drains well to prevent root rot. Fertilize regularly with a citrus-specific blend to meet its high nutrient demands, especially during growing seasons, for optimal health and fruit yield.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Heavy feeder. Requires regular fertilization with a balanced citrus-specific fertilizer, particularly during spring and summer, to support robust growth and fruit development.
