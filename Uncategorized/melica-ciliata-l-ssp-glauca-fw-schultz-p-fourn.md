| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Southern Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia, particularly in dry, rocky areas. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Dry Mediterranean and Temperate Grasslands, Steppe, and open rocky slopes. |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure. Prefers full sun to thrive, tolerating some partial shade but requiring bright light. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering and waterlogged conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Melica is a genus of perennial grasses known generally as melic or melic grass. They are found in most temperate regions of the world.

Melic grasses are clumping to short-rhizomatous grasses. They have flowering culms up to 250 cm (98 in) tall bearing spikelets of papery flowers. The spikelets have between one and seven fertile flowers with a rudimentary structure at the distal end composed of one to four sterile florets. Some species of melic have corms, lending them the name oniongrass.
The genus is most diverse in South America and temperate Asia. Eight species are endemic to China. In North America, most species occur west of the Mississippi River, with exceptions being Melica mutica and M. nitens which occur throughout much of the southeast and lower Midwest respectively.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Glaucous Melick thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its origins in dry grasslands and rocky slopes. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established. Fertilization is generally not necessary.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-drained soils. Fertilize very sparingly, if at all, as rich soils can promote weak growth.
