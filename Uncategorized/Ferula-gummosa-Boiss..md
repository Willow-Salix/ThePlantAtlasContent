## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan (mountainous regions of the Middle East) |
| **Climate** | Arid to semi-arid montane steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure is essential. It thrives in open, unshaded environments typical of its native mountainous and steppe habitats. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Galbanum is an aromatic gum resin and a product of certain umbelliferous Persian plant species in the genus Ferula, chiefly Ferula gummosa (synonym F. galbaniflua) and Ferula rubricaulis. Galbanum-yielding plants grow plentifully on the slopes of the mountain ranges of northern Iran. It occurs usually in hard or soft, irregular, more or less translucent and shining lumps, or occasionally in separate tears, of a light-brown, yellowish or greenish-yellow colour. Galbanum has a disagreeable, bitter taste, a peculiar, somewhat musky odour, and an intense green scent. With a specific gravity of 1.212, it contains about 8% terpenes; about 65% of a resin which contains sulfur; about 20% gum; and a very small quantity of the colorless crystalline substance umbelliferone. It also contains α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene, cadinene, 3-carene, and ocimene.

## Care Guide
Galbanum thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil to mimic its arid montane origins. Water sparingly, allowing significant dry periods between irrigations, and fertilize minimally to ensure healthy growth without causing root issues.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer is needed. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, or a general-purpose feed, is sufficient, especially if planted in naturally poor soil.
