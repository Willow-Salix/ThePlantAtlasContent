## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native boggy and savanna habitats. A light to moderate feeding schedule supports healthy growth, particularly during its active season, without over-fertilizing.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season; its native soils are often nutrient-poor, so over-fertilization should be avoided.
