# Alectoria Nadvornikiana Gyel.

*Alectoria nadvornikiana Gyel.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Montane and boreal forests across Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe (e.g., Carpathians, Sudetes, Scandinavian mountains) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light or dappled shade; avoids strong, direct sunlight typical of dense forest understories. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity is crucial; absorbs moisture from air, fog, and rain. Requires frequent misting or a consistently humid environment, but can tolerate periods of dryness. |

## Care Guide
Alectoria Nadvornikiana thrives in a cool, highly humid environment with indirect light, mimicking its native montane forest habitat. Providing consistent atmospheric moisture through misting and ensuring very clean air are paramount for its health. Avoid direct sun and all conventional fertilizers as they can be harmful to this sensitive organism.

### Fertilizer
No conventional fertilizer needed; this lichen is sensitive to nutrient enrichment and air pollution. It obtains necessary trace nutrients naturally from the air and rain.
