## Care Guide
Desert wheatgrass is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and dry conditions, mirroring its native semi-arid steppe environment. It requires minimal watering once established and is well-suited to poor or average soils, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or areas with challenging growing conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally adapted to average to poor soils and does not require frequent fertilization. A light annual application of a balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in very nutrient-poor soils.
