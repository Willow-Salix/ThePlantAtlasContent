## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South America (Argentina, Uruguay, Southern Brazil) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Grassland (Pampas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun (at least 6 hours of direct sun daily is ideal for robust growth) |
| **💧 Water** | Regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry between waterings. Prefers consistent moisture but is tolerant of some drought once established; well-drained conditions are crucial to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Peanut clover thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native grassland habitat in South America. It prefers consistent moisture but tolerates some drought once established, making it quite resilient. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it requires minimal fertilization, particularly avoiding high-nitrogen types.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; as a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally does not require high-nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced fertilizer can be used if soil is very poor, but often it is unnecessary.
