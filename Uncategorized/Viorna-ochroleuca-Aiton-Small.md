## Care Guide
Thriving in its native temperate dry woodlands, Downy Clematis requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant once established, needing moderate watering and minimal fertilization. Mimic its natural habitat of open, rocky areas for best results.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer applied in early spring is sufficient, especially if planted in poor or rocky soil.
