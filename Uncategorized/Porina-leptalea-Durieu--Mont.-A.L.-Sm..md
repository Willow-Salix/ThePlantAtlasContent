## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in highly humid, low-light conditions, typical of its native forest environments. Ensure consistent moisture through high ambient humidity and occasional misting, and avoid direct sun to mimic its natural habitat on tree bark or mossy rocks.

### Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer required; obtains necessary nutrients from the air and substrate (bark, mossy rock).
