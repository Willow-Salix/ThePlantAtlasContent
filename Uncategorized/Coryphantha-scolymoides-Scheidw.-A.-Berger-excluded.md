## Introduction
Coryphantha (from Greek, "flowering on the top"), or beehive cactus, is a genus of small to middle-sized, globose or columnar cacti. The genus is native to arid parts of Central America, Mexico, through Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas and north into southwestern, central, and southeastern Montana. With its two subgenera, 57 species and 20 subspecies, it is one of the largest genera of cactus.

## Care Guide
To successfully care for this cactus, mimic its native arid environment by providing full sun and very infrequent, deep watering, ensuring excellent drainage. Fertilize sparingly only during its active growth period to support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Low; a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season.
