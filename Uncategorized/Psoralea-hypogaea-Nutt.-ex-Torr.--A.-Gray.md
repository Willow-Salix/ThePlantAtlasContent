## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (from North Carolina south to Florida and west to Louisiana and Texas) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodlands/Grasslands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, thriving best with ample direct sunlight as it naturally grows in open woodlands and sandhills. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the sandy soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Psoralea is a genus in the legume family (Fabaceae) with 121 species of shrubs, trees, and herbs native to southern and eastern Africa, ranging from Kenya to South Africa. In South Africa they are commonly referred to as fountainbush (English); fonteinbos, bloukeur, or penwortel (Afrikaans); and umHlonishwa (Zulu).

## Care Guide
Psoralea hypogaea thrives in bright, sunny conditions with excellent drainage, mimicking its native open woodland and sandhill environments. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils.

### Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; generally requires minimal or no fertilizer due to its adaptation to lean, sandy soils. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring may be applied if growth is poor.
