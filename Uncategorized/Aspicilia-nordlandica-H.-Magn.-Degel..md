## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Alpine regions of Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia) and North America |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | High light exposure, mimicking its natural habitat on exposed rocks in treeless, open environments. Tolerates cold and bright, direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent and moderate. Lichens absorb moisture from humidity, rain, and snowmelt. Allow for complete drying between moistening periods, as constant wetness is detrimental. Mimic natural, sporadic precipitation. |

## Introduction
Aspicilia (sunken disk lichen) is a genus of mostly crustose areolate lichens that grow on rock. Most members have black apothecia discs that are slightly immersed in the areolas, hence the common name"Given the same reason, the  naming of Aspicilia is derived from the Greek word for "shield concave". 
Most of the species of this genus grow on calcareous and acidic rocks and most of the taxa prefer temperate and arctic habitats.
Some members of the genus Aspicilia are pioneer species on granite and other hard rock, after which members of other lichen species may grow on them, such as members of Acarospora.

## Care Guide
This saxicolous lichen requires a harsh, exposed environment with high light and well-drained, rocky conditions. Mimic its native alpine tundra habitat by providing infrequent moisture and absolutely no supplemental nutrients, allowing it to dry out completely between moistening periods.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low to none. This lichen thrives in nutrient-poor environments, deriving sustenance from atmospheric deposition and its algal symbiont. Fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
