## 🧤 Care Instructions
This grass, though its specific name is no longer taxonomically accepted, likely thrives in conditions similar to temperate montane grasslands. It requires full sun to partial shade, moderate watering allowing for some dryness between waterings, and low to moderate fertilization to mimic its natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, primarily during the growing season, as native grasses in montane settings typically adapt to moderate soil fertility.
