## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Mexico (Oaxaca, Chiapas) and Guatemala |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Montane Forest (Cloud Forest) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade. Protect from intense, direct afternoon sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Water regularly, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly between waterings. Benefits from high ambient humidity. |

## Introduction
Hemichaena is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae.  In the 2012 restructuring of Mimulus by Barker, et al., based largely upon DNA evidence, only seven species were left in Mimulus.

## Care Guide
Hemichaena fruticosa thrives in conditions mimicking its native cloud forest habitat. Provide bright, indirect light and consistent moisture, ensuring good drainage. Maintain high humidity and offer regular, diluted fertilization during its active growth period for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half strength, every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during the cooler, darker months.
