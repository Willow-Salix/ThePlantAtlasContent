## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Coastal Plain) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Open Woodlands, Pine Flatwoods, Savannas) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade (at least 6 hours of direct sun for best flowering) |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering when young; drought-tolerant once established. Allow soil to dry between waterings, as it prefers well-drained conditions and dislikes wet feet. |

## Introduction
Baptisia (wild indigo, false indigo) is a genus in the legume family, Fabaceae. They are flowering herbaceous perennial plants with pea-like flowers, followed by pods, which are sometimes inflated. They are native to woodland and grassland in eastern and southern North America. The species most commonly found in cultivation is B. australis.
Baptisia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the jaguar flower moth, Schinia jaguarina.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, reflecting its native habitat in the open Coastal Plain. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering and fertilization. Avoid overwatering and excessive nitrogen to promote healthy growth and abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; as a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. Excessive fertilization can reduce flowering.
