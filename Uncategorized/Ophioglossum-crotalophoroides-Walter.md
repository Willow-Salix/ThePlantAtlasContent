## Introduction
Ophioglossum, the adder's-tongue ferns, is a genus of about 50 species of ferns in the family Ophioglossaceae. The genus name comes from Ancient Greek ὄφις (óphis), meaning "snake", and γλῶσσα (glôssa), meaning "tongue". Their cosmopolitan distribution is mainly in tropical and subtropical habitats.
The genus has the largest number of chromosomes in the known plant kingdom, but contrary to popular belief does not have the largest number of chromosomes out of all known organisms, falling short to the protist Sterkiella histriomuscorum.

## Care Guide
To care for Bulbous Adderstongue, provide consistently moist, well-drained soil under bright indirect light or partial shade, mimicking its humid subtropical origins. Ensure high humidity and water regularly without allowing the soil to dry out completely. Fertilize lightly during its growth period to support healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Apply a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly during the active growing season, or incorporate organic matter into the soil.
