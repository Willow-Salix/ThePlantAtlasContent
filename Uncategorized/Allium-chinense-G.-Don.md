## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | China (central and southern regions), East Asia |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Monsoon Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and bulb development, consistent with its open-field cultivation in native regions. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist during active growth (spring/summer), allowing the top inch to dry out between waterings. Reduce frequency significantly during dormancy or cooler periods to prevent bulb rot, reflecting the distinct wet/dry seasons of its native climate. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Rakkyo thrives in full sun and well-drained, fertile soil. Ensure consistent moisture during its active growth period, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and reduce watering during dormancy. A balanced fertilizer can be applied to support robust bulb development.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from fertile, well-drained soil. Apply a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season, especially if soil is poor, or incorporate compost annually to support bulb development in its naturally productive agricultural environments.
