## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (specifically Sierra Nevada foothills and southern Coast Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Woodland and Shrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Shade (prefers ample direct sun exposure consistent with open woodlands and chaparral) |
| **Watering** | Infrequent to moderate, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during its summer dormancy. Mimics its native adaptation to dry, gravelly slopes. |

## Introduction
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## Care Guide
This Delphinium species thrives in well-drained, lean soils under full sun to partial shade, adapting to the dry summers and mild, wet winters of its native Mediterranean climate. Ensure excellent drainage and avoid overwatering, especially during its summer dormancy, to mimic its natural habitat on dry, gravelly slopes.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils; excessive fertilization can harm it. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient if needed.
