## Care Guide
Polygamous Burnet is a resilient plant native to Mediterranean grasslands, preferring full sun exposure and well-drained soil. It exhibits strong drought tolerance once established, requiring infrequent watering only during extended dry spells. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it adapts well to poorer soil conditions, making it an excellent low-maintenance choice for sunny, dry garden areas.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in moderately fertile to poor, well-drained soils. Supplemental fertilizer is generally not required, but a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial in very lean soils.
