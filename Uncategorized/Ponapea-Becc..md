## Care Guide
This tropical palm thrives in bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. High humidity is crucial, reflecting its native rainforest environment in Micronesia. Feed with a balanced fertilizer during its active growing season to support robust health.

### Fertilizer
Regular fertilization with a balanced, slow-release or liquid fertilizer during the growing season, as tropical soils are often rich in organic matter but can also experience nutrient leaching.
