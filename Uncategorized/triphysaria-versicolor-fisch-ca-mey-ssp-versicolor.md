## 🧤 Care Instructions
Yellowbeak Owl's-Clover thrives in full sun with consistent moisture during its winter and spring growing season. Being a hemi-parasite, it has low fertilizer needs. It is an annual plant that naturally dies back in the hot, dry summer, completing its life cycle.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a hemi-parasitic plant, it derives nutrients from host plants; excessive fertilization may not be necessary and could potentially interfere with its natural growth cycle. A balanced, dilute fertilizer applied sparingly during active growth, if at all, is sufficient.
