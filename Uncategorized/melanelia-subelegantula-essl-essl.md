## 🌱 Overview
Melanelia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. These lichens typically grow on rocks and form relatively large, leaf-like structures with brown to blackish upper surfaces and pale undersides. The genus originally included many more species, but most have since been moved to related genera like Melanohalea and Melanelixia, leaving only five accepted species today.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in cool, moist, and clean air environments characteristic of temperate boreal and montane forests. Provide high humidity and filtered light, ensuring it avoids direct, harsh sun. Do not use soil or traditional fertilizers, as it absorbs nutrients from the air and precipitation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from airborne particles, dust, and precipitation. Highly sensitive to air pollution.
