## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mexico (specifically montane, humid regions) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Montane Forest / Subtropical Cloud Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Filtered to moderate indirect light; avoid intense, direct sun that could lead to desiccation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lecanora perradiata, a lichen, thrives in environments with high atmospheric humidity and filtered light, typical of montane cloud forests. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and rain, eliminating the need for traditional watering or fertilization, but making it highly sensitive to air quality.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required; this lichen obtains all necessary nutrients directly from the air and rainwater and is sensitive to pollutants.
