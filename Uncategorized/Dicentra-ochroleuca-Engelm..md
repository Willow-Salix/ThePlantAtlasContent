## Introduction
Dicentra (Greek dís "twice", kéntron "spur"), known collectively as the bleeding-hearts, is a genus containing eight species of herbaceous flowering perennial plants with unique, "heart"-shaped flowers and finely divided foliage. The species are, primarily, native to North America, although several are found in temperate East Asia.

## Care Guide
Creamy Bleeding Heart thrives in conditions mirroring its native Southern California chaparral, preferring full sun to partial shade and very well-draining, sandy or rocky soils. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established, and benefits from minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light, balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or none if soil is naturally poor to moderately fertile.
