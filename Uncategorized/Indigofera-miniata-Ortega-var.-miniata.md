## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring well-draining soil and moderate watering, allowing drying out between sessions. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it has low to moderate fertilizer needs. It is well-suited to conditions mimicking its native tropical and subtropical savanna-like environment.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive nitrogen fertilization is not required. A balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the active growth period is sufficient if soil is poor.
