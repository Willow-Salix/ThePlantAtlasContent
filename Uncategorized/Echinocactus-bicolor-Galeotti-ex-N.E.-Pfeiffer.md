## Introduction
Echinocactus is a genus of cacti in the subfamily Cactoideae. The generic name derives from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echînos), meaning "spiny," and cactus.  It and Ferocactus are the two genera of barrel cactus.  Members of the genus usually have heavy spination and relatively small flowers.  The fruits are copiously woolly, and this is one major distinction between Echinocactus and Ferocactus.  Propagation is by seed.

## Care Guide
This desert-native cactus thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, tolerating long periods of drought. Ensure excellent drainage and provide a light feeding during its growing season for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Apply a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus-specific fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
