## Introduction
Tradescantia () is a genus of 85 species of herbaceous perennial wildflowers in the family Commelinaceae, native to the Americas from southern Canada to northern Argentina, including the West Indies. Members of the genus are known by many common names, including inchplant, wandering jew, spiderwort, dayflower and trad.
Tradescantia grow 30–60 cm  tall (1–2 ft), and are commonly found individually or in clumps in wooded areas and open fields. They were introduced into Europe as ornamental plants in the 17th century and are now grown in many parts of the world. Some species have become naturalized in regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and on some oceanic islands.
The genus's many species are of interest to cytogenetics because of evolutionary changes in the structure and number of their chromosomes. They have also been used as bioindicators for the detection of environmental mutagens. Some species have become pests to cultivated crops and considered invasive.

## Care Guide
Virginia Spiderwort thrives in bright indirect light to partial shade, mimicking its native woodland environment. Maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil, allowing the top layer to dry slightly between waterings, and fertilize lightly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding during the active growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer.
