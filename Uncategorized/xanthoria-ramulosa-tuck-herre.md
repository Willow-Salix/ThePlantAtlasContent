## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in bright, exposed conditions with good air circulation. Provide intermittent moisture through misting or natural rainfall, ensuring it dries out completely between periods of wetness. No fertilizer is needed, as it gathers nutrients from its environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No fertilizer required. Lichens obtain nutrients from airborne particles and rain; conventional fertilizers are harmful.
