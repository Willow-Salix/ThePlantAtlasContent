## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mexico, Central America, West Indies, and northern South America (e.g., Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and moist montane forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light; avoid direct, harsh sun which can scorch leaves, mimicking their natural understory habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged; allow the top layer of substrate to dry slightly between waterings, reflecting the frequent rainfall and good drainage of their native environment. High humidity is crucial. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Beloglottis orchids thrive in conditions mimicking their native tropical rainforest understory. Provide consistently moist (but not soggy) substrate, high humidity, and low to medium indirect light to encourage healthy growth. Fertilize moderately during active growth periods to support their nutrient needs.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization with a diluted (e.g., 1/4 strength) orchid-specific fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during active growth, as they would naturally receive nutrients from decaying organic matter.
