## 🧤 Care Instructions
Holmgren's Lupine thrives in full sun and dry conditions, mirroring its native arid scrubland habitat. Provide it with ample sunlight and water infrequently but deeply, ensuring the soil dries out completely. Avoid over-fertilizing, particularly with nitrogen, as it's adapted to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer required, especially nitrogen, due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities and adaptation to lean, arid soils.
