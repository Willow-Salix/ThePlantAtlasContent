## Care Guide
This resilient legume thrives in full sun with moderate, consistent watering in well-drained soil. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it requires little to no fertilizer, making it a low-maintenance choice for its native climate.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it naturally enriches the soil and typically thrives in average to poor soils without supplemental nutrients.
