## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | The parent species originate from Central and East Asia (Ulmus pumila) and Eastern North America (Ulmus rubra). |
| **Climate** | Temperate climates, encompassing both the semi-arid steppes and temperate deciduous forests of its parent species' native ranges. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun for robust growth, but can tolerate partial shade, particularly in very hot climates. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate and consistent moisture in well-drained soil. Once established, it demonstrates good drought tolerance but performs best with regular watering. |

## Introduction
Elms are deciduous and semi-deciduous trees comprising the genus Ulmus in the family Ulmaceae. They are distributed over most of the Northern Hemisphere, inhabiting the temperate and tropical-montane regions of North America and Eurasia, ranging southward in Western Asia to Iran, in Africa to Libya, and in Southeast Asia into Indonesia.
Elms are components of many kinds of natural forests. Moreover, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, many species and cultivars were also planted as ornamental street, garden, and park trees in Europe, North America, and parts of the Southern Hemisphere, notably Australasia. Some individual elms reached great size and age. However, in recent decades, most mature elms of European or North American origin have died from Dutch elm disease, caused by a microfungus dispersed by bark beetles. In response, disease-resistant cultivars have been developed, capable of restoring the elm to forestry and landscaping.

## Care Guide
The Hybrid Elm thrives in full sun with moderate, consistent watering in well-drained soil, showing good drought tolerance once established. Provide an annual balanced fertilizer application to support healthy growth. It is adaptable to various temperate conditions.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate soil fertility. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is beneficial, especially in less fertile soils.
