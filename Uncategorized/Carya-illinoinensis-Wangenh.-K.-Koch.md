## Introduction
The pecan ( pih-KAN, also US:  pih-KAHN, PEE-kan, UK:  PEE-kən; Carya illinoinensis) is a species of hickory native to the Southern United States and northern Mexico in the region of the Mississippi River. 
Originally native to the south-central U.S., the tree is cultivated for its seed primarily in the U.S. states of Georgia, New Mexico, and Texas, Louisiana and in Mexico. The seed is an edible nut used as a snack and in various recipes, such as praline candy and pecan pie. The pecan is the state nut of Alabama, Arkansas, California, Texas, and Louisiana, and is also the state tree of Texas.

## Care Guide
The Pecan tree thrives in full sun and demands consistently moist, well-drained, and nutrient-rich soil, mirroring its native humid subtropical river bottom habitat. Ample water is crucial, particularly during its active growing season, to ensure robust growth and a bountiful nut harvest.

### Fertilizer
Requires moderately rich to rich, well-draining soil. Benefits from a balanced fertilizer application, particularly in early spring and mid-summer, to support vigorous growth and nut yield.
