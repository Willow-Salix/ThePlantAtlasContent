## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and South America (specifically Neotropical regions) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest and Moist Tropical Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial sun. While young, they may tolerate more shade, but mature trees typically require good light exposure. |
| **Watering** | Consistent and frequent watering is essential to keep the soil consistently moist, mimicking rainforest conditions, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Hieronyma is a genus in the plant family Phyllanthaceae. It was first described as a genus in 1848. This family was formerly united with spurges, crotons, copperleaves, etc. (Euphorbiaceae), but have turned out to be well distinct. The genus is native to South America, Central America, southern Mexico, and the West Indies. It is dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants.
The spelling Hieronyma has been conserved; the spellings Hieronima and Hyeronima are spelling variants of this name.
Hieronyma is used locally as a foodplant, e.g. by the Nukak of Guaviare Department in the Amazon natural region of Colombia. Several species are threatened by deforestation.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical rainforest origin, requiring consistently moist, well-draining soil and bright, indirect to partial sun. Provide moderate fertilization during its growth periods to support its development as a robust tree.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the active growing season with a balanced liquid or slow-release fertilizer will support vigorous growth, given the nutrient cycling in their native habitat.
