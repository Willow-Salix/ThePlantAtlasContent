## Care Guide
This resilient desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal water once established, favoring well-draining, poor soils. Avoid overwatering and excessive fertilization to ensure its health and vigor, especially during dry periods.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be detrimental.
