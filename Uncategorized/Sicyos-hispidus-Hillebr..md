## Care Guide
This Hawaiian endemic thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical mesic to wet forest habitat, requiring consistent moisture and good drainage. Provide partial to dappled sunlight and regular, diluted fertilization during active growth to support its vigorous vining habit.

### Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler, dormant periods.
