## Care Guide
Douglas' Ragwort is a hardy plant that flourishes in bright, sunny conditions, mimicking its native arid environment. Provide ample sunlight and allow the soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings to prevent root rot. Minimal fertilization is needed.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. A diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season, but it generally tolerates poor soils.
