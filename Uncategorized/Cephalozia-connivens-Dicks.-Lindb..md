## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in consistently moist, acidic conditions with very high ambient humidity, mimicking its native bog and wetland habitats. Provide partial to full shade and ensure the substrate never dries out, while avoiding significant fertilization due to its low nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none; native bog environments are nutrient-poor, so over-fertilization can be detrimental. If used, apply a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly and infrequently.
