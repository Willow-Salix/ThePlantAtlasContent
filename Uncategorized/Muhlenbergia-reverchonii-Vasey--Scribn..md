## Introduction
Muhlenbergia is a genus of plants in the grass family.
The genus is named in honor of the German-American amateur botanist Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg (1753-1815). Many of the species are known by the common name muhly.
The greatest number are native to the southwestern United States and Mexico, but there are also native species in Canada, Central and South America and in Asia.

## Care Guide
Seep Muhly is a resilient, low-maintenance grass that thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring only moderate watering during extended dry periods or active growth. Avoid rich soils and excessive fertilization to maintain its natural, compact form.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Native to lean, rocky, or average prairie soils, it does not require rich fertilization. Excessive fertilizer can lead to floppy growth.
