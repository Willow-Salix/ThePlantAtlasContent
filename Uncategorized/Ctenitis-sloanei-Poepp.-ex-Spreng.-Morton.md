## Care Guide
The Florida Lacefern thrives in conditions that mimic its native tropical forest floor, requiring consistent moisture, high humidity, and low to medium indirect light. Ensure well-draining soil that never completely dries out, and provide light, diluted fertilization during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Lightly fertilize with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer).
