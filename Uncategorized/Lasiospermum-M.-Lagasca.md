## Care Guide
Cocoonhead thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its semi-arid grassland origins. It is a drought-tolerant plant, requiring infrequent watering where the soil completely dries out between sessions. Minimal fertilization is needed for this resilient species.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year during the active growing season, primarily in nutrient-poor soils.
