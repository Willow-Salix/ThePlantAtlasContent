| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Rocky areas across temperate and boreal regions of North America and Europe, including alpine and subalpine zones. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Montane/Alpine, characterized by exposed, rocky environments. |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure, tolerant of direct sunlight. Thrives in open, bright locations on rock surfaces. |
| **Watering** | Requires moisture from atmospheric humidity, rain, and dew; tolerates prolonged dry periods, rehydrating quickly upon moisture availability. No traditional watering as it's a lichen. |

## Care Guide
As a lichen, Aspilicia cinereorufescens thrives on exposed siliceous rocks in temperate to boreal montane climates. It requires high light, clean air, and moisture from ambient humidity or rainfall, tolerating cycles of wet and dry. Traditional plant care like watering or fertilizing is not applicable.

### Fertilizer
None. Obtains nutrients from atmospheric deposition and the substrate (rock) itself. Sensitive to pollutants.
