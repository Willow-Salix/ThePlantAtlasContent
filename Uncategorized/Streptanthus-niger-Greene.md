## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tiburon Peninsula, Marin County, California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (Arid Scrubland/Grassland on serpentine soils) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, particularly in its natural open grassland and oak woodland habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growing season (winter/spring), allowing soil to dry completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water during dry periods or after setting seed. |

## Introduction
Streptanthus glandulosus subsp. niger is an endangered subspecies of flowering plant within the family Brassicaceae. Like other genus members, this herb has wavy petal margins with perimeter calluses that discourage larval herbivory. This plant is endemic to the Tiburon Peninsula of Northern California, and occurs at elevations below 150 m on serpentine grasslands. The common name for this subspecies is Tiburon jewelflower or black jewelflower. This annual herb blooms in May and June and displays dark purple sepals. The etymology of this genus scientific name derives from the Greek word streptanthus, meaning twisted flower, with reference to the notable wavy margins of the petals. The subspecies name niger relates to the color of the seeds being black, although an alternate account cites the dark color of the petals as the source of the appellation.

## Care Guide
The Tiburon Jewelflower thrives in full sun to partial shade within well-draining, nutrient-poor soils, ideally mimicking its native serpentine habitat. Provide moderate water during its winter/spring growth period, ensuring the soil dries out between waterings. Fertilization is generally not needed and can be harmful.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor serpentine soils, and excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
