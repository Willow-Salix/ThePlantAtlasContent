## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and South America, including countries like Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light. As an understory plant in dense tropical forests, it thrives with filtered or dappled sunlight and should be protected from direct, harsh sun. |
| **💧 Water** | High and consistent moisture. Requires frequent watering to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, mimicking its native rainforest habitat. High humidity is also crucial, benefiting from misting or a pebble tray. |

## 🌱 Overview
Asplenium is a genus of about 700 species of ferns, often treated as the only genus in the family Aspleniaceae, though other authors consider Hymenasplenium separate, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, a different chromosome count, and structural differences in the rhizomes. The type species for the genus is Asplenium marinum.
The most common vernacular name is spleenworts, applied to the more "typical" species. A. nidus and several similar species are called bird's-nest ferns, the Camptosorus group is known as walking ferns, and distinct names are applied to some other particularly well-known species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Asplenium integerrimum, provide a consistently moist environment with high humidity and protect it from direct sunlight. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot, and offer light fertilization during active growth to mimic its tropical rainforest origins.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Native rainforest soils can be nutrient-rich from decaying organic matter, but as a fern, it is not a heavy feeder. Use a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly during the growing season (e.g., once a month).
