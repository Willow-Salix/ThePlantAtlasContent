## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous and Coniferous Forests (understory) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to very low indirect light, mimicking the forest floor under dense canopy. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist, never allowing the substrate to dry out. High ambient humidity is crucial for its health. |

## Care Guide
This moss requires conditions similar to its native forest understory, meaning very low, indirect light and consistently high humidity. Its substrate must be kept uniformly moist, as it is highly sensitive to drying out. Fertilization is rarely needed and should be minimal.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer; if applied, use a highly diluted, balanced liquid solution (e.g., for epiphytes) once or twice a year at most.
