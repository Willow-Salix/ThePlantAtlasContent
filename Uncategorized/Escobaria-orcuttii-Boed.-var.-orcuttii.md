| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Mexico (specifically Coahuila) and adjacent southwestern United States (Texas) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Chihuahuan Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to very bright indirect light. Requires significant direct sunlight to maintain compact growth and encourage flowering. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly or stop during winter dormancy. |

## Introduction
Pelecyphora, pincushion cactus or foxtail cactus is a genus of cacti, comprising 20 species. They originate from Mexico and the United States.
Common species include the Missouri foxtail cactus P. missouriensis, widespread in grassland and forest west of the Mississippi, and the spinystar P. vivipara, distributed across the US and into Canada, first described by Nuttall in 1813.

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its arid native habitat. Water deeply but infrequently, ensuring the soil completely dries out between applications, and significantly reduce watering in winter. Fertilize sparingly with a low-nitrogen formula during its spring and summer growing period.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Apply a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer), avoiding fertilization in fall and winter.
