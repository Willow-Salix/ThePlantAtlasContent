## Care Guide
Bailey's Ivesia is a hardy subalpine plant requiring full sun and excellent drainage. Mimic its native dry, rocky slopes by watering infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to completely dry out. Minimal to no fertilization is necessary, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in poor, rocky soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once a year in spring.
