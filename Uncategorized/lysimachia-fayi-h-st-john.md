## 🧤 Care Instructions
This species thrives in very wet conditions, requiring consistently moist to saturated soil, even tolerating standing water for periods. It performs best in full to partial sun and needs only light fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor, sandy native habitats.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization, as its native pineland soils are typically nutrient-poor. An annual light application of balanced fertilizer is usually sufficient.
