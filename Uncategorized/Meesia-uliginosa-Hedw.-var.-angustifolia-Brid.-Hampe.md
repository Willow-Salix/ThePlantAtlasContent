## Introduction
Meesia is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Meesiaceae. The genus has cosmopolitan distribution.
The genus name of Meesia is in honour of David Meese (1723–1770), who was a Dutch botanist, notable for his authorship of the Flora frisica in 1760.
The genus was first described by Johann Hedwig in 1801.

## Care Guide
This circumboreal bog-moss thrives in cool, constantly wet, and often nutrient-poor environments. Provide bright indirect to moderate light, ensuring the substrate remains saturated and humidity is consistently high to mimic its native bog and tundra habitats.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; if fertilized, use a very dilute, balanced solution sparingly.
