## Care Guide
Hooker's Silene thrives in bright conditions with well-drained, lean soil, mimicking its native open, rocky woodlands. Water sparingly, only when the soil is completely dry, and avoid over-fertilization to prevent root rot and encourage robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Prefers lean, well-draining soils and does not require rich, heavily amended conditions.
