## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South and Central America (especially Andes and Amazonian regions), parts of Africa, and Oceania |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Rainforest / Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can scorch the delicate thallus, mimicking its understory or epiphytic habitat. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged. High ambient humidity is crucial, requiring frequent misting or cultivation in a terrarium-like environment. |

## Introduction
Leptoscyphus is a genus of liverwort in the family Lophocoleaceae. 
It has an almost cosmopolitan distribution, except central mainland Europe, most parts of Asia and parts of north America where it is not found.

## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in consistently moist, highly humid conditions with low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native tropical montane rainforest habitat. Provide regular moisture, high ambient humidity, and very infrequent, highly diluted fertilization for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/8 to 1/4 strength) infrequently, typically once every 2-3 months, as epiphytic plants derive nutrients from rain and decaying matter.
