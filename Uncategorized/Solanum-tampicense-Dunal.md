## Introduction
Solanum is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants, which include three food crops of high economic importance: the potato, the tomato and the eggplant (aubergine, brinjal). It is the largest genus in the nightshade family Solanaceae, comprising around 1,500 species. It also contains the so-called horse nettles (unrelated to the genus of true nettles, Urtica), as well as numerous plants cultivated for their ornamental flowers and fruit.
Solanum species show a wide range of growth habits, such as annuals and perennials, vines, subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees. Many formerly independent genera like Lycopersicon (the tomatoes) and Cyphomandra are now included in Solanum as subgenera or sections. Thus, the genus today contains roughly 1,500–2,000 species.

## Care Guide
This subtropical scrambling vine thrives in warm temperatures and high humidity. Provide bright indirect to full sun and ensure the soil remains consistently moist. Regular fertilization during active growth will support its vigorous habit.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high nutrient requirements. Fertilize regularly during the growing season (spring through fall) with a balanced liquid fertilizer.
