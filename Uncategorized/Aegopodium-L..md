## Introduction
Aegopodium podagraria, commonly called ground elder, is a species of flowering plant in the carrot family Apiaceae that grows in shady places. The name "ground elder" comes from the superficial similarity of its leaves and flowers to those of elder (Sambucus), which is not closely related. Other common names include herb gerard, bishop's weed, goutweed, gout wort, snow-in-the-mountain, English masterwort and wild masterwort. It is the type species of the genus Aegopodium. It is native to Europe and Asia, but has been introduced around the world as an ornamental plant, where it occasionally poses an ecological threat as an invasive exotic plant.

## Care Guide
Goutweed thrives in cool, shady locations with consistently moist soil, mimicking its native temperate woodland environment. While it is adaptable and can tolerate average soil, regular watering is crucial, especially in drier climates. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its vigorous growth habit.

### Fertilizer
Not a heavy feeder. A light application of balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring is sufficient, especially if growth seems weak. Thrives even in poor to average soil.
