## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mountainous regions of Europe (e.g., Alps, Carpathians, Pyrenees) and parts of temperate Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Alpine/Subalpine Grasslands and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. This plant is adapted to open, high-altitude environments, suggesting it thrives with ample light, especially in cooler climates. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil is crucial, mimicking its native habitat in mountain meadows. It tolerates brief dry periods but should not be allowed to dry out completely or sit in waterlogged conditions. |

## Introduction
Luzula campestris, commonly known as field wood-rush or Good Friday grass  is a flowering plant in the rush family Juncaceae. It is also one of the plants known as chimney sweeps  or sweep's broom because of the brush-like appearance of their flowers. This is a very common plant throughout temperate Europe extending to the Caucasus. This species of Luzula is found on all types of native grasslands, and cultivated areas such as lawns, golf-course greens and fields.

## Care Guide
This alpine variety of Field Wood-rush flourishes in cool, bright conditions found in mountain grasslands. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and prefers ample light from full sun to partial shade. Fertilization should be minimal, reflecting its adaptation to less fertile native environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Native mountain soils are often not exceptionally rich, so a light application of a balanced fertilizer once annually in spring is typically sufficient, or none if grown in good quality soil.
