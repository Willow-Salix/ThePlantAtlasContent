## Care Guide
Spoonleaf Rockcress thrives in bright, cool conditions, mirroring its native mountain habitat. Ensure it receives full to partial sun and is planted in well-draining, lean soil to prevent root rot. Water moderately, allowing the soil surface to dry out between applications, and apply fertilizer very sparingly.

### Fertilizer
Low (native soils in montane and alpine regions are typically lean and well-drained, requiring minimal supplemental nutrients)
