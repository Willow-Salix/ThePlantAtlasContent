## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caribbean (e.g., Cuba, West Indies) and parts of Mexico |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid Scrubland or Tropical Dry Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential for robust growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow the soil to completely dry out between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant, overwatering can cause rot. |

## Introduction
Opuntia, commonly called the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family Cactaceae, many known for their flavorful fruit and showy flowers. Cacti are native to the Americas, and are well adapted to arid climates; however, they are still vulnerable to alterations in precipitation and temperature driven by climate change. The plant has been introduced to Australia, southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.
Prickly pear alone is also used to refer to the fruit, but may also be used for the plant itself; in addition, other names given to the plant and its specific parts include tuna (fruit), sabra, sabbar, nopal (pads, plural nopales, from the Nahuatl word nōpalli), nostle (fruit) from the Nahuatl word nōchtli, and paddle cactus. The genus is named for the Ancient Greek city of Opus. The fruit and leaves are edible. The most common culinary species is the "Barbary fig" (Opuntia ficus-indica).
In places where they have been introduced outside their native range, some species in the genus Opuntia behave as aggressive invasive species.

## Care Guide
Elephantear pricklypear thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, as it's highly adapted to arid conditions. Fertilize sparingly during the growing season with a diluted, low-nitrogen formula to support healthy growth without encouraging lush, weak pads.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; a low-nitrogen, high-potassium fertilizer diluted to half strength once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
