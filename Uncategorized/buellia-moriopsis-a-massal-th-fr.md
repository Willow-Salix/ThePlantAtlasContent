## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal and high-altitude exposed rocky environments across temperate, boreal, and polar regions (e.g., Europe, North America, Arctic, Antarctic) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Exposed Rocky Maritime and Alpine Zones (Temperate to Polar) |
| **☀️ Light** | High, direct sun exposure. Thrives in open, unsheltered locations on rock surfaces. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies entirely on natural atmospheric moisture (rain, fog, dew). Requires cycles of hydration followed by complete desiccation. |

## 🌱 Overview
Buellia is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Caliciaceae. The fungi are usually part of a crustose lichen. In this case, the lichen species is given the same name as the fungus. But members may also grow as parasites on lichens (lichenicolous). The algae in the lichen (the photobiont partner) is always a member of the genus Trebouxia.
Lichens in the genus are commonly called disc lichens, or button lichens. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains almost 1000 species.
Genetic studies indicate that the genus Amandinea and Buellia may be the same, although this is not widely accepted.
The genus Buellia was described by Italian botanist Gioseppe De Notaris in 1846 and named after his friend, Esperanzo Buelli.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Buellia moriopsis is a lichen that thrives in harsh, exposed rocky environments with high light exposure and natural moisture cycles. It requires no human intervention for watering or fertilization, deriving all needs from the atmosphere and rainwater. Maintaining clean air is paramount for its well-being.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
None. This lichen acquires all necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition and rainwater; artificial fertilization is detrimental.
