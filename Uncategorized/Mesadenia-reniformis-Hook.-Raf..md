## Introduction
Arnoglossum is a North American genus of plants in the family Asteraceae, described as a genus in 1817. They have the common name Indian plantain because they resemble the unrelated common plantain (Plantago spp.).
Arnoglossum is a member of the tribe Senecioneae which has been undergoing extensive revisions in recent years. Many of the species now in the genus were formerly classified in other genera such as Cacalia, Mesadenia, and Senecio. The remaining species are all native to North America (Ontario and eastern United States).
The name Arnoglossum is from the Greek word "arnos" meaning lamb, and "glossum" meaning tongue and is the  ancient name for some species of Plantago.

## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its humid montane forest origin, requiring bright indirect light and consistent moisture with excellent drainage. Fertilize sparingly during active growth to promote healthy foliage and potential blooms.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced orchid-specific fertilizer diluted to half strength during its active growing season (spring and summer).
