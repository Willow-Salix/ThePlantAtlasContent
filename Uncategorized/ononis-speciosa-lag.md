## 🌱 Overview
Ononis is a genus of 80–90 species of perennial herbs and subshrubs in the legume family Fabaceae. The members of this genus are called restharrows; an old spelling "wrestharrows" is also recorded from 1965. as some species grow as weeds on arable lands where their tough roots would catch and stop the harrow. The genus is native to Europe, northern and eastern Africa, and western and central Asia.
In herbalism restharrow is used to treat bladder and kidney problems and water retention.
The active ingredients in restharrow are essential oils, flavonoid-glycosides, and tannins.
Restharrows are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the grey pug and Coleophora ononidella (which feeds exclusively on O. arvensis).
