## 🌱 Overview
Pankration (; Ancient Greek: παγκράτιον [paŋkráti.on]) was an unarmed combat sport introduced into the Greek Olympic Games in 648 BC. The athletes used boxing and wrestling techniques but also others, such as kicking, holds, joint locks, and chokes on the ground, making it similar to modern mixed martial arts. The term comes from the Ancient Greek word παγκράτιον (pankrátion), meaning "all of power" (from  παν- (pan-) 'all-' and  κράτος (krátos) 'strength, might, power').

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This aquatic to semi-aquatic plant thrives in full sun and requires consistently wet to submerged conditions, mimicking its native river shoals habitat. Moderate fertilization supports healthy growth, making constant moisture the most critical care factor.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
