## Care Guide
Crossandra thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical forest understory, requiring bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. High humidity is crucial for its health, and regular feeding during the growing season will promote abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
