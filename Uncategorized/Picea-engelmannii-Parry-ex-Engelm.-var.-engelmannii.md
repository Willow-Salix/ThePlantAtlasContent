## Care Guide
Engelmann spruce requires a cool, moist environment reminiscent of its native subalpine forests. Provide full sun, consistently moist but well-drained soil, and avoid high heat or drought. Minimal fertilization is typically needed.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Native soils are typically not overly rich. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly if soil nutrients are poor.
