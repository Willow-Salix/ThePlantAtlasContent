## Care Guide
This resilient native grass thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-draining soil. It is relatively low-maintenance, requiring moderate watering and minimal fertilization once established, making it suitable for naturalized areas or meadows.

### Fertilizer
Low. Generally adapted to nutrient-poor or average soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary.
