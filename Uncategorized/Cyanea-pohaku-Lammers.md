## Care Guide
This critically endangered Hawaiian plant needs conditions similar to its native tropical wet forest. Provide bright, indirect light and maintain consistently moist, well-draining soil with very high humidity. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted, balanced feed during periods of active growth.

### Fertilizer
Use a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season; native soils are often nutrient-rich but can be leached.
