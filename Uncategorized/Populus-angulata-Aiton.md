## Care Guide
This fast-growing tree thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native riparian habitats. Ensure adequate water, especially when young, and provide ample space for its large growth.

### Fertilizer
Generally low. Can benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in poor soils or for young, establishing trees. Established trees rarely require fertilization.
