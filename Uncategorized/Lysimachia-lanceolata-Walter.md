## Care Guide
Lanceleaf Loosestrife thrives in temperate conditions, requiring partial to full sun exposure and consistently moist soil. Regular watering is key to its success, especially in full sun or during dry spells. An annual light feeding supports vigorous growth, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant adapted to its native climate's varying conditions.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate; an annual application of balanced, all-purpose fertilizer or compost in spring can be beneficial, particularly in poor soils.
