## Care Guide
This moss thrives in consistently moist to saturated conditions, mimicking its native bog and fen habitats. Provide partial to full shade and high ambient humidity, while ensuring very low nutrient input to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low; naturally grows in nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and fens. Avoid rich fertilizers, which can be detrimental.
