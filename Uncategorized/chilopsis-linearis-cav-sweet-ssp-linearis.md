## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Desert Willow thrives in full sun and dry conditions, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping. It requires infrequent, deep watering once established and generally needs minimal fertilization, adapting well to poor desert soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Generally not required once established in suitable soil; if needed, a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring.
