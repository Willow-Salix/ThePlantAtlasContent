## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Florida, Georgia, South Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Low to Moderate, Indirect Light (Partial to Full Shade) |
| **Watering** | High humidity is crucial; thrives on consistent moisture from air and occasional rainfall, but requires no standing water as it's an epiphytic lichen. |

## Introduction
Opegrapha is a genus of mostly lichen-forming fungi in the family Opegraphaceae. These lichens form crusty patches on bark, rock, or other lichens, and are easily recognized by their distinctive black, slit-like or rounded fruiting bodies that look like tiny scribbles or dashes on the surface. The genus includes more than 100 species found worldwide, with most partnering with orange-pigmented green algae, though some live as parasites on other lichens.

## Care Guide
Opegrapha Ravenelii is an epiphytic lichen thriving in the high humidity and indirect light of humid subtropical forests in the Southeastern U.S. It requires no soil or traditional fertilization, obtaining nutrients from its environment. Maintaining consistent high humidity is key to its care, rather than direct watering of a substrate.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed; nutrients are absorbed from the air, rainwater, and microscopic organic matter on its host surface.
