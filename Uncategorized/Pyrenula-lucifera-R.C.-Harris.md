| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to partial shade, replicating its natural habitat on tree trunks beneath a forest canopy. |
| **Watering** | Requires high ambient humidity and consistent moisture from the air and rainfall. Traditional watering is not applicable; regular misting or placement in a humid environment is essential. |

## Care Guide
As an epiphyte from humid subtropical forests, Wart Lichen thrives in environments with high humidity and indirect light. It primarily absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rainfall, therefore requiring consistent ambient moisture rather than traditional watering or fertilization, which can be harmful.

### Fertilizer
Not required. Lichens derive nutrients from the air and rain, and are sensitive to synthetic fertilizers.
