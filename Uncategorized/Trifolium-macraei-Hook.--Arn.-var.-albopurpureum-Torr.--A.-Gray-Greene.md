## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA and Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland/Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, tolerating intense direct sunlight in its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growing season (typically spring and early summer); drought-tolerant once established, preferring dry conditions during summer dormancy. |

## Introduction
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## Care Guide
This clover thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. Water moderately during its growing season, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, as it becomes drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization is generally not needed due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it naturally fixes nitrogen, thriving in nutrient-poor to moderately fertile soils without supplemental fertilization.
