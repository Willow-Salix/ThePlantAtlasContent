## Care Guide
The Prairie Lily, adapted to its native grasslands, requires full sun and well-drained soil to thrive. Water moderately during its growing season, letting the soil dry out, and expect blooms following significant rainfall. Fertilize sparingly in early spring.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied once in early spring. Avoid over-fertilization.
