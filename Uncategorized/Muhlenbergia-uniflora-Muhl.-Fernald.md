## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, including southeastern Canada (e.g., Quebec, Nova Scotia, Ontario) and the northeastern United States (e.g., New England, Great Lakes states, Appalachian states). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Bog and Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Sun. This plant thrives in the open, unshaded conditions typical of bogs and fens, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to moist soil. As a bog plant, it requires constantly saturated or waterlogged conditions and will not tolerate drying out. Replicate bog-like moisture levels. |

## Introduction
Muhlenbergia is a genus of plants in the grass family.
The genus is named in honor of the German-American amateur botanist Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg (1753-1815). Many of the species are known by the common name muhly.
The greatest number are native to the southwestern United States and Mexico, but there are also native species in Canada, Central and South America and in Asia.

## Care Guide
Bog Muhly thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently wet to waterlogged soil to mimic its native bog habitat. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic conditions, making supplemental fertilization largely unnecessary and potentially harmful. Maintain high moisture levels to ensure its success.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native bog environments are typically nutrient-poor, acidic soils, so this plant is adapted to low nutrient levels. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
