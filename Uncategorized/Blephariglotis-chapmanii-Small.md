## Quick Facts

| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi coastal plain) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Wet Pine Flatwoods and Bogs |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, mimicking open bog or savanna environments. |

## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid requires consistently wet, acidic soil and high humidity, mirroring its native wet pine flatwoods and bog habitats. Provide full to partial sun exposure and apply only very diluted fertilizers sparingly to prevent root damage.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, diluted formula during the active growing season. Over-fertilization should be avoided as it is accustomed to nutrient-poor bog conditions.
