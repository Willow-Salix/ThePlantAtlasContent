## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert-adapted perennial thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, tolerating significant drought. Plant in well-draining, lean soil, and avoid over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen, due to its natural nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization is required. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen. If necessary, use a very diluted, low-nitrogen, general-purpose fertilizer sparingly in very poor soils.
