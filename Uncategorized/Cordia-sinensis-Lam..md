## Introduction
Cordia is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. It contains 228 species of shrubs and trees, that are found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Many of the species are commonly called manjack, while bocote may refer to several Central American species in Spanish.
The generic name honours German botanist and pharmacist Valerius Cordus (1515–1544). Like most other Boraginaceae, the majority have trichomes (hairs) on the leaves.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering once established. It has minimal fertilizer requirements, adapting well to less fertile soils typical of its native semi-arid and savanna environments.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring is generally sufficient, especially in poorer soils.
