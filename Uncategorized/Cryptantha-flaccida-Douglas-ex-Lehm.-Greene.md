## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, including British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona |
| **Climate** | Arid and Semi-Arid Scrublands, Grasslands, and Dry Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily). This plant thrives in open, exposed environments. |
| **Watering** | Low; highly drought-tolerant. Allow the soil to dry out completely between very infrequent, deep waterings. Overwatering is detrimental. |

## Introduction
Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat's eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus Plagiobothrys, and members of the subtribe of Amsinckiinae). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.
These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

## Care Guide
The Weakstem Cryptantha thrives in conditions mirroring its native arid scrublands, requiring full sun and very minimal watering. It prefers poor, well-draining soils and should not be over-fertilized, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or rock gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to lean, poor, and sandy or rocky soils characteristic of its native habitats. Fertilization is generally unnecessary and can be harmful.
