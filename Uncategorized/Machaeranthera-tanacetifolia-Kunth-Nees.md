## Introduction
Machaeranthera is a genus of North American flowering plants in the family Asteraceae which are known by the common name tansyaster.
Tansyasters are variable in appearance. Some are small, singular wildflowers, while others are sprawling shrubs. Several species easily hybridize with each other, as well, making identification difficult. In general, members of the genus may be identified by the sharp-pointed, dagger-shaped anthers in the disc florets at the center of the flower. The flower heads are usually daisylike, and are usually a shade of purple or blue, but may be pink, yellow, or white. Tansyasters are native to western North America.
The genus Machaeranthera is distinguished from the genus Dieteria by having once- or twice-pinnate leaves, whereas Dieteria has entire to toothed leaves.
Machaeranthera means "swordlike anthers".

## Care Guide
Tanseyleaf Tansyaster thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, typical of its native semi-arid grasslands. It requires infrequent watering, being highly drought-tolerant, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or low-maintenance gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. Fertilize very sparingly or not at all, as rich soil can reduce flowering.
