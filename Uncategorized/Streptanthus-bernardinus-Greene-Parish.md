## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions, mimicking its native Southern California Mediterranean climate. Provide infrequent watering once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization to ensure its robust health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required, as it is adapted to lean, rocky soils.
