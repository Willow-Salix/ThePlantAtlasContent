## Introduction
Lysimachia ( LY-sim-AY-kee-ə) is a genus consisting of 182 accepted species of flowering plants traditionally classified in the family Primulaceae. Based on a molecular phylogenetic study it was transferred to the family Myrsinaceae, before this family was later merged into the Primulaceae.

## Care Guide
This rare Hawaiian native requires consistent moisture and high humidity, thriving in bright, indirect light, mimicking its wet cliff habitat. Ensure excellent drainage and protect from intense direct sun. It is adapted to nutrient-poor rocky substrates, so avoid over-fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low. Use a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly, or only when signs of nutrient deficiency are present.
