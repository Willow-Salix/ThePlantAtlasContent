## Introduction
A birch is a thin-leaved deciduous hardwood tree of the genus Betula (), in the family Betulaceae, which also includes alders, hazels, and hornbeams. It is closely related to the beech-oak family Fagaceae. The genus Betula contains 30 to 60 known taxa of which 11 are on the IUCN 2011 Red List of Threatened Species. They are typically short-lived pioneer species and are widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in northern areas of temperate climates and in boreal climates. Birch wood is used for a wide range of purposes.

## Care Guide
This rare birch requires a site with full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained, acidic to neutral soil. Ensure regular watering to prevent drought, especially during dry periods, and provide moderate fertilization to support its growth in conditions similar to its native Appalachian mountain habitat.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in moderately fertile, acidic to neutral soils rich in organic matter. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost application in spring is beneficial, especially for young trees.
