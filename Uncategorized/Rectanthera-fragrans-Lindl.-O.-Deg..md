## Introduction
Callisia is a genus of flowering plants in the spiderwort family, Commelinaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as roselings. It is native to the Western Hemisphere from the southern United States to Argentina. The generic name is derived from the Greek word κάλλος (kallos), meaning "beauty."
Some members of Callisia may cause allergic reactions in pets (especially cats and dogs), characterised by red, itchy skin.  Notable culprits are C. fragrans (inch plant) and C. repens (turtle vine).

## Care Guide
This epiphytic orchid thrives in cool, humid conditions with bright, indirect light, mimicking its native montane rainforest habitat. It requires consistent moisture, allowing slight drying between waterings, and benefits greatly from high humidity. Fertilize lightly during periods of active growth to support its development.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced orchid-specific fertilizer during active growth, typically at half strength.
