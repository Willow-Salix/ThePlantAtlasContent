## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (primarily Eastern Canada and Northeastern USA) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland and Moist Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it thrives in open fields, meadows, and along the edges of woodlands, indicating a need for at least 6 hours of direct sun daily, but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, especially during dry spells, to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Its natural habitat of moist meadows suggests it does not tolerate prolonged drought. |

## Introduction
Sisyrinchium is a large genus of annual to perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. Native to the New World, the species are known as blue-eyed grasses. Although they are not true grasses (Poaceae), they are monocots.
Several species in the eastern United States are threatened or endangered. This may be due to niche species emerging from their unique tendency toward rapid speciation which helps them adapt to specialized arenic (sandy) habitats.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil, mimicking its native meadow and open woodland environments. It requires regular watering and benefits from light fertilization in spring to support healthy growth and abundant flowering.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a diluted liquid feed once in spring is usually sufficient. Over-fertilizing can lead to excessive foliage at the expense of flowers.
