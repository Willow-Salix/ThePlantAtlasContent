## Care Guide
This adaptable prairie plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering, tolerating dry spells once established, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization. Its resilient nature makes it a relatively low-maintenance perennial.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a prairie plant, it is adapted to average soil fertility; excessive fertilization can lead to leggy growth at the expense of flowering.
