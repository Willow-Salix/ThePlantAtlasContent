## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions across Africa, Asia (including India, Southeast Asia, China, Japan), and Australia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests and Grasslands |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade, mimicking their natural habitat under a canopy or at forest edges; avoid harsh direct sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist during the active growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings; good drainage is essential to prevent root rot. Reduce watering significantly during any dormant period. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Peristylus orchids flourish in bright, indirect light and consistently moist conditions, typical of their tropical forest and grassland origins. Ensure good drainage and feed lightly during active growth. Reduce watering when the plant enters dormancy to prevent rot.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, diluted orchid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) every 2-4 weeks during the active growing period; cease fertilization during dormancy.
