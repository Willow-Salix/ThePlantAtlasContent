## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions across Africa, Asia (including India, Southeast Asia, China, Japan), and Australia |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests and Grasslands |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade, mimicking their natural habitat under a canopy or at forest edges; avoid harsh direct sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist during the active growing season, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings; good drainage is essential to prevent root rot. Reduce watering significantly during any dormant period. |

## Introduction
Peristylus, sometimes commonly known as ogre orchids or bog orchids is a genus of flowering plants from the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It consists of over 100 known species found across much of eastern and southern Asia as well as in Australia and on many islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

## Care Guide
Peristylus orchids flourish in bright, indirect light and consistently moist conditions, typical of their tropical forest and grassland origins. Ensure good drainage and feed lightly during active growth. Reduce watering when the plant enters dormancy to prevent rot.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, diluted orchid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) every 2-4 weeks during the active growing period; cease fertilization during dormancy.
