## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (British Columbia south through western US, including California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico in mountainous regions) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun (requires ample direct light, especially in cooler climates) |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth (spring/early summer), allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot. Drought-tolerant once established. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lewisia is a plant genus, named for the American explorer Meriwether Lewis (1774-1809) who encountered the species in 1806. The native habitat of Lewisia species is rocky ground and cliffs in western North America. Native Americans ate the roots, which have also been used to treat sore throats.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pygmy Lewisia thrives in full sun with extremely well-draining soil, mimicking its native alpine environment. Water sparingly, focusing on the active growing season, and ensure excellent drainage to prevent rot. Fertilization is generally unnecessary and can harm the plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Native to lean, rocky soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
