## Care Guide
Silverberry is a hardy and adaptable plant that thrives in full sun to partial shade across a wide range of temperate conditions. It prefers consistently moist soil but demonstrates significant drought tolerance once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities, it requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance option.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate, as it is a nitrogen-fixing plant that enriches the soil and rarely requires supplemental fertilization.
