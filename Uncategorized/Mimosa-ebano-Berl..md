## Care Guide
Texas Ebony thrives in harsh, dry conditions, making it an excellent low-maintenance plant. Provide it with abundant direct sunlight and minimal water, allowing the soil to fully dry between waterings. It has very low nutrient demands, seldom needing fertilization once established.

### Fertilizer
Low; established plants generally do not require fertilization. If needed for young plants, use a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring.
