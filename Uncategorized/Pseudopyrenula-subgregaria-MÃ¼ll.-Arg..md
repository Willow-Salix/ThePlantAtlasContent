## Care Guide
This tropical lichen requires high humidity and indirect light, replicating its natural rainforest environment. Provide consistent moisture through frequent misting and ensure good air circulation. Avoid direct sunlight and traditional soil-based fertilizers.

### Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer is typically required. Lichens obtain nutrients from the air, rain, and their substrate; clean air and water are more important than conventional feeding.
