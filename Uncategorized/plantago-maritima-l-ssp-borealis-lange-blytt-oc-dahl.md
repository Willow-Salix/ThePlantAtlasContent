## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic and Subarctic regions, including coastal areas of Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Iceland), Greenland, and North America (e.g., Alaska, Canada). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Coastal Tundra / Subarctic Coastal |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. This plant thrives in open, exposed environments with intense sunlight and no overhead canopy, typical of its native arctic and subarctic coastal habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil. While it tolerates periods of dryness and damp, saline conditions, it is not accustomed to prolonged drought or standing water. Mimic its natural habitat's intermittent moisture from precipitation and coastal mist. |

## 🌱 Overview
Plantago is a genus of about 200 species of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae, commonly called plantains or fleaworts.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Northern Sea Plantain is a resilient subarctic coastal plant that thrives in full sun and cool temperatures. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, tolerates salinity, and has very low fertilizer needs, making it suitable for hardy, low-maintenance planting in appropriate climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Adapted to nutrient-poor, sandy, or rocky coastal and tundra soils, this plant requires minimal to no supplemental fertilization. Excessive nutrients can be detrimental to its robust, hardy nature.
