## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pacific Trillium thrives in cool, moist, shaded woodland conditions with rich, well-draining soil, mimicking its native forest floor. Ensure consistent moisture during its spring growth phase and protect it from harsh direct afternoon sun. Regular soil enrichment with organic matter is crucial for healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers nutrient-rich, humus-laden soil. Amend with organic compost annually. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring.
