## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (from British Columbia south to central California, and east to Idaho and Montana) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically moist woodland understories) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial to full shade, thriving in dappled or filtered sunlight, especially once overhead tree canopies are fully leafed out in late spring. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil during its active growth period in spring. Can tolerate drier conditions during summer dormancy but should not be allowed to dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Trillium (trillium, wakerobin, toadshade, tri flower, birthroot, birthwort, and sometimes "wood lily") is a genus of about fifty flowering plant species in the family Melanthiaceae. Trillium species are native to temperate regions of North America and Asia, with the greatest diversity of species found in the southern Appalachian Mountains in the southeastern United States.

## Care Guide
Pacific Trillium thrives in cool, moist, shaded woodland conditions with rich, well-draining soil, mimicking its native forest floor. Ensure consistent moisture during its spring growth phase and protect it from harsh direct afternoon sun. Regular soil enrichment with organic matter is crucial for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Prefers nutrient-rich, humus-laden soil. Amend with organic compost annually. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring.
