## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gulfhairawn Muhly thrives in full sun to partial shade within a subtropical environment. It requires moderate watering, preferring well-drained soil and tolerating some drought once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to leaner native soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or it may not be necessary in naturally fertile soils.
