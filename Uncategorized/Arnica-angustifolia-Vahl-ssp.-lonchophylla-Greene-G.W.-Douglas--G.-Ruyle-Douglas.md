## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western and Northern North America (including Alaska, Yukon, British Columbia, and mountainous regions of the western US) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun. This plant is accustomed to intense, unfiltered sunlight found in high-altitude environments above or near the treeline. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering, especially during the growing season, to maintain consistently moist but well-drained soil. It's adapted to moisture from snowmelt and rainfall but requires good drainage to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Arnica  is a genus of perennial, herbaceous plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). The genus name Arnica may be derived from the Greek arni, "lamb", in reference to the plants' soft, hairy leaves. Arnica is also known by the names mountain tobacco and, confusingly, leopard's bane and wolfsbane—two names that it shares with the entirely unrelated genus Aconitum.
This circumboreal and montane (subalpine) genus occurs mostly in the temperate regions of western North America, with a few species native to the Arctic regions of northern Eurasia and North America.
Arnica species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Bucculatrix arnicella.
Arnica was previously classified in the tribe Senecioneae because it has a flower or pappus of fine bristles.
Arnica is the basis of a homeopathic remedy promoted for aiding bruise recovery.

## Care Guide
To care for Narrowleaf Arnica, provide full sun exposure and well-drained, lean soil that mimics its native alpine environment. Maintain consistent moisture throughout the growing season, but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Avoid heavy fertilization, as the plant is adapted to nutrient-scarce conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Alpine soils are typically lean and nutrient-poor, so this plant thrives best without rich feeding. An annual light application of compost may suffice if grown in very poor soil.
