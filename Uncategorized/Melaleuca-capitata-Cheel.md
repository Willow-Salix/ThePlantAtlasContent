| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Heathland and Open Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, thriving in exposed positions typical of heathlands. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistent moisture in well-drained soil; tolerates occasional wet conditions and some drought once established. |

## Introduction
Melaleuca () is a genus of nearly 300 species of plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, commonly known as paperbarks, honey-myrtles, bottlebrushes or tea-trees (although the last name is also applied to species of Leptospermum). They range in size from small shrubs that rarely grow to more than 16 m (52 ft) high, to trees up to 35 m (115 ft). Their flowers generally occur in groups, forming a "head" or "spike" resembling a brush used for cleaning bottles, containing up to 80 individual flowers.
Melaleucas are an important food source for nectarivorous insects, birds, and mammals. Many are popular garden plants, either for their attractive flowers or as dense screens and a few have economic value for producing fencing and oils such as "tea tree" oil. Most melaleucas are endemic to Australia, with a few also occurring in Malesia. Seven are endemic to New Caledonia, and one is found only on Australia's Lord Howe Island. 
Melaleucas are found in a wide variety of habitats. Many are adapted for life in swamps and boggy places, while others thrive in the poorest of sandy soils or on the edge of saltpans. Some have a wide distribution and are common, whilst others are rare and endangered. Land clearing, exotic myrtle rust, and especially draining and clearing of swamps threaten many species.

## Care Guide
Melaleuca capitata is a hardy Australian native that thrives in full sun and well-drained but consistently moist, low-nutrient soils. It requires minimal fertilization, preferably with a low-phosphorus product, and is adaptable to both seasonally wet and somewhat dry conditions once established, reflecting its native heathland environment.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; use a low-phosphorus fertilizer specifically formulated for Australian native plants, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.
