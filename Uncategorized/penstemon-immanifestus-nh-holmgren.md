## 🌱 Overview
Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all Penstemon species alongside beardtongues.
Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to ongoing research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arid-adapted plant needs full sun and excellent drainage to thrive. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions, and avoid rich fertilizers as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low nutrient requirements; thrives in lean, poor soils and does not require regular fertilization.
