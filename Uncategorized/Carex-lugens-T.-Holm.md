## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This cold-hardy sedge requires consistently wet to waterlogged soil conditions, mimicking its native spruce muskeg environment. It prefers full to partial sun exposure and needs minimal to no fertilizer, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils common in its native habitat.
