## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hispaniola (Dominican Republic, Haiti), Puerto Rico, and other parts of the Caribbean. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest, Coastal Scrub, and Moist Subtropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to ensure robust growth and flowering, but can tolerate partial shade, especially in areas with intense afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the topsoil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought-tolerant once established, reflecting its adaptation to distinct wet and dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Bourreria is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as strongbark or strongback. The generic name was chosen by Patrick Browne to honour German pharmacist Johann Ambrosius Beurer. The genus is native to the tropical Americas and to eastern Africa and Madagascar. American species are distributed from Mexico to northern South America, and in the Caribbean and Florida in the United States. The center of diversity is in the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico. The eastern African species range from Ethiopia to Mozambique and to Madagascar, the Comoro Islands, and Mauritius.

## Care Guide
This adaptable Caribbean plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate watering, preferring the soil to dry between sessions. It is drought-tolerant once established and benefits from light fertilization during active growth, making it a relatively low-maintenance option for tropical and subtropical gardens.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding during the active growing season with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer. Less frequent fertilization is needed for established plants in rich soil.
