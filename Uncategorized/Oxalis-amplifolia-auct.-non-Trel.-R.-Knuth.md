## Introduction
Oxalis ( (British English) or  (American English)) is a large genus of flowering plants in the wood-sorrel family, Oxalidaceae, comprising over 550 species. The genus occurs throughout most of the world, except for the polar areas; species diversity is particularly rich in tropical Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.
Many of the species are known as wood-sorrels (also as wood sorrels or woodsorrels) as they have an acidic taste reminiscent of the sorrel proper (Rumex acetosa), which is not closely related. Some species are called yellow sorrels or pink sorrels after the colour of their flowers instead. Other species are colloquially known as false shamrocks, and some called sourgrasses. For the genus as a whole, the term oxalises is also used.

## Care Guide
This Oxalis species, often taxonomically complex or a misidentification, typically hails from the subtropical to tropical regions of the Americas. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and benefits from consistent moisture during active growth, with minimal fertilizer. Its natural resilience allows it to adapt to various conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is needed; a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the main growing season.
