## Introduction
Sphaeralcea is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family (Malvaceae). There are about 40-60 species, including annuals, perennials, and shrubs. Most originate in the drier regions of North America, with some known from South America. They are commonly known as globemallows, globe mallows, false mallows or falsemallows. The name of the genus is derived from the Greek words σφαῖρα (sphaira), meaning "sphere," and αλκεα (alkea), meaning "mallow."
The leaves of these plants are spirally arranged, and usually palmate or toothed. Both stems and leaves are downy. Like other Malvaceae, the flowers are saucer- or cup-shaped, with the stamens joined into a column in the center.
Sphaeralcea species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia olivacea, which has been recorded on S. lindheimeri.

## Care Guide
This arid scrubland native thrives in full sun exposure and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established due to its high drought tolerance. Fertilization is generally not needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to nutrient-poor soils. If desired, use a very light application of balanced fertilizer once in spring.
