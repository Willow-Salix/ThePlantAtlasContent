## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arctic-alpine moss thrives in cool, consistently moist environments with partial sun to partial shade. Mimic its native calcareous substrate and ensure high humidity, avoiding both drought and waterlogging. Fertilizer use should be minimal to none.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Mosses are not heavy feeders; if nutrients are deemed necessary, a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly.
