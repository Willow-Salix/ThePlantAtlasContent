## Care Guide
Tephroseris thrives in cool, temperate conditions with ample sunlight or partial shade and consistently moist soil. Provide regular watering and light fertilization during its active growth period to support its robust, meadow-like growth.

### Fertilizer
Tolerates average to moderately rich soils. A light application of a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season is sufficient, especially in poorer soils.
