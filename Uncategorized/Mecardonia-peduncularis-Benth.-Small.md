## Care Guide
Mecardonia thrives in bright light to partial shade and prefers consistently moist soil, reflecting its native humid subtropical to tropical environments. Fertilize moderately during the active growing season to encourage robust growth and abundant flowering. Ensure the soil does not dry out completely between waterings.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeder. A balanced liquid fertilizer applied every 2-4 weeks during the spring and summer growing season will support vigorous growth and flowering.
