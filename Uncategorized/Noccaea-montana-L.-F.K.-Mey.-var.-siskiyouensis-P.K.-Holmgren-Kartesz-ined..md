## Care Guide
Siskiyou Pennycress is an alpine plant endemic to the Siskiyou Mountains, thriving in full sun and very well-draining, lean soil. It prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and has minimal fertilizer requirements. Mimicking its native habitat will ensure optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low, prefers lean to poor, well-draining soils; a light application of balanced slow-release fertilizer once in spring if growth seems weak is sufficient.
