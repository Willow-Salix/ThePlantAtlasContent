## Care Guide
This hybrid pigweed, native to the Sonoran Desert, thrives in full sun and requires very little water, tolerating drought conditions well. It is adapted to less fertile soils, meaning frequent fertilization is generally unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not required unless soil is extremely poor. Can benefit from a balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season in very lean soils.
