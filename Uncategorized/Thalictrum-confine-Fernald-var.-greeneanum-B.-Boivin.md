## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (Canada: Labrador, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec; USA: Maine, New York, Vermont) |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest / Boreal Forest (moist to wet, often calcareous, rocky slopes, fens, swamps, stream banks) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full sun. Prefers partial shade, especially in warmer climates or during the hottest parts of the day, to prevent scorching and maintain soil moisture. Can tolerate full sun if moisture is consistently high and temperatures are cool. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native habitat in fens, swamps, and moist stream banks. Do not allow the soil to dry out, especially during active growth. |

## Introduction
Thalictrum ( ) is a genus of 120-200 species of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae, native mostly to temperate regions. Meadow-rue is a common name for plants in this genus.
Thalictrum is a taxonomically difficult genus with poorly understood species boundaries; it is in need of further taxonomic and field research for clarification.
Despite their common name of "meadow-rue", Thalictrum species are not closely related to the true rue (family Rutaceae), but resemble its members in having compound leaves twice or thrice divided.

## Care Guide
This Meadow-rue thrives in cool, consistently moist conditions reminiscent of its Eastern North American woodland and fen origins. Provide partial shade to full sun in cool climates, ensuring the soil never dries out. Plant in rich, well-draining soil with ample organic matter, and fertilize lightly to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Thrives in soil rich in organic matter. A balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer applied in early spring, or regular top-dressing with compost, will support healthy growth.
