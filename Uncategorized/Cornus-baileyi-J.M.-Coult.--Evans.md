## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Eastern North America, including the Great Lakes region and parts of the Midwestern United States and Canada. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Wetland/Riparian and Moist Temperate Deciduous Forest edges. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native habitat, it thrives in open, moist areas but also tolerates dappled light at the edges of woodlands. |
| **Watering** | High; requires consistently moist to wet soil. Its natural habitat along stream banks and pond edges indicates it does not tolerate dry conditions. |

## Introduction
Cornus is a genus of about 30–60 species of woody plants in the family Cornaceae, commonly known as dogwoods or cornels, which can generally be distinguished by their blossoms, berries, and distinctive bark. Most are deciduous trees or shrubs, but a few species are nearly herbaceous perennial subshrubs, and some species are evergreen. Several species have small heads of inconspicuous flowers surrounded by an involucre of large, typically white petal-like bracts, while others have more open clusters of petal-bearing flowers. The various species of dogwood are native throughout much of temperate and boreal Eurasia and North America, with China, Japan, and the southeastern United States being particularly rich in native species. The genus is also known from South America with members such as Cornus peruviana. 
Species include the common dogwood Cornus sanguinea of Eurasia, the widely cultivated flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) of eastern North America, the Pacific dogwood Cornus nuttallii of western North America, the Kousa dogwood Cornus kousa of eastern Asia, and two low-growing boreal species, the Canadian and Eurasian dwarf cornels (or bunchberries), Cornus canadensis and Cornus suecica respectively.
Depending on botanical interpretation, the dogwoods are variously divided into one to nine genera or subgenera; a broadly inclusive genus Cornus is accepted here.

## Care Guide
Bailey's Dogwood thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native riparian and wetland habitats. It benefits from nutrient-rich soil and can be fertilized annually in spring. Ensuring adequate moisture is the most critical aspect of its care.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from nutrient-rich, well-draining soil, often found in its native moist woodland environments. A balanced fertilizer or compost can be applied in spring.
