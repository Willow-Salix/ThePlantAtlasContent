## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Lord Howe Island (Australia) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Oceanic |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light is ideal; can tolerate lower light conditions but avoid harsh direct sun which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged; allow the top few inches of soil to dry out between waterings, reflecting its native environment's regular rainfall but good drainage. |

## Introduction
Howea forsteriana, the Kentia palm, thatch palm or palm court palm, is a species of flowering plant in the palm family, Arecaceae, endemic to Lord Howe Island in Australia. It is also widely grown on Norfolk Island. It is a relatively slow-growing palm, eventually growing up to 10 m (33 ft) tall by 6 m (20 ft) wide. Its fronds can reach 3 m (10 ft) long. The palm gets its common name from the capital of Lord Howe Island, Kentia, and the genus name, Howea, from the island itself. The species name forsteriana is after Johann Reinhold Forster and Georg Forster, father and son, who accompanied Captain Cook as naturalists on his second voyage to the Pacific in 1772–1775. The seeds require six years to mature.
The species is considered vulnerable by the World Conservation Union. It is cultivated on Lord Howe Island by collecting wild seeds and germinating them for export worldwide as an ornamental garden or houseplant. The trade in the seeds and seedlings is tightly regulated. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
The Kentia Palm thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture with excellent drainage, mirroring its subtropical island habitat. Fertilize sparingly during warmer months to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced, slow-release palm fertilizer 1-2 times during the growing season (spring/summer), or a diluted liquid fertilizer monthly.
