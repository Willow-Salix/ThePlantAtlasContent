| **Climate** | Arid and Semi-Arid Scrubland and Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, exposed to direct sunlight for most of the day, mimicking its natural habitat on exposed rocks. |

## Introduction
Caloplaca is a lichen genus comprising a number of distinct species. Members of the genus are commonly called firedot lichen, jewel lichen. gold lichens, "orange lichens", but they are not always orange, as in the case of C. albovariegata. The distribution of this lichen genus is worldwide, extending from Antarctica to the high Arctic. It includes a portion of northern North America and the Russian High Arctic. There are about thirty species of Caloplaca in the flora of the British Isles.
A new species of Caloplaca, C. obamae, the first species to be named in honor of Barack Obama, was discovered in 2007 on Santa Rosa Island in California and published in March 2009.

## Care Guide
Orange Lichen thrives in full sun exposure, reflecting its natural habitat on exposed rocks in arid environments. It needs infrequent watering, allowing for complete drying between hydration events, and does not require supplemental fertilizer. Its care focuses on mimicking the dry, sunny conditions of its native desert and scrubland home.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; lichens obtain necessary nutrients directly from the air, dust, and precipitation.
