## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains, USA, particularly Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in the intense, unfiltered light typical of treeless alpine environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season, ensuring excellent drainage. It's adapted to consistent moisture from snowmelt but is highly susceptible to root rot in waterlogged conditions. Allow soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Oreoxis, also known as alpine parsley, is a genus of flowering plants in the carrot family. It includes two species native to subalpine regions of Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah in the west-central United States.

Oreoxis bakeri J.M.Coult. & Rose – Colorado, northern New Mexico, and Utah

## Care Guide
To cultivate Rocky Mountain Alpineparsley successfully, mimic its native alpine environment by providing full sun, excellent drainage, and lean soil. Water moderately during its active growth period, allowing for slight drying between waterings, and avoid over-fertilization to prevent weak growth.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean, mineral-rich, well-drained soils. Minimal to no fertilizer is typically needed, as rich soils can lead to leggy growth and reduced hardiness.
