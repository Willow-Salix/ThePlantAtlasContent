## Care Guide
Macranthera thrives in subtropical humid conditions, requiring consistently moist to wet soil and full sun to partial shade. Provide ample humidity and light, balanced fertilization during the growing season, mindful of its hemiparasitic nature which means it also draws nutrients from host plants.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from light, balanced fertilization during the growing season, especially in poor sandy soils. As a hemiparasite, it also derives nutrients from host plants.
