# Clara Hunt's Milkvetch

| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (Central Valley and surrounding foothills) |

| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun, at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive in its open scrubland environment. |
| **💧 Water** | Highly drought-tolerant, adapted to dry summers; water sparingly, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings. Seasonal moisture from cooler, wetter winters supports active growth, so reduce watering significantly during hot, dry periods. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Californian native thrives in full sun and is very drought-tolerant, adapting to lean, well-draining soils. Provide minimal water, especially during summer dormancy, and avoid heavy fertilization to mimic its Mediterranean shrubland origin.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Native to lean soils, it typically requires little to no supplemental fertilizer; if needed, use a balanced, slow-release type very sparingly during its active growth phase.
