## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern Australia (including Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate woodlands, heaths, and sub-alpine areas, characterized by moderate rainfall and often dry periods, with well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade; thrives with ample direct sunlight to promote flowering. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water regularly during its first year, then infrequently during prolonged dry spells, ensuring excellent drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Banksia marginata, commonly known as the silver banksia, is a species of tree or shrub in the family Proteaceae found throughout much of southeastern Australia. It ranges from the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia to north of Armidale, New South Wales, and across Tasmania and the islands of Bass Strait. It grows in various habitats, including Eucalyptus forest, scrub, heathland and moorland. Banksia marginata varies widely in habit, ranging from a 20-centimetre (7.9 in) shrub to a 12-metre (40 ft) tree. The narrow leaves are linear and the yellow inflorescences occur from late summer to early winter. These flower spikes fade to brown and then grey and develop woody follicles bearing the winged seeds. Originally described by Antonio José Cavanilles in 1800, further collections of B. marginata were designated as several separate species by Robert Brown in 1810. However, all were reclassified as a single species by George Bentham in 1870. No distinct subspecies have been recognised by Banksia expert Alex George, who nonetheless concedes that further work is needed.
Many species of bird, in particular honeyeaters, forage at the flower spikes, as do native and European honeybees. The response to bushfire varies. Some populations are serotinous: they are killed by fire and regenerate from large stores of seed, which have been held in cones in the plant canopy and are released after a fire. Others regenerate from underground lignotubers or suckers from lateral roots. Although it has been used for timber, Banksia marginata is most commonly seen as a garden plant, with dwarf forms being commercially propagated and sold.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Silver Banksia flourishes in full sun with well-drained, low-nutrient soil, reflecting its native Australian habitat. Once established, it is drought-tolerant and needs infrequent watering. Crucially, avoid high-phosphorus fertilizers to prevent toxicity, opting for native plant formulations if feeding.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Requires very low-phosphorus fertilizer, or often no fertilizer, due to its sensitivity to high phosphorus levels. Use a specialist Australian native plant fertilizer if necessary.
