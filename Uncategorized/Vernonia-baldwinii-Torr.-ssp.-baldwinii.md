## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Southeastern United States (including states like Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas, Illinois, Mississippi) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland / Prairie |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun to partial sun exposure, mimicking its native open prairie and field environments where it receives ample light. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist soil, especially during establishment and active growth. However, due to its native grassland habitat, it is quite tolerant of moderate drought once mature. Water deeply when the top soil layer feels dry. |

## Introduction
Vernonia is a genus of about 350 species of forbs and shrubs in the family Asteraceae. Some species of this genus are known as ironweeds. Some species are edible and of economic value. They are known for having intense purple flowers. There have been numerous distinct subgenera and subsections named in this genus, and some botanists have divided the genus into several distinct genera. For instance, the Flora of North America recognizes only about twenty species in Vernonia sensu stricto, seventeen of which are in North America north of Mexico, with the others being found in South America.

## Care Guide
Baldwin's Ironweed thrives in full to partial sun and prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil, showing good drought tolerance once established. Minimal fertilization is needed, as it naturally grows in a variety of soil types across temperate grasslands.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in average to poor soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial in very nutrient-deficient soils, but often isn't necessary.
