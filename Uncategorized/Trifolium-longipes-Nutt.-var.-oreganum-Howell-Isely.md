## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically mountainous regions and wet meadows of Oregon and Northern California. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Meadow/Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun is ideal. In its native habitat, it grows in open, exposed areas, suggesting it needs significant light for healthy growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, mimicking its native wet meadow environment. Water regularly to prevent the soil from drying out, especially during warm periods, but ensure good drainage to avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## Care Guide
This clover thrives in conditions mimicking its native wet meadows: full to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. As a nitrogen fixer, it requires minimal fertilization, focusing more on adequate light and consistent hydration for robust growth.

### Fertilizer
As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it generally does not require high nitrogen fertilization. A low-phosphorus, high-potassium fertilizer or a general-purpose, balanced fertilizer applied sparingly in spring can be beneficial, but often, no additional fertilizer is needed in average soils.
