## 🌱 Overview
Calotropis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae, first described as a genus in 1810. It is native to southern Asia and North Africa.
They are commonly known as milkweeds because of the latex they produce.  Calotropis species are considered common weeds in some parts of the world. The flowers are fragrant and are often used in making floral tassels in some mainland Southeast Asian cultures. Fibers of these plants are called madar or mader.  Calotropis species are usually found in abandoned farmland.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Calotropis thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid conditions. It requires very little water and prefers well-drained soil, adapting well to poor nutrient environments without much need for fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and typically does not require regular fertilization. If growth seems stunted, a light, balanced fertilizer application once a year during the growing season may be beneficial.
