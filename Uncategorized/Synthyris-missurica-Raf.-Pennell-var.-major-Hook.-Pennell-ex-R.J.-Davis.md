## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (specifically states like Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, northern California) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Subalpine Forests and Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to dappled sun. Can tolerate full sun in cooler, high-elevation conditions if soil moisture is consistently maintained, but generally prefers protection from intense afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial. The soil should be kept moist but well-drained, never waterlogged. Regular watering is needed, especially during dry periods, to mimic its natural moist woodland and meadow habitats. |

## Introduction
Veronica is the largest genus in the flowering plant family Plantaginaceae, with about 500 species. It was formerly classified in the family Scrophulariaceae. Common names include speedwell, bird's eye, and gypsyweed.
Taxonomy for this genus was changed in the early 21st century, with the genus Hebe and the related Australasian genera Derwentia, Detzneria, Chionohebe, Heliohebe, Leonohebe and Parahebe now included. Monophyly of the genus is supported by nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and cpDNA.
The taxa of the genus are herbaceous annuals or perennials, and also subshrubs, shrubs or small trees when Hebe is included. Most of the species are from the temperate Northern Hemisphere, though with some species from the Southern Hemisphere; Veronica sect. Hebe is mostly from New Zealand.

## Care Guide
Missouri Synthyris thrives in cool, moist, subalpine conditions with dappled sunlight. Provide consistently moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Protect from intense afternoon sun and ensure regular watering to replicate its native forest and meadow habitat.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, humusy soil. Incorporate organic matter like compost into the soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can be beneficial, but heavy feeding is not necessary.
