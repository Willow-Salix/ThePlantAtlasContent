| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States, Caribbean, Central America, South America |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Humid Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect light to partial shade; avoid direct, harsh sunlight. Thrives in dappled light conditions typical of a forest understory or canopy. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity is crucial. Requires consistent moisture from misting or ambient humidity, but not standing water. As an epiphyte, it absorbs water from the air and rainfall, rather than soil. |

## Care Guide
Pyrgillus americanus, an epiphytic lichen, thrives in environments replicating its native tropical and subtropical humid forests. Provide high humidity through regular misting and ensure it receives indirect to partial shade, avoiding any direct sun. No supplemental feeding is generally needed.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilization required. Lichens derive most of their nutrients from the atmosphere and their substrate; typical plant fertilizers can be detrimental.
