## Introduction
Sisyrinchium is a large genus of annual to perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. Native to the New World, the species are known as blue-eyed grasses. Although they are not true grasses (Poaceae), they are monocots.
Several species in the eastern United States are threatened or endangered. This may be due to niche species emerging from their unique tendency toward rapid speciation which helps them adapt to specialized arenic (sandy) habitats.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native wetland habitats. Ensure the soil never dries out, especially during warmer periods. Fertilization needs are minimal, with a light spring feeding usually being adequate.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if the soil is poor.
