## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern Australia (south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Requires bright indirect light when young, tolerating and preferring full sun as it matures to mimic its emergence as a canopy tree in its native rainforest. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained, reflecting its native high rainfall and humidity. Water regularly, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Care Guide
The Black Booyong thrives in conditions mirroring its native subtropical rainforest, requiring consistently moist, well-drained soil and high humidity. Provide bright indirect to full sun exposure, especially as it matures, and enrich the soil with regular fertilization during active growth to support its vigorous development.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate, balanced fertilization during the active growing season (spring and summer) to support robust growth in typically rich rainforest soils.
