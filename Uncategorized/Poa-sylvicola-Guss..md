## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern Europe (e.g., Italy, Balkan Peninsula, Greece) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands, and Scrub |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, typically found in open woodlands, clearings, or along forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growing season (cooler, wetter months), tolerating drier conditions and potential summer dormancy during hot, dry Mediterranean summers. |

## Introduction
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## Care Guide
Poa sylvicola thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean woodland habitat, preferring full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering during its active growing period in cooler seasons and is tolerant of drier spells in summer. Fertilization should be low to moderate to mimic natural soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer, as it is adapted to the nutrient levels of Mediterranean woodland soils which are not typically very rich. A balanced feed during active growth is sufficient.
