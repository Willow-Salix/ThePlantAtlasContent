## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico, Central America (e.g., Costa Rica, Panama), and tropical South America (e.g., Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Brazil) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest (Epiphytic) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light to partial shade, mimicking its position under a tree canopy. Avoid direct, intense sunlight which can scorch leaves. |
| **Watering** | Frequent watering; keep the central cup (tank) filled with fresh, clean water. Misting regularly is beneficial to maintain high humidity. Allow to dry out briefly between water refills to prevent stagnation, but do not let it stay dry for extended periods. |

## Introduction
Catopsis is a genus in the botanical family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Tillandsioideae. The genus name is from the Greek “kata” (hanging down) and “opsis” (appearance). Catopsis is a genus of plants widespread across much of Latin America from Mexico to Brazil, plus Florida and the West Indies. One of the species, Catopsis berteroniana, is thought to be carnivorous.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic bromeliad thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical rainforest environment, requiring bright, indirect light and high humidity. Ensure its central cup is kept filled with fresh water and it receives regular misting to maintain hydration. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted liquid feed during the active growing season.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the growing season (spring/summer) with a highly diluted (1/4 to 1/8 strength) liquid fertilizer applied to the cup and leaves. As an epiphyte, it gets nutrients from organic debris in its natural habitat, not soil.
