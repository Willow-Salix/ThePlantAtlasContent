| **Climate** | Temperate Subalpine and Forest Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial shade, especially in warmer climates, but can tolerate full sun in cool, moist environments where the soil remains consistently damp. |

## Introduction
Aconitum (), also known as aconite, monkshood, wolfsbane, leopard's bane, devil's helmet, or blue rocket, is a genus of over 250 species of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. These herbaceous, frequently toxic perennial plants are chiefly native to the mountainous parts of the Northern Hemisphere in North America, Europe, and Asia, growing in the moisture-retentive but well-draining soils of mountain meadows.
Most Aconitum species are extremely poisonous and must be handled very carefully.  Several Aconitum hybrids, such as the Arendsii form of Aconitum carmichaelii, have won gardening awards—such as the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Some are used by florists.

## Care Guide
Monkshood thrives in cool, moist temperate climates, preferring partial shade and consistently damp, well-drained, humus-rich soil. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, and provide annual fertilization or compost to maintain soil fertility.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, humusy soil. Amend with compost or apply a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer in spring to support its growth.
