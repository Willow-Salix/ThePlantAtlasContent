| **☀️ Light** | Bright indirect light; avoid direct sun exposure. They thrive under filtered light conditions, often found under a canopy or in misty environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture and high humidity. Water frequently, ensuring the potting medium remains consistently moist but not waterlogged, allowing it to approach dryness between waterings but never fully dry out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lepanthes (from Greek "scaled-flower") is a large genus of orchids with about 800–1000 species, distributed in the Antilles and from Mexico through Bolivia (with very few species in Brazil). The genus is abbreviated in horticultural trade as Lths. Almost all the species in the genus are small and live in cloud forests. Babyboot orchid is a common name.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Lepanthes orchids demand high humidity and bright indirect light, replicating their cloud forest origins. Maintain consistent moisture in a well-draining medium and provide regular, dilute fertilization during active growth to ensure optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As epiphytic orchids, they are accustomed to dilute nutrients. Apply a weak, balanced orchid-specific fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 to 1/8 strength) every 1-2 weeks during active growth, reducing or ceasing during dormant periods.
