## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, North America, and Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest (specifically, damp, shaded microhabitats within these biomes, often on rocks or peat). |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low light; prefers deep shade or filtered indirect light. Direct sunlight should be avoided as it can cause desiccation and damage. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture and high humidity. Keep the substrate damp but not waterlogged, allowing the surface to slightly dry out before rewatering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Tetrodontium is a genus of two species of moss (Bryophyta). Its name refers to its four large peristome teeth.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tetrodontium Moss thrives in cool, highly humid environments with very low light, mimicking its native forest floor or shaded rock crevice habitats. It requires consistently moist conditions, good drainage, and should be protected from direct sunlight and high temperatures. Fertilization is generally unnecessary or extremely infrequent and diluted.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses generally obtain sufficient nutrients from their environment; over-fertilization can be detrimental. If used, apply a highly diluted (1/8th strength) balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly, perhaps once or twice a year.
