## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central Valley and surrounding foothills of California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) to thrive, reflecting its native open habitats. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires moderate watering during its active growth in spring, then infrequent watering or none during hot, dry summers when it may naturally die back. |

## Introduction
Calycadenia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, known commonly as the western rosinweeds. They are native to California, especially around the Central Valley. The ranges of two species (C. fremontii + C. truncata) do extend north into Oregon.

## Care Guide
This annual plant prefers full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. Water moderately during its active spring growth, then reduce significantly as it tolerates summer drought. Minimal fertilization is typically sufficient for healthy development.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Thrives in leaner soils; a light, balanced fertilizer might be beneficial during its spring growth but is often not strictly necessary.
