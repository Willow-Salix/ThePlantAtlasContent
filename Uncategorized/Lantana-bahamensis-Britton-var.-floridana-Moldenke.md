## Introduction
Lantana () is a genus of about 150 species of perennial flowering plants in the verbena family, Verbenaceae. They are native to tropical regions of the Americas and Africa but exist as an introduced species in numerous areas, especially in the Australian-Pacific region, South and Northeastern part of India. The genus includes both herbaceous plants and shrubs growing to 0.5–2 m (1.6–6.6 ft) tall. Their common names are shrub verbenas or lantanas. The generic name originated in Late Latin, where it refers to the unrelated Viburnum lantana.
Lantana's aromatic flower clusters (called umbels) are a mix of red, orange, yellow, or blue and white florets. Other colors exist as new varieties are being selected. The flowers typically change color as they mature, resulting in inflorescences that are two- or three-colored.
"Wild lantanas" are plants of the unrelated genus Abronia, usually called "sand-verbenas".

## Care Guide
This Lantana thrives in full sun, mimicking its native subtropical to tropical habitat in South Florida and the Bahamas. It requires regular watering during the growing season, with soil allowed to dry slightly between waterings, and benefits from light spring fertilization. Once established, it is notably drought-tolerant and low-maintenance.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring. Thrives in average to poor soils and does not require heavy feeding.
