## Care Guide
This temperate forest tree thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular watering is crucial, especially when young, and a moderate feeding schedule can support healthy growth. It is relatively low maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Moderate, benefiting from a balanced slow-release fertilizer or compost application in spring, particularly in less fertile soils.
