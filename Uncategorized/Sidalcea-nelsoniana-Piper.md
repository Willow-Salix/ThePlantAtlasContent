## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western Oregon and southwestern Washington, USA (Pacific Northwest) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Moist Meadow and Woodland Edge |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers some afternoon shade in hotter regions to maintain soil moisture. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil; requires regular and ample watering, especially during dry periods, to mimic its native wetland/moist meadow habitat. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Sidalcea is a genus (approx. 25 species) of the botanical family Malvaceae. It contains several species of flowering plants known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom. They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America.
In mid- to late summer the clumps of toothed basal leaves produce erect flowering stems, with 5-petalled mallow-type flowers in terminal racemes, in shades of pink, white and purple.
Sidalcea is generally diploid (2n = 20), but polyploidy (4n, 6n) also occurs.
Annuality appears to have evolved multiple times (4+) within this genus, although an ancestral annual state with annual paraphyly is also possible. Further, evolution rates within annual Sidalcea lineages appear to be faster than those of perennial lineages, at least when examining nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal and external transcribed spacer regions).

## Care Guide
Nelson's Checkerbloom thrives in consistently moist, average to rich soil under full sun to partial shade, especially in the cooler Pacific Northwest climate. Regular watering is crucial to mimic its native moist meadow environment, and a light spring fertilization can support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from average to rich, well-drained soil. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can promote vigorous growth, especially in poor soils.
