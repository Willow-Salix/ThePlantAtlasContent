## Care Guide
This native grass prefers bright, open conditions and well-draining soil. It requires moderate watering but is quite resilient to occasional dry spells, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant. Minimal fertilization is needed to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a light, balanced fertilizer application once or twice during the growing season is generally sufficient, especially in sandy soils.
