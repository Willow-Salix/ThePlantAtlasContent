## Care Guide
This willow thrives in consistently wet conditions and full sun, mimicking its natural habitat along rivers and streams. Ensure abundant water and well-draining yet constantly moist soil, and it generally requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It often thrives in naturally fertile riparian soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may benefit plants in poor soils, but is usually not essential.
