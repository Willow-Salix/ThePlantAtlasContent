## Introduction
Androsace, commonly known as rock jasmine, is a genus of flowering plants in the  family Primulaceae, second only to Primula in the number of species. It is predominantly Arctic–alpine, with many species in the Himalayas (where the genus originated), the mountains of central Asia, the Caucasus, and the southern and central European mountain systems, particularly the Alps and the Pyrenees.
Plants of this genus are sometimes known as rock jasmines or fairy candelabras, and are widely cultivated for their dense cushions covered in white or pink flowers. There are roughly 110 species.
These plants have small entire or toothed leaves which form a basal rosette.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, preferring dry conditions typical of its native prairies and rocky slopes. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly or not at all to mimic its lean native environment.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; it is adapted to lean, poor soils and excessive nutrients can harm it.
