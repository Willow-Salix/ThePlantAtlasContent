## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, North America, parts of Asia), and widely naturalized elsewhere. |
| **Climate** | Temperate |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to indirect light; avoid harsh, direct sun which can cause desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Maintain consistent moisture in the substrate; never allow it to dry out completely, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## Care Guide
This widespread temperate moss thrives in consistently moist conditions with partial shade or indirect light. It requires minimal nutrients, preferring damp, well-draining substrates like soil or rocks, and should be protected from direct sun.

### Fertilizer
Very low; mosses typically do not require supplemental fertilization. High nutrient levels can be detrimental.
