## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah) and northern Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun, accustomed to intense direct sunlight for most of the day, with minimal shade. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. |

## Introduction
Verbesina, many species of which have crownbeard as part of their common names, is a genus of flowering plants, in the family Asteraceae. It is a large genus of about 350 species.
All of the species bear white or yellow flowers similar to small sunflowers. The name Verbesina very likely refers to the similarity of the foliage to that of the (unrelated) Verbena.
Verbesina species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species. These include Schinia bina, which has been recorded from V. encelioides, and Schinia siren which feeds exclusively on that species.
Pollen grains from eight of the nine species of Verbesina found in Brazil have been characterized as oblate-spheroidal, medium-sized, isopolar monads. They are 3-colplorate with a subtriangular amb, a small polar area, a long colpus, a lalongate endoaperture, a caveate exine and an echinate sexine.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full, direct sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid scrubland environment. It requires minimal watering, with the soil allowed to dry completely between sessions, and has very low fertilizer needs. This makes it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or rock gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low fertility needs; thrives in lean, well-draining soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, diluted fertilizer once a year in spring.
