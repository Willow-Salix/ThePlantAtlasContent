## Introduction
Cloves are the aromatic flower buds of a tree in the family Myrtaceae, Syzygium aromaticum (). They are native to the Maluku Islands, or Moluccas, in Indonesia, and are commonly used as a spice, flavoring, or fragrance in consumer products, such as toothpaste, soaps, or cosmetics. Cloves are available throughout the year owing to different harvest seasons across various countries.

## Care Guide
Clove trees flourish in conditions mimicking their tropical rainforest origin, requiring consistently moist soil and bright, indirect to full sun. Regular feeding is essential to support their robust growth and potential spice production.
