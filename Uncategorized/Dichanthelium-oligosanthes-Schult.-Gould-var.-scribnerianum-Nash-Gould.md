## Care Guide
Scribner's Rosette Grass is a hardy, adaptable plant that thrives in full sun to partial sun conditions. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and is generally low-maintenance regarding fertilization once established. Ensure well-drained soil for best results.
