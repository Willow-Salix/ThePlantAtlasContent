## Introduction
Abutilon  is a large genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia. General common names include Indian mallow and velvetleaf; ornamental varieties may be known as room maple, parlor maple, or flowering maple.
The genus name is an 18th-century Neo-Latin word that came from the Arabic ’abū-ṭīlūn (أبو طيلون),  the name given by Avicenna to this or a similar genus.
The type species is Abutilon theophrasti. Several species formerly placed in Abutilon, including the cultivated species and hybrids commonly known as "flowering maples", have recently (2012, 2014) been transferred to the new genus Callianthe.

## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant flourishes in full sun and extremely dry conditions, making it ideal for arid landscapes. It requires infrequent deep watering, tolerates poor, well-draining soils, and has very low nutrient needs. Avoid overwatering and excessive fertilization to prevent root rot and ensure optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required. Can thrive in poor, rocky soils. If desired, a very light application of a slow-release granular fertilizer in spring is sufficient.
