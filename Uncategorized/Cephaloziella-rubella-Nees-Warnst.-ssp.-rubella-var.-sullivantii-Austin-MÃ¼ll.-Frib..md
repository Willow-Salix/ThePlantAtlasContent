## Care Guide
This liverwort thrives in consistently moist, humid conditions with moderate to bright indirect light, mimicking its native habitat on damp banks in temperate woodlands. It has very low nutrient needs and should be protected from drying out or intense direct sun.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Bryophytes require minimal nutrients; apply a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly, or none at all, as they primarily absorb nutrients from water and air.
