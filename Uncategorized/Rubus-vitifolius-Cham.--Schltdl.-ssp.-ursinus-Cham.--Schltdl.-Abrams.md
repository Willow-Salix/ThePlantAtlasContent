## Care Guide
The California Blackberry thrives in its native Western North American temperate woodlands and chaparral, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistent moisture during its active growth. It benefits from fertile, well-drained soil, ideally enriched with organic matter. While adaptable, regular watering and moderate feeding ensure optimal health and fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization. Benefits from fertile, well-drained soil enriched with compost or a balanced organic fertilizer in early spring and again during fruiting.
