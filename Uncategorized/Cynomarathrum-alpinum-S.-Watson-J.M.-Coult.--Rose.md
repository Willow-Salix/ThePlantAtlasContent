# Alpine Hogfennel

*Cynomarathrum alpinum (S. Watson) J.M. Coult. & Rose* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (primarily the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, parts of Nevada, and Oregon) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (requires direct, unfiltered sunlight for most of the day due to its high-altitude native habitat) |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during active growth, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought tolerant once established, especially in summer. |

## Care Guide
This alpine perennial thrives in full sun and exceptionally well-drained, lean soils, mimicking its native high-elevation habitat in western North America. It requires moderate watering during its active growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and generally needs minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils. Avoid rich, heavy fertilization.
