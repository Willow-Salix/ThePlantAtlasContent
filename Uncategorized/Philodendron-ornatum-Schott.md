## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Bright, indirect light. It thrives in the filtered light found under a dense tree canopy, so direct sun will scorch its leaves. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings to mimic frequent rainfall followed by quick drainage. |

## 🌱 Overview
Philodendron is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. As of September 2025, the Plants of the World Online accepted 625 species; other sources accept different numbers. Regardless of number of species, the genus is the second-largest member of the family Araceae, after genus Anthurium. Taxonomically, the genus Philodendron is still poorly known, with many undescribed species. Many are grown as ornamental and indoor plants. The name derives from the Greek words philo- 'love, affection' and dendron 'tree'. The generic name, Philodendron, is often used as the English name.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Philodendron ornatum, replicate its tropical rainforest environment. Provide bright, indirect light, consistent moisture, and high humidity. Fertilize regularly during the growing season to encourage robust foliage.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring to fall) to support lush growth, as native soils are rich in decaying organic matter.
