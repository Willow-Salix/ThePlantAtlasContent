## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mountains of Central and Southern Europe, including the Alps, Carpathians, and Pyrenees; also found in upland areas of Scandinavia and the British Isles. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Montane |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in full sun in cooler climates or at higher altitudes; partial shade can be beneficial in regions with hot summer afternoons. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist soil but requires excellent drainage. Water regularly, especially during dry spells, but ensure it never sits in water to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Alchemilla is a genus of herbaceous perennial plants in the family Rosaceae, with the common name lady's mantle applied generically as well as specifically to Alchemilla mollis when referred to as a garden plant. The plant used as a herbal tea or for medicinal usage such as gynaecological disorders is Alchemilla xanthochlora or in Middle Europe the so-called common lady's mantle Alchemilla vulgaris. There are about 700 species, the majority native to cool temperate and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia, with a few species native to the mountains of Africa and the Americas.
Most species of Alchemilla are clump-forming or mounded perennials with basal leaves arising from woody rhizomes. Some species have leaves with lobes that radiate from a common point and others have divided leaves—both are typically fan-shaped with small teeth at the tips. The long-stalked, gray-green to green leaves are often covered with soft hairs, and show a high degree of water-resistance (see Lotus effect). Green to bright chartreuse flowers are small, have no petals and appear in clusters above the foliage in late spring and summer.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Alpine Lady's Mantle thrives in cool, sunny to partly shaded locations with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native alpine environment. Ensure good light exposure and moderate, consistent watering while providing minimal fertilization. It is a hardy, relatively low-maintenance perennial.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient. Over-fertilization can lead to leggy growth.
