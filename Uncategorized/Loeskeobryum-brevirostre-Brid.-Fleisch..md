# Loeskeobryum Moss

*Loeskeobryum brevirostre (Brid.) Fleisch.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low light to partial shade; typically grows on the forest floor under a canopy, so direct, intense sunlight should be avoided. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent moisture, emulating the damp conditions of a forest floor. Do not allow the substrate to dry out completely. Benefits from high humidity. |

## Care Guide
Loeskeobryum moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and humid environments with low to partial light, mimicking its temperate forest habitat. Ensure the substrate never dries out completely and avoid direct sun exposure. Fertilization is rarely necessary due to its minimal nutrient requirements.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient needs; mosses derive most of their nutrients from their environment. Fertilization is generally not required, or a very diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied very sparingly.
