## Care Guide
Horseradish is a resilient plant best grown in full sun with consistently moist, fertile soil. Regular watering and annual fertilization with organic matter or a balanced feed will ensure strong growth and high-quality root production, making it a straightforward addition to temperate gardens.

### Fertilizer
Prefers rich, fertile, well-draining soil, often found in floodplains in its native range. Benefits from incorporating ample organic matter (like compost) before planting and a balanced all-purpose fertilizer annually to support vigorous root and foliage growth.
