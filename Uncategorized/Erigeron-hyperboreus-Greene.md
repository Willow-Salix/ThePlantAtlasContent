## Care Guide
Tundra Fleabane thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, reflecting its native alpine tundra habitat. It is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor conditions, so avoid heavy fertilization. This hardy plant is best suited for bright, open environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils typical of tundra environments; over-fertilization can be harmful.
