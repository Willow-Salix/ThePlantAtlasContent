## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southern Florida (USA), West Indies, Mexico, Central America, and South America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Moist Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light. As an understory or epiphytic plant, it thrives in dappled shade and should be protected from direct sunlight, which can scorch its fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep the soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. It requires high humidity, so frequent misting, a humidity tray, or placement in a humid environment (like a bathroom) is beneficial. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## 🌱 Overview
Campyloneurum is a genus of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae, subfamily Polypodioideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). They are commonly known as strap ferns.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for the Narrow Strapfern, mimic its native tropical forest environment by providing consistent moisture, high humidity, and filtered, indirect light. Ensure good drainage and fertilize sparingly during the warmer months to support healthy growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient. Use a diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., half-strength of a balanced houseplant fertilizer) once a month during its active growing season (spring and summer). Avoid over-fertilizing, as it can lead to salt buildup and root burn.
