## Care Guide
Monongahela Barbara's Buttons thrives in consistently wet, acidic soils, requiring constant hydration and bog-like conditions. It prefers full to partial sun exposure and performs best with very little or no supplemental fertilizer, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor wetland environments.
