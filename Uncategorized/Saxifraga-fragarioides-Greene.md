## Care Guide
This alpine perennial thrives in cool, bright conditions with exceptional drainage. Ensure the soil remains consistently moist but never waterlogged, mimicking its native rocky habitat. Protect from intense heat and humidity, and provide minimal fertilization to maintain its compact growth.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer requirements. In its native, often nutrient-poor, rocky soils, it thrives without much. If desired, apply a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer once or twice during the early growing season.
