## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (e.g., Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains) and parts of Europe. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Boreal Forest, Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Filtered light to partial shade; avoid harsh, direct midday sun. Thrives in moderate, cool light conditions. |
| **Watering** | High ambient humidity is essential. Requires frequent exposure to moisture (e.g., misting, regular rainfall) followed by periods of drying to prevent fungal growth. |

## Introduction
Melanelia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Parmeliaceae. These lichens typically grow on rocks and form relatively large, leaf-like structures with brown to blackish upper surfaces and pale undersides. The genus originally included many more species, but most have since been moved to related genera like Melanohalea and Melanelixia, leaving only five accepted species today.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, moist, and clean air environments characteristic of temperate boreal and montane forests. Provide high humidity and filtered light, ensuring it avoids direct, harsh sun. Do not use soil or traditional fertilizers, as it absorbs nutrients from the air and precipitation.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from airborne particles, dust, and precipitation. Highly sensitive to air pollution.
