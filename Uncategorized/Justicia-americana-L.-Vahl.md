## Care Guide
As a native of North American freshwater wetlands, American water-willow requires consistently wet soil and can even thrive with its roots submerged in shallow water. It prefers full sun to partial shade and benefits from moderate to high fertility to support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high fertility. Benefits from a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the active growing season, especially in leaner soils, given its vigorous growth in nutrient-rich wetland environments.
