## Care Guide
Purple Poppymallow is a resilient plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, characteristic of its native prairie habitats. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering and fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for sunny, dry locations.

### Fertilizer
Low; generally not required in average to rich garden soil. If grown in very poor soil, a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring can be applied, but over-fertilization should be avoided.
