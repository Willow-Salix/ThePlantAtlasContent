## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Appalachian Mountains, from Virginia to northern Georgia and Alabama) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to dappled sun; protection from intense afternoon sun, especially in warmer zones, is crucial as it grows as an understory plant or on forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil is essential, mirroring the regular rainfall and high humidity of its native montane forests. Ensure well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Rhododendron (; pl.: rhododendra), from Ancient Greek ῥόδον (rhódon), meaning "rose", and δένδρον (déndron), meaning "tree", is a very large genus of about 1,024 species of woody plants in the heath family (Ericaceae). They can be either evergreen or deciduous. Most species are native to eastern Asia and the Himalayan region, but smaller numbers occur elsewhere in Asia, and in North America, Europe and Australia.
It is the national flower of Nepal, the state flower of Washington and West Virginia in the United States, the state flower of Nagaland and Himachal Pradesh in India, the provincial flower of Jeju Province in South Korea, the provincial flower of Jiangxi in China and the state tree of Sikkim and Uttarakhand in India. Most species have brightly coloured flowers which bloom from late winter through to early summer.
Azaleas make up two subgenera of Rhododendron. They are distinguished from "true" rhododendrons by having only five anthers per flower.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Catawba Rosebay requires conditions that mimic its native Appalachian Montane Forest habitat, including partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining, acidic soil. Provide ample moisture and utilize an acid-specific fertilizer to support its robust growth and abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with an acid-specific fertilizer is best, reflecting its native acidic, humus-rich forest soils. Apply sparingly, preferably in early spring.
