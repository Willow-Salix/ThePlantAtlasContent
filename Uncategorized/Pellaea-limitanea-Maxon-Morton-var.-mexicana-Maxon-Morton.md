# Mexican Cliff Brake

*Pellaea limitanea (Maxon) Morton var. mexicana (Maxon) Morton* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico (primarily central and southern mountainous regions) |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Montane Dry Forest/Scrubland (characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons, often on rocky substrates) |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to bright indirect light; avoid harsh, direct midday sun. As a lithophyte, it can tolerate more light than many typical forest ferns. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the active growing season, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce watering significantly during cooler, dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Pellaea may refer to one of two different genera:

Pellaea (bug), a genus of stink bugs.
Pellaea (plant), a genus of ferns.

## Care Guide
This fern thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mexican dry montane habitats, preferring bright indirect light and moderate watering with excellent drainage. Allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings and feed sparingly during its active growth phase to encourage healthy development, while reducing water in cooler periods.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (half strength) once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer). Avoid over-fertilizing.
