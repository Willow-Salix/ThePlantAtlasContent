| **Native Origin** | Central and Southern United States, including states like Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Missouri, Louisiana, and Mississippi. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Prairie and Dry Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun is preferred, thriving in open, exposed locations. It can tolerate very light partial shade, especially in the hottest parts of its range. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water moderately when young, then infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It thrives in conditions with seasonal rainfall patterns but dislikes consistently wet feet. |

## Introduction
Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

## Care Guide
The Western Rough Goldenrod thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established, preferring well-drained soil. It requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for sunny, drier garden spots.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant is adapted to average or poor soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. An annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all in fertile soils, is sufficient.
