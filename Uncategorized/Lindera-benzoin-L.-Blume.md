## Care Guide
The Northern Spicebush thrives in a humid temperate environment, preferring consistently moist, rich, and well-drained soil in partial shade. It requires regular watering to mimic its native wetland-adjacent habitats and benefits from organic matter to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in rich, well-drained soil with high organic content. Benefits from compost or a slow-release, balanced fertilizer annually.
