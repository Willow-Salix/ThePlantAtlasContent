## Introduction
Populus trichocarpa, the  black cottonwood, western balsam-poplar or California poplar, is a  deciduous broadleaf tree species native to western North America. It is used for timber, and is notable as a model organism in plant biology. The tree is notable for the seed-carrying cottony fluff it releases into the air each spring.

## Care Guide
The Black Cottonwood thrives in full sun and demands consistently moist to wet soil, mirroring its native riparian forest habitat. Ensure it receives abundant water and consider supplementing with fertilizer to support its rapid growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Benefits from rich, well-draining, and fertile soil, often found in riparian zones, and can benefit from balanced fertilizer during the growing season to support rapid growth.
