## Introduction
Oxytropis is a genus of plants in the legume family. It includes over 600 species native to subarctic to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. It is one of three genera of plants known as locoweeds, and are notorious for being toxic to grazing animals. The other locoweed genus is the closely related Astragalus. Most oxtropis species are native to Eurasia and North America, but several species are native to the Arctic. These are hairy perennial plants which produce raceme inflorescences of pink, purple, white, or yellow flowers which are generally pea-like but have distinctive sharply beaked keels. The stems are leafless, the leaves being all basal. The plant produces legume pods containing the seeds.

## Care Guide
This hardy plant requires full sun and thrives in lean, well-drained soils typical of its native alpine and subalpine environments. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean, well-drained, infertile soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
