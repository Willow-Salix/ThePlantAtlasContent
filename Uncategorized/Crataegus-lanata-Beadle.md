| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Woodland/Forest Edges (Humid Subtropical Climate) |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun to partial shade, with best flowering and fruit production occurring in full sun exposure. |
| **Watering** | Requires regular watering during its establishment period. Once mature, it is moderately drought-tolerant but benefits from occasional deep watering during extended dry spells, particularly in well-drained soils. |

## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
The Hoary Hawthorn, native to the humid subtropical woodlands of the southeastern U.S., prefers full sun for optimal growth. It is quite adaptable and becomes moderately drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal fertilizer in average, well-drained soils.

### Fertilizer
Generally low fertilizer needs. It can tolerate average to poor soils. A light application of a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial for young or struggling plants, but is often not necessary for established, healthy trees.
