## Care Guide
This alpine plant requires full sun and cool temperatures, mimicking its native subalpine environment. Ensure excellent drainage and allow soil to dry slightly between waterings, as it's adapted to lean, well-drained soils with low nutrient availability.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of alpine environments and does not require heavy fertilization.
