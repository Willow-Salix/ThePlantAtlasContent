## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Eastern North America, specifically the Midwestern and Southeastern United States (e.g., Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade, particularly in summer when the deciduous tree canopy is full. It can tolerate more early spring sun before trees leaf out. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is crucial during its active growing period in spring, but it requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Reduce watering significantly as it goes dormant in late summer and fall. |

## 🌱 Overview

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This woodland native prefers a temperate climate with consistent moisture and partial to full shade, especially during the summer. Plant in rich, well-drained organic soil, and allow it to go dormant by reducing water in late summer as leaves naturally die back.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in rich, organic woodland soil. Amend with compost or leaf mold annually in early spring. A light application of a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer can be beneficial but is often not strictly necessary in good soil.
