## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Afghanistan, Cyprus, East Aegean Is., Iran, Iraq, Kriti (Crete), Lebanon-Syria, Pakistan, Palestine, South European Russia, Transcaucasus, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean / Semi-arid Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. As an annual from open, scrubland environments, it thrives with abundant direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growth period (cooler months), allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is accustomed to winter rainfall and summer drought, so reduce watering significantly as temperatures rise or as the plant completes its lifecycle. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Provide full sun and well-draining soil. Water moderately during its cooler growing season, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and reduce significantly as it approaches dormancy or senescence in hot, dry conditions. Fertilize sparingly only during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization, if any, primarily during its active growth phase. It is adapted to moderately fertile to poor soils typical of its native habitat.
