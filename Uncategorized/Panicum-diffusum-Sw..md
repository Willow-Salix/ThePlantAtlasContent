## Care Guide
West Indian Panicgrass flourishes in tropical wet and dry conditions, requiring full sun and moderate watering to mimic its native habitat. It benefits from light to moderate fertilization during active growth, making it a relatively low-maintenance grass for suitable climates.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. While not a heavy feeder, a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can promote vigorous growth during the active growing season, typical for grasses in tropical soils.
