## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar distribution across the Northern Hemisphere, including Arctic, subarctic, and high-alpine regions of Europe (e.g., Scandinavia, Scotland), North America (e.g., Greenland, Canada). |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra and Alpine Tundra, characterized by cold temperatures, exposed conditions, and often growing on siliceous rocks. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in exposed conditions with high light intensity when available, but tolerates periods of lower light and cloud cover typical of its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent; relies on atmospheric moisture, rain, and snowmelt. Highly drought-tolerant, requiring occasional moisture from misting or natural rainfall and good air circulation to dry out between periods. |

## Introduction
Lecidea is a genus of crustose lichens with a carbon-black ring or outer margin (exciple) around the fruiting body disc (apothecium), usually (or always) found growing on (saxicolous) or in (endolithic) rock. Lichens that have such a black exciple are called lecideine, meaning "like Lecidea, even if they are not in this genus. Members of the genus are commonly called disk lichens or tile lichens.

## Care Guide
Lecidea tessellata is a hardy lichen adapted to cold, exposed, and rocky environments. Provide high light exposure, excellent air circulation, and infrequent watering via misting or natural rainfall, allowing it to dry out. No traditional fertilization is needed as it obtains nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens derive essential nutrients from the air, rainfall, and their substrate surface. No external fertilizer is required or beneficial.
