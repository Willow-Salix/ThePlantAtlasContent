## 🧤 Care Instructions
Elkweed thrives in full to partial sun and requires well-draining soil, mimicking its native montane and meadow habitats. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization as it prefers leaner conditions. Good drainage is essential to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. These plants are often found in naturally lean to moderately fertile soils. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring, if desired, is sufficient, but often not necessary.
