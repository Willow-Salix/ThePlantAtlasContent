## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (California, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun exposure, mimicking its open, dry native habitats. |
| **Watering** | Needs very infrequent watering, allowing soil to dry out completely between sessions due to its adaptation to arid and semi-arid conditions. |

## Introduction
Cordylanthus (lit. 'club-flower'), commonly known as bird's beaks, is a genus of parasitic plants in the broomrape family, Orobanchaceae. These western North American natives are sparse, weedy-looking annuals with long branching erect stems and little foliage, and many bear bird's-beak–shaped flowers. They are remarkable among the broomrapes for growing at searing temperatures in arid climates.

## Care Guide
Cultivate King's Bird's-beak in full sun with minimal watering to replicate its native arid scrubland environment. Provide low to no supplemental fertilizer, especially considering its hemiparasitic nature and adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; its native soils are typically poor, and as a hemiparasite, it derives some nutrients from host plants.
