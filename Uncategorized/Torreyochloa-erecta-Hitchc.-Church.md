## Care Guide
Spiked False Mannagrass is a cool-season wetland grass best suited for consistently wet to waterlogged conditions in full sun to partial shade. Originating from cool temperate regions of North America, it requires ample moisture and tolerates moderate soil fertility, making it ideal for bog gardens or pond edges.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; thrives in soils with average to good organic matter content. A light application of a balanced fertilizer can be beneficial in poor soils.
