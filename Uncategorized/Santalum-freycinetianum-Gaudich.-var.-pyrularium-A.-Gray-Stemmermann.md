## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands |
| **Climate** | Tropical/Subtropical Mesic Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Can tolerate some morning sun, but protect from harsh midday direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out slightly between waterings, mimicking tropical rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Santalum is a genus of woody flowering plants in the Santalaceae family, the best known and most commercially valuable of which is the Indian sandalwood tree, S. album. Members of the genus are trees or shrubs. Most are root parasites which photosynthesize their own food, but tap the roots of other species for water and inorganic nutrients. Several species, most notably S. album, produce highly aromatic wood, used for scents and perfumes and for herbal medicine. It has about 25 known species which are native to Island Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Timor-Leste, and the Philippines), Melanesia (Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Fiji, and New Caledonia), Australia, Polynesia, the Bonin Islands of Japan, and the Juan Fernández Islands of Chile.
Indian sandalwood (S. album) is native to the tropical dry deciduous forests the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Arnhem Land of northern Australia. It is the only species of the genus found on the Asian mainland, having been introduced to India from the Lesser Sundas centuries ago. Indian sandalwood has been stripped from most of India's forests, and is now rare in the wild. Five species, including S. album, are native to Australia. S. acuminatum, known as the sweet quandong or native peach, produces a shiny bright red fruit used increasingly in Australia for jams, jellies, chutneys, and pies. Four species, (including Santalum paniculatum, commonly called ʻiliahi), are endemic to Hawaiʻi. S. fernandezianum, endemic to the Juan Fernández Islands off the coast of Chile, was also overexploited for its aromatic wood, and may now be extinct.
Santalum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Endoclita malabaricus.

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native thrives in tropical mesic forest conditions, requiring bright, indirect to partial sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil. It benefits from moderate fertilization, mindful of its hemi-parasitic tendencies which allow it to draw nutrients from host plants.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season. Due to its hemi-parasitic nature, it obtains some nutrients from host plants, so over-fertilization should be avoided.
