## Care Guide
Irish Ivy thrives in partial to full shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native temperate oceanic forest environment. Provide moderate humidity and fertilize sparingly during the growing season to support its vigorous growth.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from light feeding during the growing season (spring/summer), mirroring the organic-rich forest soils. Use a balanced liquid fertilizer monthly or a slow-release granular product once a year.
