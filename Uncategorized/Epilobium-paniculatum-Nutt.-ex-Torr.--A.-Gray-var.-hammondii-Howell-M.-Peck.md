## Introduction
Epilobium brachycarpum is a species of willowherb known by the common names tall willowherb, tall annual willowherb, panicled willowherb and tall fireweed. It is native to North America, including Canada from Quebec to British Columbia, the western United States and the Dakotas, and southwestern and Central Mexico. It is a resident of varied open and woodland habitats. It has also been introduced to some areas in South America. This is a tall glandular, hairy annual herb occasionally reaching 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) in height. It is somewhat gangly and thin like an erect weed, with narrow, curving, pointed leaves up to a few centimetres in length. The flower has four petals which may be so deeply notched that they look like four pairs. They are generally light purple or pink, with darker veining. The fruit is a capsule 1 to 3 centimetres (0.39 to 1.18 in) long.

## Care Guide
Provide full sun to partial shade and moderate watering, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings. This plant thrives in average, well-drained soil and does not require extensive fertilization. Mimic its native open, seasonally moist conditions for best growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It grows in a variety of soils, including disturbed sites, suggesting it doesn't require rich soil or heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial.
