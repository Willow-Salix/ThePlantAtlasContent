## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Yukon (Canada), Alaska (USA) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (requires direct, unfiltered sunlight during the short growing season characteristic of arctic-alpine environments) |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing soil to dry between waterings; requires excellent drainage typical of its native gravelly and sandy habitats. Tolerates periods of drought once established. |

## Introduction
Oxytropis is a genus of plants in the legume family. It includes over 600 species native to subarctic to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. It is one of three genera of plants known as locoweeds, and are notorious for being toxic to grazing animals. The other locoweed genus is the closely related Astragalus. Most oxtropis species are native to Eurasia and North America, but several species are native to the Arctic. These are hairy perennial plants which produce raceme inflorescences of pink, purple, white, or yellow flowers which are generally pea-like but have distinctive sharply beaked keels. The stems are leafless, the leaves being all basal. The plant produces legume pods containing the seeds.

## Care Guide
Thriving in full sun and very well-drained, lean soils, the Warty Oxytrope requires moderate watering, allowing the ground to dry out between applications. It needs no significant fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor, arctic-alpine environments and its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; native soils are typically nutrient-poor. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen.
