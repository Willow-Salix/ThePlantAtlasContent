*Railliardia scabra DC. var. munroi Sherff* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (specifically Maui, Molokaʻi, and Lānaʻi) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Mesic to Dry Shrubland/Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in bright, direct light, similar to its exposed native habitats on ridges and lava flows. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is adapted to periods of drought, reflecting its native mesic to dry climate, but benefits from regular water during active growth. |

## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native thrives in bright light and well-draining soil, typical of its natural mesic to dry shrubland and forest habitats. Water moderately, allowing soil to dry between sessions, and fertilize lightly to mimic its nutrient-poor native environment. Ensure good air circulation.

### Fertilizer
Low. Plants in its native habitat often grow in nutrient-poor, well-draining soils (e.g., lava flows). Use a diluted, balanced slow-release fertilizer sparingly during the growing season. Avoid over-fertilization.
