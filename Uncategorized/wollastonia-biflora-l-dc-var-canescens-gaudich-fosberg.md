# Beach Sunflower
### *Wollastonia biflora (L.) DC. var. canescens (Gaudich.) Fosberg*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in tropical and subtropical coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific, including numerous Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and parts of Australia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Coastal |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun. This plant thrives in direct, intense sunlight, typical of open coastal environments like beaches and rocky shores. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering. While it appreciates consistent moisture in well-draining soil, its adaptation to sandy coastal habitats means it is highly drought-tolerant once established, tolerating periods of dryness between rains. |

## 🌱 Overview
Wollastonia is the scientific name of several genera of organisms and may refer to:

Wollastonia (beetle) Heer in Heer & Escher, 1852, a prehistoric genus of beetles in the family Hydrophilidae

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This resilient coastal plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its tropical coastal origins. It requires moderate watering but is very drought-tolerant once established, and has low fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance choice for suitable climates.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Native to often nutrient-poor sandy soils, it does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year is generally sufficient.
