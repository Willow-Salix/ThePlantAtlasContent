## 🌱 Overview
Oreomecon nudicaulis, synonym Papaver nudicaule, the Iceland poppy, is a boreal flowering plant. It is native to subpolar regions of Asia and the Yukon in North America (but not Iceland), and has been introduced elsewhere (south Argentina, Colorado, Greenland, and Tibet). Iceland poppies are hardy but short-lived perennials, often grown as biennials. They yield large, papery, bowl-shaped, lightly fragrant flowers supported by hairy, 1 foot (30 cm) curved stems among feathery blue-green foliage 1–6 inches long. They were first described by botanists in 1759. The wild species blooms in white or yellow, and is hardy from USDA Zones 3a-10b.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Iceland Poppy thrives in full sun and cool temperatures, mimicking its native subarctic and alpine environments. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and benefits from light fertilization to support its prolific blooms during its relatively short growing season.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a light application of balanced granular fertilizer or compost in spring.
