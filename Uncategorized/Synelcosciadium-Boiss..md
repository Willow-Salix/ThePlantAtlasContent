# Synelcosciadium

*Synelcosciadium Boiss.* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Israel (Mount Carmel) and the Near East |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; it thrives with ample direct sunlight, mimicking its native open, sunny habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growth phase in cooler months, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Significantly reduce or cease watering during hot, dry summer dormancy. |

## Care Guide
This plant requires a Mediterranean-like environment, preferring full sun and well-draining soil. Water moderately during its cooler growing period and keep mostly dry through hot summers, applying minimal fertilizer during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the active growing season (winter/spring) with a diluted, balanced fertilizer. Avoid excessive fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poorer, rocky soils.
