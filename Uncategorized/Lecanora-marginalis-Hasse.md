## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
Lecanora marginalis Hasse, a saxicolous lichen, demands high sun exposure and infrequent moisture, adapted to arid to semi-arid climates. It requires no traditional fertilizer, absorbing all necessary nutrients from the air and rain, making it a low-maintenance organism in its native conditions.

### Fertilizer
None, obtains essential nutrients directly from the atmosphere and precipitation
