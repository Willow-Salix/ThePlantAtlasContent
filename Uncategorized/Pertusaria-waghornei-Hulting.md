## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | North America (eastern US, Canada), Europe, parts of Asia |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Forest, Boreal Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to moderate, indirect light. Protect from direct, intense sunlight, as it naturally grows under a forest canopy. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent high humidity and moisture. Regular misting or placement in a humid environment is essential. Avoid complete drying out, but also ensure good air circulation to prevent mold. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pertusaria is a large genus of warty crustose lichens in the Pertusariaceae family. The fruiting bodies are usually modified apothecia that immersed in warts on the main body (thallus) with small holes for the spores to emerge, similar to ostioles, or are fully above and lecanorine (spore bearing discs surrounded by a ring of tissue similar to the tissue of the thallus.  Members of the genus are commonly called wart lichens.
The widespread genus contains over 500 species.
Classification in the large genus relies heavily on thallus chemistry to distinguish and classify species, some of which differ only in the presence or absence of a single secondary chemical. Lichexanthone, norlichexanthone, and their chlorinated derivatives are common in this genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Waghorne's pore lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native temperate and boreal forest habitats. It requires consistent moisture and high ambient humidity, achieved through regular misting or a humid setting. Avoid direct sun and rich fertilization, as it is sensitive to excess nutrients.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very minimal to no fertilizer. Lichens are sensitive to excess nutrients; they typically absorb what they need from air and rainwater.
