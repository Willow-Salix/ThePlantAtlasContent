## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Walter's Sedge thrives in consistently wet to saturated conditions, ideally with full sun to partial shade. Mimicking its native wetland environment, it requires constant moisture and generally minimal fertilization. Over-fertilization should be avoided to prevent harm.

### Fertilizer
Minimal; can tolerate nutrient-poor soils but benefits from very light, balanced fertilization during the growing season if desired.
