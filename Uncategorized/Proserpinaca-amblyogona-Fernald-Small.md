## Introduction
Proserpinaca, commonly called mermaidweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the watermilfoil family (Haloragaceae). It is a small genus, comprising only two to three extant species, all of which are native to eastern North America and the West Indies. All species in this genus are found in aquatic or terrestrial wetland habitats.
Proserpinaca can be distinguished from its relative Myriophyllum by having 3 stamens and carpels per flower (as opposed to having 4 or 8).

## Care Guide
Pond Mermaid-weed thrives in constantly wet or submerged conditions, mimicking its native wetland habitat in the southeastern US. It prefers full sun to partial shade and benefits from moderate fertilization in its aquatic environment.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization; benefits from nutrients in the water column or a nutrient-rich aquatic substrate, especially during active growth.
