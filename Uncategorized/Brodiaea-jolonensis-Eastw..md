## Introduction
Brodiaea , also known by the common name cluster-lilies, is a monocot genus of flowering plants.
One school of thought places the genus in the family Themidaceae, while another school of thought places it in the subfamily Brodiaeoideae of the family Asparagaceae.  The USDA Plants Database still classifies the genus Brodiaea in the family Liliaceae.
Brodiaea species occur along the Pacific Coast region of North America, from British Columbia throughout California into the Baja California Peninsula. They are especially common in northern California.

## Care Guide
This Californian native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its chaparral habitat. Provide regular watering during its active growth in cooler months, followed by a dry, dormant period in summer. Avoid over-fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in lean, well-draining soils; excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
