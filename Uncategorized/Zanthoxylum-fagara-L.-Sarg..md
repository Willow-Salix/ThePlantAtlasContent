## Care Guide
Thriving in subtropical to tropical dry environments, Lime Pricklyash requires full sun and well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular watering allowing soil to dry slightly. Provide moderate fertilization during its active growing season.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeder. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once or twice during the growing season (spring/summer). Less frequent fertilization is needed in established plants or fertile soils.
