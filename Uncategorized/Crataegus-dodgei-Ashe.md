## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
Dodge's Hawthorn thrives in temperate climates with full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate, consistent watering, especially when young, and benefits from light fertilization in spring. Once established, it is relatively low-maintenance and tolerant of varying conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring or an annual application of compost, particularly in poor soils.
