## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Jamaica |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun, especially if grown in cooler climates, and can tolerate exposed conditions. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Reduce watering significantly during dormant or dry periods, mimicking its native dry season adaptation. |

## Introduction
Garrya is a genus of flowering plants in the family Garryaceae native to Mexico, the western United States, Central America and the Greater Antilles. Common names include silk tassel and tassel bush.
They are evergreen dioecious wind-pollinated shrubs growing to 1–5 m (3–16 ft) tall. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, and are simple, leathery, dark green to gray-green, ovate, 3–15 cm (1–6 in) long, with an entire margin and a short petiole. The flowers are gray-green catkins, short and spreading when first produced in late summer; the male catkins becoming long (3–20 cm (1–8 in)) and pendulous in late winter when shedding pollen; the female catkins usually a little shorter and less pendulous. The fruit is a round dry berry containing two seeds.

## Care Guide
Fadyen's Silktassel thrives in conditions mimicking its native Jamaican dry limestone woodlands, preferring full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. Water moderately during its growing season, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and reduce watering during drier periods. Light fertilization, if any, is sufficient for this robust plant.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization, if any. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor limestone soils, so a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring is sufficient, or none at all if soil conditions are reasonable.
