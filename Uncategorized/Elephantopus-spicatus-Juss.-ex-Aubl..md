## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions. Fertilize moderately during its active growth period with a balanced fertilizer. It is generally low-maintenance and adaptable to various well-draining soil types.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding; apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season, or use a slow-release granular fertilizer once per season.
