## Care Guide
The Arizona boxelder is a riparian tree from arid regions, thriving in full sun with consistent moisture, particularly in well-drained soils. While adaptable, regular watering is crucial, especially during dry spells and for young plants. Fertilizer needs are typically low.

### Fertilizer
