## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread in temperate and boreal regions of Europe and North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest/Woodland, typically found in humid, shaded microclimates within these regions. |
| **Sunlight** | Requires low to moderate, indirect light. It thrives in shaded conditions, such as on the bark of trees or mossy rocks in the forest understory, and should be protected from direct, intense sunlight. |
| **Watering** | As a lichen, it primarily absorbs moisture from the atmosphere. It needs high atmospheric humidity and frequent exposure to moisture (e.g., rain, dew), with intermittent drying periods. Consistent dampness without drying can be detrimental. |

## Introduction

## Care Guide
Bacidina arnoldiana is a lichen that thrives in cool, humid, and shaded conditions found in temperate forests. Its care involves providing high atmospheric humidity, low to moderate indirect light, and strictly avoiding any form of chemical fertilization or pollution. Mimicking its natural environment with periods of moisture followed by drying is key.

### Fertilizer
Lichens do not require traditional fertilizers. They obtain essential nutrients from the air and the substrate they grow on. They are highly sensitive to pollutants and chemical inputs, so no fertilization is needed or recommended.
