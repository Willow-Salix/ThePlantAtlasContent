## Care Guide
This desert vine thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between sessions. Mimic its arid native habitat by providing excellent drainage and minimal fertilizer for optimal growth and drought tolerance.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, diluted fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season, or not at all in nutrient-poor desert soils.
