## 🧤 Care Instructions
To thrive, the Miracle Berry requires a consistently warm, humid environment with bright, indirect light, similar to its native West African rainforest understory. Maintain continuously moist, well-draining, slightly acidic soil and protect it from direct, intense sunlight and cold temperatures. Provide a balanced fertilizer during active growth to support its fruiting.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, acid-forming fertilizer, especially during growing season. Rainforest soils are often rich in organic matter but can be nutrient-leached.
