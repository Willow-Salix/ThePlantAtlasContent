## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Cusick's lupine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its native semi-arid scrubland habitat in the Western U.S. It requires minimal watering once established due to its drought tolerance, and generally does not need fertilizer as it fixes its own nitrogen.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed; avoid high nitrogen as it is a nitrogen fixer.
