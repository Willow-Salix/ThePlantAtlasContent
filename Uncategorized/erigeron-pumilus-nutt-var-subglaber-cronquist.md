## 🧤 Care Instructions
Low Fleabane requires conditions similar to its native dry, open habitats in western North America. Provide full sun and well-draining soil, allowing it to dry out between infrequent waterings due to its drought tolerance. Fertilization is rarely needed as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant thrives in lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils and typically does not require regular fertilization.
