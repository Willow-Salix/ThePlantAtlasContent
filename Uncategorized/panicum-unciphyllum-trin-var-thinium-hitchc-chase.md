## 🧤 Care Instructions
This grass thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native tropical savanna environment in Brazil. It requires moderate watering, mimicking its native wet and dry seasons by allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Light to moderate fertilization during active growth will support healthy development.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, all-purpose granular or liquid fertilizer. Over-fertilization is generally not necessary.
