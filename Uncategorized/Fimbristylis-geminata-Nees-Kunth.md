## Introduction
Fimbristylis is a genus of sedges. A plant in this genus may be known commonly as a fimbry or   fimbristyle. There are over 300 species distributed worldwide. Several continents have native species but many species have been introduced to regions where they are not native. Some are considered weeds. These are typical sedges in appearance, with stiff, ridged stems and cone-shaped terminal panicles of spikelets. They are found in wet environments, and are most diverse in tropical and subtropical regions.

## Care Guide
This tropical sedge thrives in bright light and consistently wet conditions, mimicking its native wetland habitats. Ensure the soil remains constantly moist or even shallowly inundated. Fertilization needs are low, with infrequent light feeding during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. In natural settings, it thrives on available nutrients in wet soils; for cultivation, a balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength sparingly during the growing season.
