## Introduction
Gentiana () is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the gentian family (Gentianaceae), the tribe Gentianeae, and the monophyletic subtribe Gentianinae. With over 300 species, it is considered a large genus. Gentians are notable for their mostly large trumpet-shaped flowers, which are often of an intense blue hue, though some are also bright yellow. The type species of the genus is Gentiana lutea.
The genus name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king who may have discovered tonic properties in gentians.

## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine plant requires full sun and consistently moist, yet exceptionally well-drained, lean soil. It is crucial to prevent waterlogging, especially outside of the brief summer growing period, and to avoid over-fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Very low. Thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very dilute, balanced feed at the beginning of the growing season.
