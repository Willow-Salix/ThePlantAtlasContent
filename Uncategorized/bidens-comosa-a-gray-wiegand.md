## 🧤 Care Instructions
Leafy Beggarticks thrive in conditions mimicking their native temperate wetlands, requiring full to partial sun and constantly moist to wet soil. Ensure it never dries out and provide moderate fertility for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertility, as native wetland soils are often rich in organic matter. A balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
