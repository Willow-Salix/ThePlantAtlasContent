## Care Guide
This terrestrial orchid thrives in conditions mimicking its tropical montane forest habitat, requiring bright, indirect light and consistent moisture with excellent drainage. Fertilize lightly during active growth and ensure high humidity. Allow for a slight reduction in water during cooler periods.

### Fertilizer
Apply a dilute, balanced orchid fertilizer (e.g., quarter strength) every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. Reduce or cease fertilization during dormancy.
