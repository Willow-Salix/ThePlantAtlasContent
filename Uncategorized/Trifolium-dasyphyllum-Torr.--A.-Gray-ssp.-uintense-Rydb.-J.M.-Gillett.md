## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Uinta Mountains, Utah and Wyoming, USA |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in exposed, high-altitude environments. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow soil to dry out slightly between waterings. It thrives on consistent moisture from snowmelt and summer precipitation but also tolerates well-drained conditions, avoiding waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## Care Guide
Uinta Clover thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils typical of its native alpine habitat. Provide moderate, consistent moisture, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and avoid over-fertilizing due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; as a member of the Fabaceae family, it is a nitrogen-fixing legume and can enrich the soil itself, requiring minimal external nitrogen.
