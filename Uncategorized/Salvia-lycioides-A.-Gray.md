| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Chihuahuan Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, thriving with at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflective of its open desert and scrubland origins. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant; water infrequently once established, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, typical of desert plants. |

## Introduction
Salvia () is the largest genus of plants in the sage family Lamiaceae, with just under 1,000 species of shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and annuals. Within the Lamiaceae, Salvia is part of the tribe Mentheae within the subfamily Nepetoideae.  One of several genera commonly referred to as sage, it includes two widely used herbs, Salvia officinalis (common sage, or just "sage") and Salvia rosmarinus (rosemary, formerly Rosmarinus officinalis). 
The genus is distributed throughout the Old World and the Americas (over 900 total species), with three distinct regions of diversity: Central America and South America (approximately 600 species); Central Asia and the Mediterranean (250 species); Eastern Asia (90 species).

## Care Guide
Canyon Sage thrives in full sun and requires excellent drainage, mimicking its native arid scrubland habitat. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, to promote natural growth and flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; native soils are often poor, so excessive fertilization is not needed and can be detrimental. A light, balanced fertilizer in spring may be used if growth is very poor.
