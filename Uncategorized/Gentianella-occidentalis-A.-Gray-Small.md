## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in full to partial sun and requires moderate, consistent moisture during its active growth period, typical of subalpine meadows. It prefers lean, well-drained soils and does not require significant fertilization, mimicking its natural high-altitude habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. It is adapted to lean, nutrient-poor soils characteristic of alpine environments. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
