## 🧤 Care Instructions
Havard's Ipomopsis thrives in full sun and requires infrequent, deep watering due to its arid native climate. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, so fertilization should be minimal or unnecessary, making it a low-maintenance plant ideal for dry, sunny conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a very dilute, balanced formula during its active growth period, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.
