## Care Guide
Dicranodontium Moss thrives in cool, humid environments with low to partial sun exposure. The substrate should be kept consistently moist without being waterlogged, and high humidity is crucial. Fertilization is generally not required and can be detrimental to its delicate structure.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses typically derive sufficient nutrients from their environment (rainwater, decaying matter) and can be harmed by conventional fertilizers.
