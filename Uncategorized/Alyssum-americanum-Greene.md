## 🌱 Overview
Alyssum is a genus of over a hundred species of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, native to temperate Europe, Asia, and northern Africa, with the highest species diversity in the Mediterranean region. The genus comprises annual and perennial herbaceous plants or (rarely) small shrubs, growing to 10–100 cm tall, with oblong-oval leaves. Alyssum flowers are characteristically small and grouped in terminal clusters; they are often yellow or white colored but can be pink or purple.
The genera Lobularia, Aurinia and Odontarrhena are closely related to Alyssum and were formerly included in it. The widely cultivated species popularly known as "sweet alyssum" (Alyssum maritimum) is Lobularia maritima. The common rockery plant (Alyssum saxatile) is Aurinia saxatilis.
Alyssum foliage is used as food by the caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera, including the Gem (Orthonama obstipata). However, rabbits will not eat it.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its native semi-arid steppe origins. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid excessive fertilization as it prefers poor to moderate nutrient levels.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer needed. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. A very light, balanced application in spring is optional and rarely necessary.
