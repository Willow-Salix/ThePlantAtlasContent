## Introduction
Iresine is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It contains 20 to 25 species, all of which are native to the American tropics. The generic name is derived from the Greek word εριος (erios), meaning "wooly", referring to the trichome-covered flowers. Bloodleaf is a common name for those species that have colored foliage, and these are often cultivated as ornamental plants. Some species are additives to versions of the hallucinogenic drink ayahuasca.

## Care Guide
This tropical plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native montane forest habitat. Provide bright indirect light or partial shade, and ensure the soil remains consistently moist but well-draining. Fertilize lightly during active growth to support its vibrant foliage.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer).
