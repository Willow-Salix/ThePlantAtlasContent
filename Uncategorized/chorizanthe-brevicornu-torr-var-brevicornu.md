## 🌱 Overview
Chorizanthe is a genus of plants in the buckwheat family known generally as spineflowers. These are small, squat, herbaceous plants with spiny-looking inflorescences of flowers. The flowers may be in shades of red or yellow to white. The bracts are pointed and sometimes tipped with a hooked awn, and the inflorescence often dries into a rounded, spiny husk. Spineflowers are found in western North America and South America.
Name derivation: The word Chorizanthe comes from the Greek roots chorizo and anthos meaning "to divide," and "flower," thus meaning "divided flowers," but actually used in reference to the divided calyx.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This desert annual thrives on neglect, requiring minimal intervention. Provide full sun and extremely well-draining, lean soil, mimicking its arid native habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry completely between applications, and avoid over-fertilizing.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required; thrives in lean, well-draining soils.
