## Introduction
Garrya is a genus of flowering plants in the family Garryaceae native to Mexico, the western United States, Central America and the Greater Antilles. Common names include silk tassel and tassel bush.
They are evergreen dioecious wind-pollinated shrubs growing to 1–5 m (3–16 ft) tall. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, and are simple, leathery, dark green to gray-green, ovate, 3–15 cm (1–6 in) long, with an entire margin and a short petiole. The flowers are gray-green catkins, short and spreading when first produced in late summer; the male catkins becoming long (3–20 cm (1–8 in)) and pendulous in late winter when shedding pollen; the female catkins usually a little shorter and less pendulous. The fruit is a round dry berry containing two seeds.

## Care Guide
Silktassel thrives in a Mediterranean climate, preferring full sun and well-draining soil. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal watering, especially during dry summer months. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-draining soils and does not require heavy fertilization.
