## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia) and Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forest (specifically, moist deciduous forests) |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low light to deep shade. This moss thrives in shaded conditions, often on tree trunks or rocks, and should be protected from any direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently high humidity and constant moisture. The substrate should remain damp but never waterlogged. Frequent misting or a humid environment is crucial to simulate its native moist forest floor. |

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pterigynandrum sharpii thrives in very low light and high humidity, replicating its native moist deciduous forest habitat. Maintain consistent moisture for the substrate without waterlogging, and provide high ambient humidity. Fertilization is not generally needed and should be avoided.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low to none. Mosses obtain nutrients from rainwater and decaying organic matter; traditional fertilizers are typically unnecessary and can be harmful.
