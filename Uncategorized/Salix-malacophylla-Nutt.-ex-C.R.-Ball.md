## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Alaska south to California, primarily in montane and subalpine regions) |
| **Climate** | Cool Temperate to Subalpine Riparian |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun for optimal growth and flowering in its naturally open riparian habitats. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native habitat along streams, bogs, and wet meadows. Cannot tolerate drought conditions. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
The Softleaf Willow thrives in cool, moist, subalpine to temperate riparian environments, demanding full sun and consistently wet, well-draining soil. It is critical to prevent any periods of drought, as this plant is highly water-dependent. Provide moderate fertilization, ideally with organic matter, to maintain its health and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from soils rich in organic matter. An annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer can support robust growth, particularly if natural soil fertility is low.
