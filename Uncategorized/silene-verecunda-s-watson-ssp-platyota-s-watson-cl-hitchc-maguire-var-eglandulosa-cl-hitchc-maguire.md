## 🧤 Care Instructions
San Francisco Campion thrives in full to partial sun with excellent drainage, mimicking its native habitat. Water moderately during its active growing season in winter and spring, but reduce significantly or cease watering during dry summer dormancy. It prefers lean soils and requires minimal to no fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Native to typically lean, well-drained soils, it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, and excessive fertilization can be harmful.
