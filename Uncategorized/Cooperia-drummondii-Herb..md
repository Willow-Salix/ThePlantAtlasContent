| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern United States (including Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, New Mexico) and Northern Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Warm temperate to subtropical grasslands, prairies, and open woodlands, characterized by hot, dry periods followed by seasonal rainfall. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade; prefers full sun for robust growth and abundant flowering. |

## Care Guide
The Evening Rainlily flourishes in full sun and exceptionally well-drained soil, mimicking its native arid to semi-arid grassland environment. Water sparingly during its dormant periods and moderately during active growth, ensuring the soil dries completely between waterings. Fertilize lightly to encourage its characteristic post-rain blooms.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in early spring, or a diluted liquid feed every few weeks during the active growing season, is sufficient.
