## Introduction
Spiranthes is a genus of orchids in the subfamily Orchidoideae. They are known commonly as ladies tresses, ladies'-tresses, or lady's tresses. The genus is distributed in the Americas, Eurasia, and Australia. The genus name Spiranthes is derived from the Greek speira ("coil") and anthos ("flower"), and was inspired by the spirally arranged inflorescence.

## Care Guide
This rare orchid thrives in humid subtropical conditions, requiring consistently moist, well-drained soil and bright, indirect light. Protect it from harsh afternoon sun and provide very dilute fertilizer during its active growing season to mimic its native savanna environment.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced, dilute orchid-specific fertilizer during active growth. Native soils are not overly rich.
