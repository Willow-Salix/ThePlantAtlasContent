## Introduction
Petunia is a genus of 20 species of flowering plants of South American origin. The popular flower of the same name derived its epithet from the French, which took the word pétun, 'tobacco', from a Tupi–Guarani language. A tender perennial plant, most of the varieties seen in gardens are hybrids (Petunia × atkinsiana, also known as Petunia × hybrida).

## Care Guide
This Petunia thrives in full sun and requires consistent, moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between sessions. Regular feeding during its active growth and bloom cycle will promote abundant flowering, mirroring its vigor in subtropical grasslands.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high fertility. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season to support continuous blooming, reflecting the nutrient uptake requirements of a vigorous flowering plant in its native environment.
