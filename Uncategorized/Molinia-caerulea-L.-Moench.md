## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate Europe, extending to parts of North Africa and Western Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Heathland/Grassland, often found in damp or boggy areas, fens, and moorlands with acidic soils. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open, exposed conditions but can tolerate some afternoon shade. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, especially during the growing season, reflecting its native damp habitats. Tolerates waterlogged conditions. |

## Introduction
Molinia, or moor grass, is a genus of two species of flowering plants in the grass family, native to damp moorland in Eurasia and northern Africa. They are both herbaceous perennial grasses.
The genus is named after Juan Ignacio Molina, a 19th-century Chilean naturalist.

## Care Guide
Purple Moorgrass thrives in consistently moist, acidic soils under full sun to partial shade, mimicking its native heathland and bog environments. It requires ample water, especially during active growth, but has low to moderate fertilizer needs due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
