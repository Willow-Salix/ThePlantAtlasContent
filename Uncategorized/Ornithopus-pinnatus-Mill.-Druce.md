## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin (Southern Europe, North Africa, Western Asia) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Dry-summer subtropical climate) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its open habitat in Mediterranean scrublands and grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Water regularly during its active growing season (typically cooler months/spring), allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. It is drought-tolerant during hot, dry summers once established. |

## Introduction
Ornithopus, the bird's-foot, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It includes six species and one natural hybrid native to Europe, Macaronesia, the eastern Mediterranean, northwest Africa, and Iran, and from southern Brazil to northeastern Argentina in South America.

## Care Guide
This Mediterranean native thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its natural habitat. Provide moderate watering during its active growth in cooler months, allowing for dry periods, especially during hot summers. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it has very low fertilizer requirements.

### Fertilizer
Low. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it's a nitrogen-fixer, meaning it enriches the soil with nitrogen and requires minimal additional fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer once during active growth is sufficient if the soil is very poor.
