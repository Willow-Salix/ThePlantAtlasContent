## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, spanning from Maine south to Florida and west to Missouri and Texas. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to partial shade; it can tolerate full sun in cooler climates or with consistent moisture, but benefits from protection from intense afternoon sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial, especially during dry spells; ensure well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Rhododendron (; pl.: rhododendra), from Ancient Greek ῥόδον (rhódon), meaning "rose", and δένδρον (déndron), meaning "tree", is a very large genus of about 1,024 species of woody plants in the heath family (Ericaceae). They can be either evergreen or deciduous. Most species are native to eastern Asia and the Himalayan region, but smaller numbers occur elsewhere in Asia, and in North America, Europe and Australia.
It is the national flower of Nepal, the state flower of Washington and West Virginia in the United States, the state flower of Nagaland and Himachal Pradesh in India, the provincial flower of Jeju Province in South Korea, the provincial flower of Jiangxi in China and the state tree of Sikkim and Uttarakhand in India. Most species have brightly coloured flowers which bloom from late winter through to early summer.
Azaleas make up two subgenera of Rhododendron. They are distinguished from "true" rhododendrons by having only five anthers per flower.

## Care Guide
The Pinxterbloom Azalea thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate deciduous forest, requiring consistently moist, well-drained, and acidic soil. It prefers partial sun to partial shade, which protects it from harsh afternoon light. Fertilize sparingly with an acid-specific formula to support its growth in organic-rich soils.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with an acid-specific fertilizer formulated for azaleas or rhododendrons, typically applied in early spring. Enriching soil with organic matter is also beneficial.
