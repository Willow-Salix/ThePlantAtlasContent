## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and subarctic North America, including Alaska, Yukon, Northwest Territories, Greenland, and parts of arctic Canada |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra / Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, as it naturally grows in open, exposed alpine and arctic environments above the tree line with intense light. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture during the short growing season, provided by snowmelt, but requires excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging; tolerant of drier conditions during dormancy. |

## Introduction
Saxifraga oppositifolia, the purple saxifrage or purple mountain saxifrage, is a species of plant that is very common in the high Arctic and also some high mountainous areas further south, including northern Britain, the Alps and the Rocky Mountains.
Saxifraga oppositifolia grows at a latitude of 83°40'N on Kaffeklubben Island, making it one of the northernmost plants in the world.

## Care Guide
This arctic-alpine plant thrives in full sun and very well-drained, gritty soil that remains consistently moist during its short growing season. Minimal fertilization is required due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. Provide a cool environment and excellent drainage to mimic its native tundra habitat.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; its native soils are poor and rocky, so it is adapted to nutrient-scarce conditions. If fertilized, use a very dilute, balanced feed once early in the growing season.
