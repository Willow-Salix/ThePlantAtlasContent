## Introduction
Fraxinus (), commonly called ash, is a genus of plants in the olive and lilac family, Oleaceae, and comprises 45–65 species of usually medium-to-large trees, most of which are deciduous (dropping their leaves in autumn), although some subtropical species are evergreen. The genus is widespread throughout much of Europe, Asia, and North America.
The leaves are usually opposite, and mostly pinnately compound (divided into leaflets in a feather-like arrangement). The seeds, known as "keys", are botanically fruits of the type called samara. Some species are dioecious, having male and female flowers on separate plants.
Ash wood is strong and elastic, and used for the handles of tools. Musical instrument makers use it for electric guitars and for drum shells. The Morgan Motor Company makes the frames of sports cars from ash wood. In Greek mythology, the Meliae were the nymphs of ash trees.

## Care Guide
Pumpkin Ash thrives in very wet conditions, requiring consistently moist to waterlogged soil and tolerating frequent flooding. It prefers full sun to partial shade and will grow best in rich, fertile soil typical of its native bottomland habitats. This tree is ideal for planting in swampy areas or flood-prone sites.

### Fertilizer
Moderately rich to rich soil; benefits from the nutrient deposition typical of floodplain environments.
