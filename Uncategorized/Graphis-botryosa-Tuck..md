## Care Guide
To care for Script Lichen, replicate its native humid forest environment by providing low to medium indirect light and maintaining high ambient humidity. It absorbs moisture from the air, making consistent humidity and occasional misting vital. Traditional fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.

### Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition, rain, and dust, and can be sensitive to excess nutrients.
