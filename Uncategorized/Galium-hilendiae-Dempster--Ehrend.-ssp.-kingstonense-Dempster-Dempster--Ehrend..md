## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mojave Desert, Kingston Range, California, USA |
| **Climate** | Arid Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade (tolerates high sun exposure typical of desert environments, but may appreciate some afternoon shade in extreme heat) |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering; highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking desert rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## Care Guide
Kingston Mountains Bedstraw thrives in bright, full sun conditions, typical of its Mojave Desert origin. This highly drought-tolerant plant requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions. It prefers lean, well-draining soils and generally needs little to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Adapted to lean desert soils, so excessive fertilization is unnecessary and can be harmful. If grown in containers, a very diluted, balanced fertilizer once a year might be beneficial.
