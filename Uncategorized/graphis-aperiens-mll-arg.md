## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for this script lichen, replicate its tropical rainforest habitat by providing consistently high humidity, low light conditions, and a damp substrate. Avoid direct sunlight and do not apply any fertilizers, as these can be detrimental to its delicate symbiotic structure.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No external fertilization is typically needed or recommended, as lichens are highly sensitive to nutrient imbalances and pollution. They derive necessary nutrients from the air and their substrate.
