Geum × catlingii, or Catling's avens, is a plant in the rose family, Rosaceae.

## Care Guide
Catling's Avens thrives in cool temperate conditions with full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil and benefits from organic matter rather than heavy fertilization. Ensure adequate moisture, particularly in dry spells, to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; benefits from rich organic matter in the soil, light annual fertilization in spring if soil is poor.
