## Care Guide
The Idaho Gooseberry thrives in cool, moist conditions reminiscent of its native Pacific Northwest woodlands. It requires consistent soil moisture and performs best in partial sun to partial shade, though it can tolerate more sun with adequate water. An annual application of organic fertilizer in spring supports its healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light annual fertilization with a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer in early spring. Benefits from soil rich in organic matter.
