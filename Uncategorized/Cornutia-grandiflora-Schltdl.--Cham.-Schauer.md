## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central America (Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama), Mexico (Southwest, Southeast), Colombia, and Venezuela. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers bright indirect light to partial sun. While it can tolerate some morning sun, it should be protected from intense afternoon direct sunlight, particularly in hotter climates, as its native habitat often provides dappled light. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist, well-draining soil due to its native high rainfall environment. Water regularly and thoroughly, ensuring the soil does not dry out completely between waterings. High ambient humidity is also very beneficial. |

## Introduction
Cornutia is a genus of plants in the family Lamiaceae, first described in 1753. Species in this genus are native to tropical parts of the Western Hemisphere, including southern Mexico, Central America, the West Indies, and northern South America.

## Care Guide
This tropical shrub thrives in conditions mimicking its native wet forest habitat, requiring bright indirect light, consistently moist yet well-draining soil, and high humidity. Provide regular fertilization during its active growth period to encourage vibrant blooms and healthy foliage, protecting it from intense direct sun.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer) to support its vigorous growth and abundant flowering in relatively nutrient-rich tropical soils.
