## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Rocky Mountains of North America (specifically high elevations in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Montana, and Idaho) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine and Alpine Meadows, Open Woodlands (Temperate Mountain Climate) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Prefers full sun in cooler climates or higher elevations, but benefits from afternoon shade in hotter regions to protect from scorching. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil. Regular watering is essential, especially during dry periods, to prevent the soil from drying out completely. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Aquilegia, commonly known as columbines, is a genus of perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae (buttercups). The genus includes between 80 and 400 taxa (described species and subspecies) with natural ranges across the Northern Hemisphere. Natural and introduced populations of Aquilegia exist on all continents but Antarctica. Known for their high physical variability and ease of hybridization, columbines are popular garden plants and have been used to create many cultivated varieties.
Aquilegia typically possess stiff stems and leaves that divide into multiple leaflets. Columbines often have colorful flowers with five sepals and five petals. The petals generally feature nectar spurs which differ in lengths between species. In North America, morphological variations in spurs evolved to suit different pollinators. Some species and varieties of columbines are naturally spurless. In cultivation, varieties bearing significantly altered physical traits such as double flowering are prevalent.
Associated with fertility goddesses in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, archeological evidence suggests Aquilegia were in cultivation by the 2nd century AD in Roman Britain. Despite often being toxic, columbines have been used by humans as herbal remedies, perfume, and food. Asian traditional medicine, Indigenous North Americans, and Medieval Europeans have considered portions of the plants to have medicinal uses. Selective breeding and hybridization of columbines has occurred for centuries, with exchanges between Old and New World species creating further diversity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To mimic its native mountain habitat, provide this columbine with well-drained, consistently moist soil and a location with full sun to partial shade. Ensure regular watering, especially in warmer months, and apply a light, balanced fertilizer in spring for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. Thrives in moderately fertile soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring, or enriching the soil with compost, is generally sufficient. Avoid excessive fertilization.
