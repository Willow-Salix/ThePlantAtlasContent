## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eurasia (Europe and Asia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is ideal, promoting vigorous growth and seed production. Tolerates partial sun but may result in less robust plants. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil, typical of agricultural fields or disturbed temperate areas. While somewhat drought-tolerant once established, regular watering during dry spells will ensure optimal growth. |

## Introduction
Setaria is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family. The name is derived from the Latin word seta, meaning "bristle" or "hair", which refers to the bristly spikelets.
The genus includes over 100 species distributed in many tropical and temperate regions around the world, and members are commonly known as foxtail or bristle grasses.

## Care Guide
As a resilient annual grass native to Eurasian temperate grasslands and disturbed areas, Green Foxtail thrives in full sun and prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil. It exhibits low to moderate fertilizer needs, making it adaptable to various soil conditions with minimal care.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a common weed, it is adapted to a wide range of soil fertility and generally does not require heavy fertilization. It can thrive in nutrient-poor soils but benefits from average fertility.
