## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (southeastern California, Arizona), northwestern Mexico (Baja California, Sonora) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring intense direct sunlight for optimal growth and flowering. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to root rot in consistently moist conditions. |

## Introduction
Dalea  is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. Members of the genus are commonly known as prairie clover or indigo bush. Its name honors English apothecary Samuel Dale (1659–1739). They are native to the Western hemisphere, where they are distributed from Canada to Argentina. Nearly half of the known species are endemic to Mexico. Two species of Dalea (Dalea ornata and Dalea searlsiae) have been considered for rangeland restoration.

## Care Guide
This desert native requires full sun exposure and is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent watering with well-draining soil. It thrives in poor soil conditions and has very low fertilizer requirements, making it a low-maintenance plant for arid landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; thrives in lean, well-draining soils and generally does not require regular fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
