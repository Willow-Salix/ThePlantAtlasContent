## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | New Zealand |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Subalpine Tussock Grasslands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring bright light conditions typical of exposed mountain environments. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistent moisture, but absolutely critical to ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. Tolerates some drought once established. |

## Introduction
Aciphylla is a genus of about 40 species of herbaceous plants in the family Apiaceae, all but two of them endemic to New Zealand (the remaining two species are found only in Australia). They range from small cushion plants to tall flower spikes surrounded by rosettes of stiff, pointed leaves, the latter probably adaptations to prevent browsing by moa. Their common name is speargrass or Spaniard. Most Aciphylla species preferred habitats are in subalpine or alpine habitats in the South Island. Fragrant oil extracted from some large species, known as taramea, is still used as a perfume by Māori.

## Care Guide
Fierce Spaniard (Aciphylla) thrives in conditions mimicking its native New Zealand alpine environment. It requires full sun, consistently moist but extremely well-drained soil, and very minimal fertilization. Ensure protection from extreme wetness combined with poor drainage.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. These plants are adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of alpine regions and can be damaged by excessive fertilization.
