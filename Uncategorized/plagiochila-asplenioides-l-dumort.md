# Greater Plagiochila
### *Plagiochila asplenioides (L.) Dumort.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across temperate and boreal regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Forest (found in humid, shaded microclimates within these forests). |
| **☀️ Light** | Very low light to deep shade. It grows on forest floors, tree bases, and shaded rocks, requiring protection from any direct sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistently moist substrate and extremely high atmospheric humidity. As a liverwort, it lacks true roots and absorbs water directly. Frequent misting or cultivation in a closed terrarium is essential; never allow it to dry out. |

## 🌱 Overview
Plagiochila is a large, common, and widespread genus of liverworts in the order Jungermanniales. It is a member of the family  Plagiochilaceae within that order. There may be anywhere from 500 to 1300 species, most of them from the tropics; the exact number is still under revision.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This primitive plant thrives in conditions mimicking its forest floor habitat: consistently high humidity, constantly moist substrate, and very low light levels. Avoid direct sun and dry air at all costs, and fertilization is rarely needed due to its minimal nutrient requirements.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low to none. Liverworts thrive in nutrient-poor environments. If desired, a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/8 to 1/4 strength) can be applied very sparingly once or twice a year, but is generally unnecessary.
