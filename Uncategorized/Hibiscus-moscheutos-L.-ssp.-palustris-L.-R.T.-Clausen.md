## Introduction
Hibiscus is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. The genus is quite large, comprising several hundred species that are native to warm temperate, subtropical and tropical regions throughout the world. Member species are renowned for their large, showy flowers and those species are commonly known simply as "hibiscus", or less widely known as rose mallow. The genus includes both annual and perennial herbaceous plants, as well as woody shrubs and small trees.
Several species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants, notably Hibiscus syriacus and Hibiscus × rosa-sinensis.

## Care Guide
The Swamp Rose Mallow thrives in full sun and requires abundant water, mimicking its native marshy habitats. Maintain consistently moist to wet soil and provide regular fertilization throughout the growing season for optimal growth and prolific blooms. This plant is well-suited for wet areas or containers where its moisture needs can be met.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to high fertilizer needs. Native wetland soils are often rich in organic matter. Fertilize regularly during the growing season with a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer to support its vigorous growth and abundant flowering.
