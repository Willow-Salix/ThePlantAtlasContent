## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Wet montane regions across Central and South America, including Mexico, Central America, various Caribbean islands, and countries like Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Montane Wet Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial to full shade; requires indirect, dappled light similar to an understory plant in a dense forest canopy. Avoid direct, harsh sunlight. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is crucial. Keep the soil continuously damp but not waterlogged, mimicking the high rainfall and humidity of its native habitat. High ambient humidity is also beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Blechnum, known as hard fern, is a genus of ferns in the family Blechnaceae, subfamily Blechnoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Two very different circumscriptions of the genus are used by different authors. In the PPG I system, based on Gasper et al. (2016), Blechnum is one of 18 genera in the subfamily Blechnoideae, and has about 30 species. Other sources use a very broadly defined Blechnum s.l., including accepting only two other genera in the subfamily. The genus then has about 250 species. In the PPG I circumscription, the genus is mostly neotropical,  with a few southern African species.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fern thrives in conditions mimicking its native tropical montane wet forest environment, requiring consistent moisture, high humidity, and protection from direct sunlight. Provide partial to full shade and keep the soil consistently damp. Fertilize sparingly with a diluted, balanced fern fertilizer during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeder. Use a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer formulated for ferns every 2-4 weeks during the growing season. Avoid over-fertilizing, which can harm the plant.
