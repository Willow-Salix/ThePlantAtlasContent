## Introduction

## Care Guide
Brack's Sclerocactus thrives in full sun and requires very infrequent watering, completely drying out between cycles. It needs well-draining soil and minimal fertilization, mimicking its native high desert conditions to prevent root rot and encourage healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low; feed sparingly with a specialized cactus fertilizer, diluted to half strength, once or twice during its active growing season (spring to early summer).
