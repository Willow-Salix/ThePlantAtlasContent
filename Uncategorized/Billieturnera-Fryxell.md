## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Bolivia, South America |
| **Climate** | Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial shade, requiring bright light for optimal growth, similar to its exposure in open or semi-open tropical environments. |
| **Watering** | Water regularly and thoroughly during its active growing season (spring and summer), allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. Significantly reduce watering frequency during cooler, dormant periods to simulate its native dry season. |

## Care Guide
This plant thrives with bright light and a pronounced wet/dry cycle. Provide consistent watering during its growing season, allowing for slight drying between waterings, and reduce water significantly in cooler months. Fertilize moderately during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize moderately during the active growing season (spring to late summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, perhaps every 2-4 weeks. Cease fertilization during its dormant phase.
