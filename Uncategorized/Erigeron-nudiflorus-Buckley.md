## 🧤 Care Instructions
Nakedstem Fleabane thrives in full sun to partial shade with moderate, consistent watering, allowing for slight drying between sessions. It prefers well-draining soil and is not a heavy feeder, tolerating nutrient-poor conditions. This mimics its natural environment in the open woodlands and pine barrens of the southeastern United States.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer, as it is adapted to the often nutrient-poor sandy soils of its native pine barrens and open woodlands.
