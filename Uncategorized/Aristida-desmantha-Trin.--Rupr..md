## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South-central United States (e.g., Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona) and northern Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Semi-arid Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily); adapted to open, treeless environments. |
| **Watering** | Low; highly drought-tolerant. Requires infrequent watering, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings, especially once established. |

## Introduction
Aristida is a very nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. Aristida is distinguished by having three awns (bristles) on each lemma of each floret. The genus includes about 300 species found worldwide, often in arid warm regions. This genus is among those colloquially called three-awns wiregrasses, speargrasses and needlegrasses. The name Aristida is derived from the Latin "arista", meaning "awn".
They are characteristic of semiarid grassland. The Wiregrass Region of North America is named for A. stricta. Other locales where this genus is an important component of the ecosystem include the Carolina Bays, the sandhills of the Carolinas, and elsewhere, Mulga scrub in Australia, and the xeric grasslands around Lake Turkana in Africa. Local increases in the abundance of wiregrasses is a good indicator of overgrazing, as livestock avoid them.

## Care Guide
Curly Threeawn, a resilient grass from the semi-arid grasslands of the South-central U.S., thrives in full sun and is exceptionally drought-tolerant. It requires minimal watering once established and prefers nutrient-poor soils, making it an ideal, low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Very low; adapted to poor to moderately fertile, often sandy or rocky soils. Fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental.
