## Care Guide
Phlox Heliotrope thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native semi-arid grasslands. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent deep watering once established. Fertilizer needs are minimal, making it a low-maintenance plant for dry, sunny locations.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. In its native lean, sandy soils, it thrives without rich nutrients. A light, balanced fertilizer may be applied sparingly if growth appears weak, especially in containers.
