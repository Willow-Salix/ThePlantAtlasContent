## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal Southern California, USA and Baja California, Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland/Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers full sun, reflecting its open, exposed native habitat in chaparral and coastal sage scrub environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Extremely drought-tolerant once established. Requires infrequent watering, primarily during winter dry spells, and minimal to no supplemental water in summer due to its adaptation to hot, dry Mediterranean summers. |

## 🌱 Overview
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Del Mar Manzanita thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, mimicking its native Mediterranean chaparral. It is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent winter watering and no summer irrigation once established, and generally requires no fertilizer.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally does not require fertilizer; it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. If absolutely necessary, use a very low-phosphorus formula and apply sparingly to avoid nutrient imbalance.
