## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | West Tropical Africa (e.g., Nigeria, Cameroon) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Wet and Dry / Tropical Savanna |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native tropical savanna environment, it typically receives strong direct sunlight but can also tolerate some shade, particularly from midday sun in very hot climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture, especially during the growing season. Native climate with distinct wet and dry seasons suggests it appreciates regular watering but also requires good drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Thunbergia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It includes 150 species native to tropical and subtropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, southern Asia, New Guinea, and Australia. Thunbergia species are vigorous annual or perennial vines and shrubs growing to 2–8 m tall. The generic name honours the Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg (1743-1828).
Its members are known by various names, including thunbergias and clockvine. Thunbergia on its own usually refers to Thunbergia grandiflora, while Thunbergia alata is often known as black-eyed Susan vine or just black-eyed Susan (not to be confused with other flowers called black-eyed Susan). Orange clockvine is the name of Thunbergia gregorii.
Thunbergias are frequent garden escapes, becoming invasive species; T. grandiflora, T. fragrans, and T. laurifolia are considered weeds in Australia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Bush Clockvine, native to West Tropical Africa, thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide regular watering, especially during warm months, and fertilize regularly during the growing season to support its vigorous growth and abundant flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate to high. Being a vigorous bloomer and grower in tropical soils, it benefits from regular feeding with a balanced fertilizer, particularly during its active growth and flowering periods.
