## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, reflecting its Mediterranean origins. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and fertilize minimally as it prefers lean conditions. It is generally low maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. It thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils and does not require frequent feeding. Over-fertilization can reduce flowering.
