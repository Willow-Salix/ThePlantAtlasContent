## Care Guide
Rock Gilia thrives in full sun and very dry conditions, typical of its native arid scrubland and desert habitats. It requires minimal watering, preferring to dry out completely between sessions, and generally needs no fertilization, adapting well to lean, well-drained soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary and can be detrimental.
