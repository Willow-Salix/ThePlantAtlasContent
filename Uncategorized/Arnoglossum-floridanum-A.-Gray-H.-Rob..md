## Introduction
Arnoglossum is a North American genus of plants in the family Asteraceae, described as a genus in 1817. They have the common name Indian plantain because they resemble the unrelated common plantain (Plantago spp.).
Arnoglossum is a member of the tribe Senecioneae which has been undergoing extensive revisions in recent years. Many of the species now in the genus were formerly classified in other genera such as Cacalia, Mesadenia, and Senecio. The remaining species are all native to North America (Ontario and eastern United States).
The name Arnoglossum is from the Greek word "arnos" meaning lamb, and "glossum" meaning tongue and is the  ancient name for some species of Plantago.

## Care Guide
This plant is adapted to the open, sunny, and well-drained sandy soils of Florida's pine flatwoods and scrublands. Provide full sun exposure and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. It has low fertilizer needs, reflecting its native habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adaptable to nutrient-poor, sandy soils. A light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if desired.
