## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily California and parts of Nevada) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to mimic its open desert habitat. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent watering. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as it is highly drought-tolerant and susceptible to root rot with excessive moisture. |

## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun conditions and demands minimal watering, making it ideal for xeriscaping or arid gardens. It prefers well-draining soil and has very low fertilizer requirements. Avoid overwatering to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. If planted in native-like well-draining, nutrient-poor soil, fertilization is generally not required. If grown in a more cultivated setting, a very light, balanced fertilizer application once a year in spring is sufficient.
