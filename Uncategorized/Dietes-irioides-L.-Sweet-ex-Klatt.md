## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern and Eastern Africa (e.g., South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Zimbabwe) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Subtropical Grassland and Woodland Margins with Seasonal Rainfall |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in at least 6 hours of direct sun but tolerates dappled light or light shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistently moist soil, particularly during active growth periods and dry spells. Tolerant of some drought once established, but prefers not to dry out completely. Requires well-draining soil. |

## Introduction
Dietes is a genus of six rhizomatous plant species of the iris family Iridaceae, first described collectively in 1866. Common names for the  different species include wood iris, fortnight lily, African iris, Japanese iris and butterfly iris. Globally, these common names may differ from region to region, and may also apply to one or more species within Dietes.
Most of the Dietes are endemic to southern and central Africa; one (Dietes robinsoniana) is native to Lord Howe Island, off the eastern Pacific coast of Australia. A few others—primarily Dietes bicolor, D. grandiflora and D. iridioides—have become popular gardening and  landscaping plants around the world, and have thus inevitably naturalised in areas outside of their natural range, including across much of the Americas, from the United States (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, South Carolina, Southern California and the Bay Area, Texas) through Mexico and much of Central and South America, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Hispaniola and Jamaica. Elsewhere, these species have been documented in the Azores, the Canary Islands, Madeira, southern France, Spain, Portugal, Sicily, Israel, Istanbul, Palestine, Madagascar, Mauritius, Réunion, St. Helena, Hong Kong, Java (Indonesia), Sikkim (India), Singapore, Taiwan, and Tokyo, Japan. They are also found in Australia (near Adelaide and Perth, and much of New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, and Victoria), New Caledonia and New Zealand.

## Care Guide
The African Iris thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring consistently moist but well-draining soil. While established plants are somewhat drought-tolerant, regular watering enhances performance and flowering. Feed lightly in spring to support robust growth and abundant blooms.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. A balanced, all-purpose granular fertilizer applied once in early spring, or a diluted liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season, is generally sufficient.
