## Introduction
Mimulus , also known as monkeyflowers, is a plant genus in the family Phrymaceae, which was traditionally placed in family Scrophulariaceae. The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. 
Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Care Guide
Tolmie's Monkeyflower thrives in cool, consistently wet environments, much like its native montane stream and seep habitats. It needs full sun to partial shade and requires constantly moist to wet soil, never allowing it to dry out. Fertilize lightly with a diluted, balanced feed during its growing period.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization. A balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the active growing season, or a slow-release granular fertilizer once a year.
