| **Native Origin** | Western North America (British Columbia south through California, east to Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Woodland / Forest Understory |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to dappled sun, especially in warmer climates; can tolerate full sun in consistently moist, cooler conditions. |
| **Watering** | Regular and consistent watering, keeping the soil moist but not waterlogged, particularly during its active growing season in spring. Tolerates some drying out in dormancy. |

## Introduction
Montia is a genus of plants in the family Montiaceae. Species in this genus are known generally as miner's lettuce or water chickweed. All of the species in the genus have edible leaves. It is found worldwide, except in Asia.
Montias are known from fossilized seeds recovered from sediments of the Pleistocene Tomales Formation and from a small paleoflora at San Bruno. Further, Daniel Axelrod discussed Montia howellii as one of the biogeographically significant species comprising the Millerton paleoflora at Tomales.
The genus name of Montia is in honour of Giuseppe Monti (1682–1760), an Italian chemist and botanist. It was first described and published in Sp. Pl. on page 87 in 1753.
Montia perfoliata, now Claytonia perfoliata, the species for which the term miner's lettuce was coined, is distributed throughout the Mountain West of North America in moist soils and prefers areas which have been recently disturbed. The species got its name due to its use as a fresh salad green by miners in the 1849 California Gold Rush.
Selected species:

Montia australasica - white purslane

## Care Guide
This annual plant thrives in partial shade with consistently moist soil, mimicking its native woodland understory habitat. Ensure regular watering, especially during its spring growth, and provide moderate soil fertility for optimal development.

### Fertilizer
Generally not a heavy feeder. A light, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied during its active growth phase (spring) if soil nutrients are low.
