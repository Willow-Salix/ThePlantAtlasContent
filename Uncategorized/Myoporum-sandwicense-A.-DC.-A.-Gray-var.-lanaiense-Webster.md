## Care Guide
This Hawaiian native variety thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering. It adapts well to various soil types and has low fertilization needs, making it a resilient and low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Typically does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may benefit plants in very poor soils.
