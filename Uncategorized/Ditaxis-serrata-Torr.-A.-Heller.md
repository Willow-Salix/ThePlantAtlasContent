## Introduction
Ditaxis is a plant genus of the family Euphorbiaceae first described as a genus in 1824. Its name comes from Greek dis ("two") and taxis ("rank"), referring to the stamens which are in two whorls. The genus is widespread across much of the Western Hemisphere from the southern United States to Uruguay.

## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires very little water, tolerating long periods of drought. Ensure excellent drainage and provide lean soil, as it is not accustomed to rich, constantly moist conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically requires minimal fertilization, perhaps a balanced, diluted fertilizer once a year in spring if grown in poor soil.
