## Care Guide
This alpine species demands cool temperatures and abundant light, mimicking its high-altitude origins. Ensure consistently moist, exceptionally well-drained soil, and avoid over-fertilization, as it thrives in lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Native to lean, often rocky soils, this plant does not require rich fertilization. If growth is poor, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer might be applied sparingly.
