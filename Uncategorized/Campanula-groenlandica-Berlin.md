## Introduction
Campanula () is the type genus of the Campanulaceae family of flowering plants. Campanula are commonly known as bellflowers and take both their common and scientific names from the bell-shaped flowers—campanula is Latin for "little bell".
The genus includes over 500 species and several subspecies, distributed across the temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with centers of diversity in the Mediterranean region, Balkans, Caucasus and mountains of western Asia. The range also extends into mountains in tropical regions of Asia and Africa.

The species include annual, biennial and perennial plants, and vary in habit from dwarf arctic and alpine species under 5 cm high, to large temperate grassland and woodland species growing to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall.

## Care Guide
The Greenland Harebell is an Arctic plant thriving in cold, exposed conditions. Provide full sun and ensure excellent drainage, with moderate watering strictly during its brief summer growing period. Minimal to no fertilization is necessary due to its adaptation to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, lean soils; excessive fertilization can be harmful.
