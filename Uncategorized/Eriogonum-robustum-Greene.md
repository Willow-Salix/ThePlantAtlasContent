## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | California, USA (specifically Sierra Nevada foothills and inner North Coast Ranges) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (Chaparral, Arid Scrubland) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily); thrives in hot, exposed conditions. |
| **💧 Water** | Low to very low; highly drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during the summer dry season. |

## 🌱 Overview
Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat.  This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing.  It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).
The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (E. tomentosum) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ("planta lanata, geniculata"). Despite sharing the common name "buckwheat", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.
In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened.  One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This highly drought-tolerant native thrives in full sun and very lean, well-draining soils, mimicking its natural dry, rocky California habitats. Provide minimal water once established and avoid rich fertilization to ensure its health and promote abundant flowering. It's an ideal choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low; thrives in lean, infertile, well-draining soils. Avoid rich fertilizers, as they can hinder flowering and overall plant vigor.
