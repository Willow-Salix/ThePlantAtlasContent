## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean Sea (coastal regions of Southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Marine Sublittoral Zone |
| **☀️ Light** | High light exposure within its aquatic environment, typically found in clear, shallow to moderately deep coastal waters (1-40 meters) where photosynthesis is optimal. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires constant submersion in stable, clean, and properly salinized marine water; terrestrial watering schedules are not applicable. |

## 🌱 Overview
Posidonia is a genus of flowering plants. It contains nine species of marine plants ("seagrass"), found in the seas of the Mediterranean and around the south coast of Australia.
The APG system (1998) and APG II system (2003) accept this genus as constituting the sole genus in the family Posidoniaceae, which it places in the order Alismatales, in the clade monocots. The AP-Website concludes that the three families Cymodoceaceae, Posidoniaceae and Ruppiaceae form a monophyletic group. Earlier systems classified this genus in the family Potamogetonaceae or in the family Posidoniaceae but belonging to order Zosterales.
Posidonia oceanica has nitrogen fixation capabilities via symbiosis and other species may as well.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
As a marine seagrass, Posidonia oceanica demands a stable temperate marine aquarium environment with high water clarity and sufficient light penetration. Successful care involves maintaining specific water parameters (salinity, temperature) and providing an appropriate sandy or muddy substrate for its extensive rhizome system.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Obtains essential nutrients from both the surrounding marine water column and the substrate (sandy or muddy bottoms); thrives in nutrient-rich marine environments.
