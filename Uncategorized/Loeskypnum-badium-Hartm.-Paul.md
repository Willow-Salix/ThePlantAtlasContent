# Loeskypnum Moss

*Loeskypnum badium (Hartm.) Paul* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumboreal: Northern Europe (e.g., Scandinavia), Asia (e.g., Siberia), North America (e.g., Canada, Alaska), and Greenland. Primarily found in peatlands, bogs, and fens. |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest/Taiga and Subarctic/Alpine Tundra, specifically within waterlogged bog and fen ecosystems. |
| **Sunlight** | Moderate to bright indirect light. Tolerates partial shade but avoid intense, direct sun, which can quickly dry it out. |
| **Watering** | Keep substrate consistently moist to wet, never allowing it to dry out, as its native habitat is waterlogged. Requires very high ambient humidity. |

## Care Guide
Loeskypnum moss thrives in consistently cool, moist, and highly humid environments, mimicking its native bog habitats. It requires moderate to bright indirect light and should never be allowed to dry out. Fertilization is rarely needed, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Its native bog environments are extremely nutrient-poor, so it is sensitive to high fertilizer concentrations.
