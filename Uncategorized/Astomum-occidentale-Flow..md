## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (including Western United States and British Columbia, Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Chaparral (characterized by seasonally moist conditions, often with dry summers) |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun (prefers sites with morning sun or dappled light rather than intense, prolonged afternoon sun) |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist during active growth, allowing the top layer of the substrate to dry slightly between waterings. Tolerates brief periods of dryness, potentially entering dormancy. |

## Care Guide
Western astomum moss thrives in bright indirect to partial sun, requiring consistent moisture especially during its active growing season, though it can tolerate brief dry spells. It has very low nutrient needs, making regular fertilization largely unnecessary. Ensure good drainage and avoid prolonged waterlogging for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; mosses generally have very low nutrient needs. If desired, a highly diluted balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly, but is often unnecessary.
