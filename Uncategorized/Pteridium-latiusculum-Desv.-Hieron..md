## Introduction
Bracken (Pteridium) is a genus of large, cosmopolitan, coarse ferns in the family Dennstaedtiaceae. Ferns (Pteridophyta) are vascular plants that undergo alternation of generations, having both large plants (sporophytes) that produce spores and small plants (gametophytes) that produce sex cells (eggs and sperm) in its life cycle. Brackens are noted for their large, highly divided leaves. They are found on all continents except Antarctica, though their typical habitat is moorland.  The genus probably has the widest distribution of any fern in the world. 
The word bracken is of Old Norse origin, related to Swedish bräken and Danish bregne, both meaning fern. In the past, the genus was commonly treated as having only one species, Pteridium aquilinum, but the recent trend is to subdivide it into about ten species.
Like other ferns, brackens do not have seeds or fruit, but reproduce by spores. The immature fronds, known as fiddleheads, are sometimes eaten, although some are thought to be carcinogenic.

## Care Guide
This highly adaptable fern prefers a wide range of light conditions from full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is very low-maintenance, requiring minimal fertilization, and is known for its vigorous growth and ability to colonize various temperate environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. While it can thrive in poor, acidic soils, a light application of a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season can promote vigorous growth.
