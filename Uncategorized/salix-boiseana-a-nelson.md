## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Boise Willow thrives in full sun and demands consistently moist to wet soil, reflecting its native riparian and subalpine wetland habitats. Ensure abundant water availability and provide ample light for optimal health. Fertilizer needs are typically low, especially in naturally rich, moist soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally thrives in average, well-draining to moist soil. A balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring can benefit growth, especially in poor soils.
