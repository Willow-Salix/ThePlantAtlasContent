## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Subarctic and Arctic regions of North America (Alaska, Canada), Greenland, and northeastern Asia (Siberia, Russian Far East) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun, especially during its short growing season, mimicking the open exposure of alpine environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially when actively growing, to replicate meltwater and summer rains without waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Corydalis (from Greek korydalís "crested lark") is a genus of about 540 species of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Papaveraceae, native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere and the high mountains of tropical eastern Africa. They are most diverse in China and the Himalayas, with at least 357 species in China. Corydalis species are the only dicots having only a single cotyledon (seed leaf).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in cool, bright conditions with consistently moist, well-drained soil, similar to its alpine and arctic native habitat. Provide full to partial sun and avoid rich, heavy soils. Fertilization should be light, as it is adapted to nutrient-scarce environments.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization; an annual application of a very dilute, balanced fertilizer or incorporation of light organic matter is sufficient, as native soils are often nutrient-poor.
