## Care Guide
As a saxicolous (rock-dwelling) lichen, this organism thrives on exposed rock surfaces in temperate regions. It requires regular atmospheric moisture but is highly tolerant of prolonged dry periods, obtaining all nutrients from the air and its substrate.

### Fertilizer
Not required; obtains all necessary nutrients directly from atmospheric deposition and its rock substrate.
