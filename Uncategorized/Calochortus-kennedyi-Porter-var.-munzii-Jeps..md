## Care Guide
To care for the Desert Mariposa Lily, provide full sun and extremely well-draining, lean soil that mimics its native arid scrubland habitat. Water sparingly only during its winter/spring growing season, ensuring complete dryness throughout its summer dormancy to prevent bulb rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. It thrives in lean, well-draining desert soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
