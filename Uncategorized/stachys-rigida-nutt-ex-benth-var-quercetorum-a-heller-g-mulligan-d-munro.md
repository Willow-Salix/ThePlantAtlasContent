## 🧤 Care Instructions
Adapted to California's Mediterranean oak woodlands, Rough Hedgenettle thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent deep watering, and generally needs low fertilization to flourish.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to poor, well-draining soils. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if the soil is particularly lean.
