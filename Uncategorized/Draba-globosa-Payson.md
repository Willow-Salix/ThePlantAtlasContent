| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Requires high light exposure, especially in cooler climates, but may benefit from afternoon shade in extremely hot areas to protect roots. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, with absolutely essential excellent drainage. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic its rocky, well-drained alpine habitat. Drought tolerant once established. |

## Care Guide
Beavertip Draba thrives in bright, full sun conditions and requires excellent drainage, typical of its alpine rocky habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and use fertilizer very sparingly due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils; over-fertilization can be detrimental. A very lean, well-draining soil mix is preferred.
