## 🧤 Care Instructions
Beavertip Draba thrives in bright, full sun conditions and requires excellent drainage, typical of its alpine rocky habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and use fertilizer very sparingly due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils; over-fertilization can be detrimental. A very lean, well-draining soil mix is preferred.
