## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Indian subcontinent (e.g., India, Bangladesh, Pakistan) and parts of Southeast Asia |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Monsoon/Savanna |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) is essential to replicate its native open field growing conditions and promote optimal yield. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is crucial, especially during flowering and pod development, mimicking the heavy rainfall of its native monsoon climate. Water regularly to keep the soil moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. |

## Care Guide
Mung beans flourish in warm, tropical environments with abundant direct sunlight and consistent moisture, especially during their growth phases. Provide well-draining soil and avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization due to their natural nitrogen-fixing capabilities.

### Fertilizer
As a legume, mung beans fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, reducing the need for high-nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced fertilizer or compost at planting is beneficial, focusing on phosphorus and potassium if soil tests indicate deficiencies; healthy soil rich in organic matter is preferred.
