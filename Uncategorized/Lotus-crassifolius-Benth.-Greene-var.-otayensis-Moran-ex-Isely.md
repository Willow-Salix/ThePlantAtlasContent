## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern California, USA and Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Chaparral and Coastal Sage Scrub |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) is crucial, reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant once established. Water deeply but infrequently during the cooler, rainy season (winter/spring) and reduce significantly or cease watering during hot, dry summers to mimic native dormancy. |

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its native Mediterranean scrubland. Water sparingly, primarily during cooler months, and avoid heavy fertilization due to its natural nitrogen-fixing abilities.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Fertilization is generally not required; if growth is poor, apply a very light, balanced fertilizer once in early spring.
