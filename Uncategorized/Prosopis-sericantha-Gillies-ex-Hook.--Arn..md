## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arid and semi-arid regions of Argentina (specifically Catamarca, Córdoba, La Rioja, Mendoza, San Juan, San Luis, Santiago del Estero, Tucumán). |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Monte Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring intense direct sunlight for optimal growth and flowering, typical of its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Low water needs; highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between infrequent, deep waterings, mimicking sporadic rainfall patterns in its native climate. |

## Introduction
Prosopis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. The current circumscription of the genus contains three species found in northern Africa, the Middle East, Central and South Asia. Previously it also contained around 40 species of spiny trees and shrubs found in subtropical and tropical regions of the Americas and Africa, now mostly placed in genera Strombocarpa and Neltuma. They often thrive in arid soil and are resistant to drought, on occasion developing extremely deep root systems. Their wood is usually hard, dense and durable. Their fruits are pods and may contain large amounts of sugar. The generic name means "burdock" in late Latin and originated in the Greek language.

## Care Guide
This highly drought-tolerant species flourishes in full, direct sun, mimicking its native arid scrubland environment in Argentina. It requires infrequent deep watering and thrives in lean soils with very low fertilizer needs, making it a low-maintenance plant adapted to harsh, dry conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and, as a legume, can fix its own nitrogen. Minimal to no fertilization is required once established.
