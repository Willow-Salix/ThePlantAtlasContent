## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thickleaf Phlox prefers a site with partial shade to full sun, thriving best with some afternoon shade in warmer regions. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil, especially during dry periods, reflecting its native humid woodland environment. Fertilize moderately in spring with a balanced formula or enrich the soil with organic matter.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring or an annual amendment of the soil with compost to maintain fertility.
