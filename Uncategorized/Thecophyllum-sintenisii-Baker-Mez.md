## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Puerto Rico and Hispaniola (Dominican Republic, Haiti) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Montane Rainforest / Cloud Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light; protect from direct harsh sun, especially during midday. Can tolerate partial shade. |
| **Watering** | Keep the substrate consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. High humidity (70-80% or more) is essential, achieved through misting, humidity trays, or terrarium environments. |

## Introduction
Guzmania (tufted airplant) is a genus of over 120 species of flowering plants in the botanical family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Tillandsioideae. They are mainly stemless, evergreen, epiphytic perennials native to Brazil, southern Mexico, Central America, and northern and western South America. They are found at altitudes of up to 3,500 m (11,483 ft) in the Andean rainforests.
The genus is named after Spanish-Ecuadorian pharmacist and naturalist, Anastasio Guzmán.
Several species of this genus are cultivated as indoor and outdoor garden plants. The best known is Guzmania lingulata (scarlet star) which bears orange and red bracts.
The plant dies after it has produced its flowers in summer, but new plants can easily be propagated from the offsets which appear as the parent plant dies. They are epiphytes and can do well if tied on to pieces of bark with roots bound into sphagnum moss.
Guzmanias require warm temperatures and relatively high humidity. The ascomycete fungus Cochliobolus sativus and other pathogens can cause fatal root rot in plants of this genus if the roots get too wet and cold.

## Care Guide
Thecophyllum sintenisii thrives in conditions replicating its native tropical cloud forest habitat, requiring bright, indirect light and extremely high humidity. Maintain consistent moisture in a well-draining medium and provide light fertilization during its growing period to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a weak liquid fertilizer (1/4 to 1/2 strength) applied to the leaves or roots during the active growing season (spring and summer). Epiphytes are not heavy feeders.
