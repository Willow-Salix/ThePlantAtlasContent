## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for this subarctic plant, replicate its cool, exposed native environment. Provide full sun to partial shade, ensure the soil is consistently moist but well-drained, and fertilize sparingly to avoid nutrient excess.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low; native soils are typically lean. A very diluted, balanced fertilizer can be applied once early in the growing season, but over-fertilization should be avoided.
