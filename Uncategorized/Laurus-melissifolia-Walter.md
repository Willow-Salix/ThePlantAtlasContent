| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily in states like Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Humid Subtropical Wetlands / Moist Bottomland Forests |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to full sun; it often grows in the understory or along the edges of moist forests, benefiting from protection from intense afternoon sun, especially in warmer climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil; this plant thrives in conditions where the soil rarely dries out and can tolerate periods of standing water, mimicking its native wetland habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Lindera melissifolia, common name pondberry or southern spicebush, is a stoloniferous, deciduous, aromatic shrub in the laurel family. This endangered species is native to the southeastern United States, and its demise is associated with habitat loss from extensive drainage of wetlands for agriculture and forestry. Restoration efforts are currently being conducted.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Pondberry thrives in consistently moist to wet, rich, and acidic soil, replicating its native wetland habitats. It prefers partial shade to full sun but benefits from protection during intense afternoon heat. Ensure ample water and moderate fertilization for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate. It benefits from rich, organic soil. If the soil is poor, a slow-release, balanced fertilizer can be applied in spring, or amend the soil with compost to enhance fertility.
