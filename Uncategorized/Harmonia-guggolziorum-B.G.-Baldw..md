## Care Guide
This California native tarweed flourishes in full sun and is perfectly adapted to Mediterranean climates. It requires moderate water during its active growth period, becoming highly drought-tolerant and needing minimal to no water during summer dormancy. It thrives in lean soils, so fertilizer should be used sparingly if at all.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs. Naturally thrives in nutrient-poor, often serpentine soils; excessive fertilization should be avoided.
