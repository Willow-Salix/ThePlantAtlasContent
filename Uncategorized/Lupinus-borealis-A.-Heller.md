## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
The Boreal Lupine thrives in cool, sunny environments with well-drained soil, mimicking its montane origins. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and benefits from little to no supplemental fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils and does not require supplemental nitrogen.
