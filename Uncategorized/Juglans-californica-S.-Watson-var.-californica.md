## Care Guide
This resilient tree thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once mature, mirroring its native Mediterranean climate. Provide deep, infrequent watering during dry spells and avoid excessive fertilization. Ensure good drainage to prevent root issues.

### Fertilizer
Generally requires minimal to no fertilization once established. For very poor soils or young trees, a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial.
