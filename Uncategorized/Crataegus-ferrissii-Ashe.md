## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
Ferriss' Hawthorn thrives in temperate climates with full sun and moderate moisture. It is a hardy plant that adapts well to various soil conditions and has low to moderate fertilization needs. Provide consistent water until established, then it tolerates some drought.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; generally not a heavy feeder, but may benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring if soil is poor.
