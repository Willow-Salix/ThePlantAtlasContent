## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Longhorn Bog Orchid thrives in consistently wet, acidic conditions, mimicking its native bog and wetland habitats. It requires bright indirect to partial sun and very high humidity, with the substrate never drying out. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is preferred. If absolutely necessary, use a very dilute (1/4 strength) balanced orchid-specific fertilizer once a month during the active growing season.
