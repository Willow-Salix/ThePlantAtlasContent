## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest high elevations) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to high exposure, replicating its open alpine habitat. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity with occasional moisture from mist or rainfall, allowing for dry periods as it tolerates desiccation. |

## Introduction
Cetraria is a genus of fruticose lichens that associate with green algae as photobionts. Most species are found at high latitudes, occurring on sand or heath, and are characterised by their "strap-like" form with spiny lobe edges. The lobes can range from narrow and linear to broader and flattened, often forming loose or densely packed cushions. Their distinctive spiny margins serve both a defensive role and aid in vegetative reproduction through fragmentation. The genus was created by Erik Acharius in 1803 and belongs to the large family Parmeliaceae. While originally a species-rich genus, taxonomic revisions since the 1960s have split many species into new genera, though the exact circumscription remains debated among lichenologists.
Several Cetraria species have cultural and economic importance, particularly C. islandica (Iceland moss), which has been widely used in European traditional medicine for treating digestive and respiratory ailments. This species was also historically important as a famine food in Northern Europe and continues to find applications in modern cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Cetraria species are also ecologically important, serving as indicators of air quality and climate change due to their sensitivity to environmental conditions and ability to accumulate various elements, including potentially toxic heavy metals and radioactive isotopes.

## Care Guide
This alpine lichen thrives in full sun and requires high atmospheric humidity with occasional moisture, allowing for periods of dryness. It has very minimal nutrient needs, and traditional fertilizers are not only unnecessary but can be harmful to its growth.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low; no fertilization is required and can be detrimental to its sensitive ecosystem.
