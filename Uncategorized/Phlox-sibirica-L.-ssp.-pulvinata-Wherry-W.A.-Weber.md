## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mountains of Siberia, Mongolia, and Central Asia (e.g., Altai and Sayan Mountains) |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra / Montane Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily) due to its exposed, high-altitude native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate, well-drained soil. Water consistently during the growing season, allowing soil to dry slightly between waterings. Tolerates drought once established but dislikes prolonged wet feet, especially in dormancy, typical of rocky alpine environments. |

## Introduction
Phlox (; Ancient Greek: φλόξ "flame"; plural "phlox" or "phloxes", Ancient Greek: φλόγες phlóges) is a genus of 68 species of perennial and annual plants in the family Polemoniaceae. They are found mostly in North America (one in Siberia) in diverse habitats from alpine tundra to open woodland and prairie. Some flower in spring, others in summer and fall. Flowers may be pale blue, violet, pink, bright red, or white. Many are fragrant.

## Care Guide
This alpine phlox requires full sun and exceptionally well-drained soil to mimic its native mountainous habitat. Water moderately during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, and fertilize very sparingly. Protection from excessive winter wetness is crucial to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in lean, rocky soils. A light application of balanced granular fertilizer in early spring is sufficient, or none if soil is naturally fertile, reflecting its nutrient-poor native soil.
