## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Western United States, Western Canada, Alaska) |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Boreal Wetlands, Riparian Zones, and Moist Meadows |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, reflecting its occurrence in open or lightly shaded wet environments. |
| **Watering** | Consistently wet to moist soil, tolerating shallow standing water due to its wetland habitat. |

## Introduction
The docks and sorrels, genus Rumex, are a genus of about 200 species of annual, biennial, and perennial herbs in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae.
Members of this genus are very common perennial herbs with a native almost worldwide distribution, and introduced species growing in the few places where the genus is not native.
Some are nuisance weeds (and are sometimes called dockweed or dock weed), but some are grown for their edible leaves. Rumex species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species, and are the only host plants of Lycaena dispar and Lycaena rubidus.

## Care Guide
This wetland plant thrives in consistently wet soil and can tolerate shallow standing water, mimicking its native habitat in Western North America. It prefers full sun to partial shade and benefits from moderate fertility, typical of rich organic wetland soils. Ensure high moisture levels are maintained for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilizer, as it grows in naturally rich wetland soils, but is generally robust and not a heavy feeder.
