## Introduction
Populus balsamifera, commonly called balsam poplar, bam, bamtree, eastern balsam-poplar, hackmatack, tacamahac poplar, tacamahaca, is a tree species in the balsam poplar species group in the poplar genus, Populus. The genus name Populus is from the Latin for poplar, and the specific epithet balsamifera from Latin for "balsam-bearing".
Populus balsamifera is the northernmost North American hardwood, growing transcontinentally on boreal and montane upland and flood plain sites, and attaining its best development on flood plains. It is a hardy, fast-growing tree which is generally short lived, but some trees as old as 200 years have been found.
The tree is known for its strong, sweet fragrance, which emanates from its sticky, resinous buds. The smell has been compared to that of the balsam fir tree.

## Care Guide
This fast-growing poplar thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions, mimicking its native riparian habitat. It is quite hardy but benefits from moderate fertilization to support its rapid growth, particularly in areas with less rich soil.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, especially in less fertile soils. Rich, naturally moist soils may need less frequent application.
