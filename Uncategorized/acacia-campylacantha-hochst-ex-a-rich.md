| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread across Tropical and Subtropical Africa, including countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, South Africa, and Angola. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Savanna and Subtropical Woodland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), mimicking its open savanna habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during active growth, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established due to adaptation to distinct wet and dry seasons. |

## 🌱 Overview
Acacia, commonly known as wattles or acacias, is a genus of about 1,084 species of shrubs and trees in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the pea family Fabaceae. Initially, it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa, South America, and Australasia, but is now reserved for species mainly from Australia, with others from New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. The genus name is Neo-Latin, borrowed from Koine Greek ἀκακία (akakia), a term used in antiquity to describe a preparation extracted from Vachellia nilotica, the original type species.
Several species of Acacia have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Paperbark Thorn thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its native savanna environment. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and is highly drought-tolerant once established. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, fertilization needs are generally low.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it enriches the soil and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may be beneficial if growth is slow in poor soils.
