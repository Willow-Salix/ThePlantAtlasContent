## 🧤 Care Instructions
Native to the Mediterranean climate of South Africa, Yellow Cape Tulip thrives in full sun. It requires consistent watering during its autumn-to-spring growing season, followed by a dry period for summer dormancy. Fertilize lightly with a low-phosphorus formula during active growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, low-phosphorus fertilizer once or twice during active growth is sufficient. Avoid heavy fertilization, especially with high phosphorus.
