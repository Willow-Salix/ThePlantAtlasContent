## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern California, USA (specifically inland areas of Riverside County and adjacent regions) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean/Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring direct sunlight for most of the day in an open exposure. |
| **Watering** | Highly drought-tolerant; requires infrequent watering, primarily during germination and establishment in cooler, wetter months. Allow soil to dry completely between waterings, and reduce/cease water during its natural die-back in hot, dry summers. |

## Introduction
Chorizanthe is a genus of plants in the buckwheat family known generally as spineflowers. These are small, squat, herbaceous plants with spiny-looking inflorescences of flowers. The flowers may be in shades of red or yellow to white. The bracts are pointed and sometimes tipped with a hooked awn, and the inflorescence often dries into a rounded, spiny husk. Spineflowers are found in western North America and South America.
Name derivation: The word Chorizanthe comes from the Greek roots chorizo and anthos meaning "to divide," and "flower," thus meaning "divided flowers," but actually used in reference to the divided calyx.

## Care Guide
The Riverside Spineflower thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soils, reflecting its native arid scrubland environment. It requires infrequent watering, primarily during its growth phase in cooler months, and is very drought-tolerant, naturally completing its life cycle before intense summer heat. Fertilization is generally not necessary and can be detrimental.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer needed. Thrives in lean, well-draining, sandy or gravelly soils, typical of its native habitat.
