## Care Guide
This liverwort requires a habitat that mimics its native boreal forest floor: deep shade, consistently high humidity, and a constantly moist but well-drained substrate. Avoid direct sunlight and any chemical fertilizers. Best suited for terrariums or shaded, humid rockeries.

### Fertilizer
No fertilizer required; excessive nutrients can be harmful. Thrives on decaying organic matter in its substrate.
