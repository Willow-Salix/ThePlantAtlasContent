## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Arizona, Nevada) and Baja California, Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect; dependent on host plant, but typically found in areas with full sun exposure for the host. |
| **Watering** | Indirect; dependent on host plant, but generally tolerant of infrequent watering mimicking arid conditions once established with a host. |

## Introduction
Orobanche, commonly known as broomrape, is a genus of almost 200 species of small parasitic herbaceous plants, mostly native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere. It is the type genus of the broomrape family Orobanchaceae. It is a weed on broadleaf crop plants in Australia, where some states enforce mandatory destruction and reporting, as well as prohibition of sale.

## Care Guide
This holoparasitic plant thrives by attaching to the roots of specific host plants in arid and semi-arid environments. Its cultivation is highly dependent on establishing a compatible host and replicating the host's native conditions, as it derives all water and nutrients from the host, making direct care difficult.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; this plant is a holoparasite and obtains all nutrients from its host plant. Fertilization is irrelevant for the parasite itself.
