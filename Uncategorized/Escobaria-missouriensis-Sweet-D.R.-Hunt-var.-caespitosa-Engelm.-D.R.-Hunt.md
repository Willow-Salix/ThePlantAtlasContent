## Care Guide
This cactus thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate grasslands, requiring abundant sunlight and well-draining soil. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to fully dry out between applications, and provide very little fertilizer. Ensure it experiences a dry, cool winter dormancy.

### Fertilizer
Low. Fertilize with a diluted, low-nitrogen cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring to early summer).
