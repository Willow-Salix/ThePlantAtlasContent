## Care Guide
Wittmann's milkvetch thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established, preferring the dry summers characteristic of its native Mediterranean climate. It requires minimal watering, primarily during its cooler growing season, and needs very little to no fertilizer due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it suitable for low-maintenance, native-style gardens.

### Fertilizer
Low; As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and generally thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Minimal or no fertilizer is typically required.
