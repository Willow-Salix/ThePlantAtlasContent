## 🧤 Care Instructions
This annual thrives in conditions similar to its arid native environment. Provide full sun exposure and allow the soil to dry out completely between infrequent waterings. It has low fertilizer requirements, reflecting its adaptation to less fertile scrubland soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring should suffice, as native soils are not typically rich.
