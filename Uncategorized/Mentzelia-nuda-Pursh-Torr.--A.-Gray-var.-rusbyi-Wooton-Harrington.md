## Care Guide
This plant requires abundant sunshine and extremely well-draining soil, mimicking its arid native habitat. Provide full sun exposure and water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out thoroughly between deep waterings, and avoid rich fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
