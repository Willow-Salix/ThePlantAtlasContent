## Introduction
Setaria is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family. The name is derived from the Latin word seta, meaning "bristle" or "hair", which refers to the bristly spikelets.
The genus includes over 100 species distributed in many tropical and temperate regions around the world, and members are commonly known as foxtail or bristle grasses.

## Care Guide
This resilient grassland plant thrives in full sun conditions, typical of its native South American savannas. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and a balanced fertilizer can support growth during the active season, though it tolerates poorer soils well.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a general-purpose, balanced fertilizer can be applied once or twice during the active growing season. Thrives even in relatively poor soils.
