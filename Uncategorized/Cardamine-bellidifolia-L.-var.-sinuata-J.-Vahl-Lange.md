## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Alpine regions, including Greenland, Scandinavia, and high elevations of North America |
| **Climate** | Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. It thrives in open, bright conditions typical of alpine environments but can benefit from some afternoon shade in warmer climates to maintain cooler soil temperatures. |
| **Watering** | Keep soil consistently moist, replicating conditions found near snowmelt or in moist rocky crevices. Excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot in its naturally cold, damp environment. |

## Introduction
Cardamine is a large genus of flowering plants in the mustard family, Brassicaceae, known as bittercresses and toothworts. It contains more than 200 species of annuals and perennials. Species in this genus can be found in diverse habitats worldwide, except the Antarctic.  The name Cardamine is derived from the Greek kardaminē, water cress, from kardamon, pepper grass.

## Care Guide
To care for Alpine Bittercress, replicate its alpine tundra conditions by providing consistently moist, well-drained soil and cool, bright light. Protect it from hot, dry conditions, ensuring steady moisture throughout its growing season.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky alpine soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or organic compost annually is sufficient.
