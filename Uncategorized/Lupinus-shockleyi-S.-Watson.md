## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
Purple Desert Lupine thrives in full sun and very well-draining, lean soil, typical of its arid scrubland origin. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering, especially once established. Avoid over-fertilizing, particularly with nitrogen, to encourage healthy blooms.

### Fertilizer
Prefers lean, well-draining soil and generally does not require fertilization. As a legume, it fixes its own nitrogen; excessive nitrogen can promote foliage over flowers.
