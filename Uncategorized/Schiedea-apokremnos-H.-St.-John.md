## Care Guide
To care for Kauai Schiedea, replicate its native wet cliff habitat by providing bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Ensure high humidity and apply a dilute fertilizer during the growing season. Protect from intense, direct sunlight and waterlogging.

### Fertilizer
Apply a dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season, as native cliff environments may have moderate nutrient availability.
