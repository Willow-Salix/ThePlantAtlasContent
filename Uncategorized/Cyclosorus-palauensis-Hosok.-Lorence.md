## Introduction
Cyclosorus is a genus of ferns in the family Thelypteridaceae, subfamily Thelypteridoideae, in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Other sources sink Cyclosorus into a very broadly defined genus Thelypteris, or expand the genus to include other genera which PPG I keeps separate. Thus the online Flora of China suggests there are about 250 species compared to the two species suggested in PPG I.
There are also fossil species known from the Eocene of South China and the Quaternary of Australia.
The genus is named from the Greek, referring to the circular sori.

## Care Guide
To thrive, Cyclosorus palauensis requires a high-humidity environment with consistently moist soil and dappled, indirect light. Mimic its native tropical rainforest understory by providing regular watering and avoiding harsh direct sun.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season (spring and summer), typically once a month or every other month.
