## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | France |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Optimal flowering is achieved in full sun, reflecting its preference for open areas or forest edges in its temperate origin. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; keep soil consistently moist but well-drained, especially during the growing season. This mimics the regular rainfall patterns of temperate forests. |

## Care Guide
Lemoine's Deutzia, a hardy hybrid, thrives in temperate conditions, preferring full sun for abundant blooms. It requires consistently moist, well-drained soil to mimic temperate rainfall, and benefits from moderate fertilization. Ensure good air circulation and prune after flowering for best health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced slow-release fertilizer applied in early spring, or amending the soil with compost, is generally sufficient for the nutrient levels typical of temperate forest soils.
