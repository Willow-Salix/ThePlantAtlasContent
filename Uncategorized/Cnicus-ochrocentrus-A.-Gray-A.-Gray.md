## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (e.g., Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming) |
| **Climate** | Arid Montane Scrubland / Temperate Grassland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats in grasslands and scrublands. |
| **Watering** | Low to infrequent watering; drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking the infrequent rainfall patterns of its native arid environment. |

## Introduction
Centaurea () is a genus of over 700 species of herbaceous thistle-like flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Members of the genus are found only north of the equator, mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere; the Middle East and surrounding regions are particularly species-rich.

## Care Guide
This thistle thrives on neglect, requiring full sun exposure and very little water once established. It prefers well-draining soil and will perform best without supplemental fertilization, mirroring its adaptation to arid, nutrient-poor montane environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer needed. This plant is adapted to poor, rocky, or sandy soils typical of its native habitat and excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
