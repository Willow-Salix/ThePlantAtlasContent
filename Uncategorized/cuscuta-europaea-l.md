## 🧤 Care Instructions
Greater dodder is an obligate parasitic plant that derives all its water, nutrients, and carbohydrates directly from a host plant, to which it attaches via haustoria. It does not require soil fertilization or direct watering, as its needs are entirely met by the health and vitality of its chosen host. Therefore, cultivating this plant primarily involves providing a suitable and thriving host.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No direct fertilizer requirements for the plant itself, as it is an obligate parasite deriving all nutrients from its host.
