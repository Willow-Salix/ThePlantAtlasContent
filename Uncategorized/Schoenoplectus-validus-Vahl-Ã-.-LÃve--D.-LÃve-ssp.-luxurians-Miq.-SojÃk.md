## Introduction
Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family known by the common names grey club-rush, softstem bulrush, and great bulrush. It has a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring in every country in Europe except for Iceland, all of temperate Asia except for Mongolia, every state in the United States (including Hawaii), every province and territory in Canada except Nunavut, and in most of Australasia; only in Africa and South America is it less widespread, though still present in several countries in each. It grows in wet habitats, usually in shallow water; it is most abundant in brackish and tidal estuarine water, but also occurs widely in fresh water.
Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani is quite variable in appearance, thus explaining the long list of synonyms that have been created over the years. It is a perennial herb producing dense stands of many narrow erect stems reaching 1–1.5 m (3–5 ft), rarely to 3 m (10 ft), in height. It grows from a long rhizome system. The leaves are mostly basal, usually underwater, and have wide sheaths around the stems. The inflorescence is a panicle of spikelets on thin stems 2–6 cm long which spread, arch, or droop. The spikelets variably brown. There is usually a long, stiff bract alongside each spikelet or cluster of spikelets. Flowering is in early to mid summer (June to July in Britain), and fruiting in late summer to early autumn (August to September in Britain).
It is closely related to Schoenoplectus lacustris (common club-rush), being distinguished from it by its smaller size (up to 1.5 m, as opposed to 3 m), slenderer, glaucous stems, and in the flowers having just two, rather than three, stigmas. Both share stems circular in cross-section, unlike the triangular stems of Schoenoplectus triqueter (triangular club-rush).

## Care Guide
This wetland plant thrives in consistently wet to saturated soil, ideally with full sun exposure. Ensure a constant water supply, mimicking its natural marshy habitat, and provide moderate fertilization during its growing season for robust health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season; benefits from nutrient-rich, organic soil amendments.
