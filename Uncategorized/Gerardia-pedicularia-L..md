## Care Guide
Fern-leaf False Foxglove, a hemiparasitic plant native to temperate North American woodlands and prairies, thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering, tolerating dry periods once established, and generally needs little to no supplemental fertilizer due to its reliance on host plants.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a hemiparasitic plant, it derives a portion of its water and nutrients from the roots of nearby host plants, making supplemental fertilization largely unnecessary and potentially detrimental.
