| **Native Origin** | North America (primarily Eastern U.S. and Canada), Europe |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Filtered light to partial shade; prefers consistent indirect light, mimicking its habitat on tree bark within forests. |
| **Watering** | Maintain consistent moisture in the substrate and high ambient humidity. Requires frequent misting or regular watering to prevent drying out, but avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Desmatodon is an extinct genus of diadectid reptiliomorph. With fossils found from the Kasimovian (Missourian) stage of the Late Carboniferous of Pennsylvania, Colorado, and New Mexico in the United States, Desmatodon is the oldest known diadectid, the group of the first known herbivorous tetrapods. Later members obtained larger sizes, with Desmatodon being somewhat smaller, though its actual size is unknown due to the fragmentary nature of the fossils. Two species are currently recognized: the type species D. hollandi and the species D. hesperis.

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate forest habitat: consistent moisture, high humidity, and filtered light. Avoid direct, intense sun and waterlogging, as its nutrient needs are minimal.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low. Fertilization is generally not necessary. If used, apply a very weak, diluted liquid fertilizer sparingly once or twice during the growing season.
