## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (e.g., New Mexico, Arizona, Texas) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. Avoid prolonged exposure to intense, scorching midday sun, especially without adequate moisture. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, thorough rehydration (e.g., misting or soaking) followed by complete drying out. Rehydrate when conditions are suitable for growth; periods of dormancy when dry are natural. |

## Introduction
Verrucaria is a genus of lichenized (lichen-forming) fungi in the family Verrucariaceae. These lichens form crust-like growths on rocks, particularly limestone and other calcareous surfaces, though some species also grow on siliceous rock or occasionally on bark and soil. The genus includes both terrestrial species found in dry environments and marine species that can survive periodic flooding or permanent submersion in coastal and freshwater habitats. With about 150 accepted species worldwide, Verrucaria represents a challenging taxonomic group due to overlapping physical characteristics and the polyphyletic nature of the genus.

## Care Guide
The New Mexican wart lichen thrives in bright, indirect light to partial sun, simulating its native arid rockland environment. It requires infrequent but thorough rehydration, allowing for complete drying cycles, and should never be fertilized with traditional chemical products. Maintaining periods of moisture followed by dryness is key to its health.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Nutrients are absorbed from air and water. Chemical fertilizers are detrimental.
