# Layne's Monkeyflower

*Eunanus layneae Greene* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (specifically Sierra Nevada foothills and inner North Coast Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate / Dry-Summer Sub-humid |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during its summer dormancy period. Needs more water during its active growing season in late winter/spring. |

## Care Guide
Layne's Monkeyflower thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native dry-summer Mediterranean habitat. Water sparingly once established, especially during summer dormancy, and avoid over-fertilization to maintain its natural vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant is adapted to poor, rocky soils and excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
