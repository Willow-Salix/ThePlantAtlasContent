## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern United States (e.g., Florida, Texas), Mexico, Central America, Caribbean, and northern South America |
| **Climate** | Subtropical and Tropical Open Woodlands, Forest Margins, and Disturbed Areas |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight but can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil during the growing season, indicative of native regions with distinct wet seasons. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Can tolerate brief periods of drought. |

## Introduction
Desmodium is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice. There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. Species are distributed widely – from Quebec to northern Argentina in the Americas, across northern and southern tropical Africa, in the southern Arabian Peninsula, in Myanmar and Thailand, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in warm, humid conditions mimicking its native subtropical and tropical habitats. Provide full sun to partial shade and ensure consistent moisture during its active growth, allowing for good drainage. Moderate fertilization will support healthy growth, especially during warmer months.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. A balanced, all-purpose liquid fertilizer applied every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season is sufficient. As a legume, it may fix nitrogen, reducing its need for high nitrogen fertilizers.
