## Introduction
Salix herbacea, the dwarf willow, least willow or snowbed willow, is a species of tiny creeping willow (family Salicaceae) adapted to survive in harsh arctic and subarctic environments.  Distributed widely in alpine and arctic environments around the North Atlantic Ocean, it is one of the smallest woody plants.

## Care Guide
Dwarf Willow thrives in open, sunny locations with well-drained soil, adapting well to sandy or rocky conditions. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and is generally drought-tolerant once established. Mimicking its native temperate prairie and woodland habitat, it typically needs minimal fertilization for healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization, generally not critical. A balanced slow-release fertilizer can be applied in spring if growth is poor.
