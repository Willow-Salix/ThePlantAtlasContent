## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Puerto Rico |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright, indirect light; ideally dappled shade or filtered light, avoiding direct harsh sun. |
| **Watering** | Maintain high humidity and keep the central 'cup' or 'tank' of the plant filled with fresh, clean water. Roots should be watered lightly if planted in a medium, allowing it to dry slightly between waterings to prevent rot. |

## Introduction
Vriesea is a genus of flowering plants in the botanical family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Tillandsioideae. The genus is named after the Dutch botanist and physician Willem Hendrik de Vriese (1806–1862). Its species are widespread over Mexico, Central America, South America and the West Indies.
The genus includes many "tank bromeliads", which store water in a reservoir (a "tank") formed by their tightly overlapping leaf bases. Containing some of the largest bromeliad species, these tropical plants hold a wide variety of insect fauna. In the wild, some frog species go through their whole life cycle in these bromeliad tanks. This genus is closely related to Guzmania. Both Guzmania and Vriesea have dry capsules that split open to release parachute like seeds similar to dandelions (Taraxacum sp.). Most Vriesea are epiphytes and grow on trees. Their roots function mainly as holdfasts with a more minor role in nutrient uptake. Nutrients are predominantly absorbed from the reservoirs made by the rosette of leaves.

## Care Guide
Vriesea sintenisii, a tropical epiphyte, flourishes in high humidity and bright, indirect light conditions. Its primary water source is its central cup, which should always be kept full, supplemented by occasional light feeding during active growth.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize sparingly with a very diluted liquid fertilizer (1/4 strength) applied to the water in the cup or as a foliar spray during the growing season (spring/summer).
