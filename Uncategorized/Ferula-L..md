## Introduction
Ferula (from Latin ferula 'rod') is a genus of about 220 species of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, native to the Mediterranean region east to central Asia, mostly growing in arid climates. Many plants of this genus, especially F. communis, are referred to as "giant fennel", although they are not fennel in the strict sense.

## Care Guide
Ferula species are robust plants that thrive in full sun and well-draining, even poor soils, mimicking their native dry, open habitats. They are highly drought-tolerant and require minimal watering once established, making them ideal for arid garden settings.

### Fertilizer
Low feeder; thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, with a balanced, slow-release formula in early spring.
