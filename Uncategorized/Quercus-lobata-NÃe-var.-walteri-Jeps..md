## Introduction
Quercus lobata, commonly called the valley oak or roble, is the largest of the California oaks. It is endemic to the state, growing in interior valleys and foothills from Siskiyou to San Diego counties. Deciduous, it requires year-round groundwater, and may live up to 600 years. Its thick, ridged bark (resembling alligator hide) and deeply lobed leaves are characteristic, and assist in identification.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant tree thrives in full sun and Mediterranean climates. Once established, it requires minimal summer watering and generally no fertilization, mimicking its natural habitat where it relies on winter rains and endures dry summers.

### Fertilizer
Generally does not require fertilizer once established, as it is adapted to native soil nutrient levels. Avoid over-fertilization.
