## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant grass thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils, making it suitable for coastal or dry garden landscapes. It requires infrequent watering and has very low fertilizer needs, adapting well to challenging environments.

### Fertilizer
Very low fertilizer needs, as it naturally thrives in poor, sandy, and nutrient-deficient coastal soils. Over-fertilization should be avoided.
