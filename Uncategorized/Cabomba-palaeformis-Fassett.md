## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | South America (Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical to Tropical Freshwater Aquatic |
| **☀️ Light** | Moderate to high indirect light, mimicking its native habitat in shallow, open freshwater bodies. In an aquarium setting, bright, consistent illumination is preferred. |
| **💧 Water** | As an aquatic plant, it requires constant submersion in clean, stable freshwater. Regular water changes are crucial for maintaining water quality and dissolved oxygen levels, rather than traditional watering. |

## 🌱 Overview
Cabomba is a genus of perennial, rhizomatous, aquatic herbs in the family Cabombaceae native to tropical and subtropical America. It has divided submerged leaves in the shape of a fan (hence the vernacular name fanwort) and is much favoured by aquarists as an ornamental and oxygenating plant for fish tanks. One species, Cabomba caroliniana, is a nationally declared weed in Australia, where it has choked up waterways after escaping from aquaria.

It needs constant submersion in clean, stable water, with regular water changes for optimal health. Consistent nutrient supplementation, both in the substrate and water column, will promote vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from a nutrient-rich substrate and regular liquid fertilization in the water column to support its rapid growth and delicate foliage.
