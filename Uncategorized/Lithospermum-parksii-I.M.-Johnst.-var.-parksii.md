## Care Guide
Parks' Stoneseed thrives in full sun to partial shade with excellent drainage, mimicking its native dry, open habitats in Texas. Water moderately, letting the soil dry out between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization, as it is adapted to lean soils and drought-tolerant once established.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is needed; it is adapted to lean, well-drained soils. Avoid rich or heavily fertilized conditions.
