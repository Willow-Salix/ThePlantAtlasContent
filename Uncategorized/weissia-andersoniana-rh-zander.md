## 🧤 Care Instructions
This moss requires consistent moisture and high humidity, mimicking its native shaded and moist rock habitats. It thrives in low to moderate indirect light and has very low nutrient needs, making regular fertilization unnecessary. Focus on maintaining a damp, but not waterlogged, environment with good air circulation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer required; if absolutely necessary, use a highly diluted, balanced solution very infrequently.
