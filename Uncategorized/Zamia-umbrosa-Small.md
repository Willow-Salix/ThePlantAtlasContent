## Introduction
Zamia is a genus of cycad of the family Zamiaceae, native to North America from the United States (in Georgia and Florida) throughout the West Indies, Central America, and South America as far south as Bolivia. The genus is considered to be the most ecologically and morphologically diverse of the cycads, and is estimated to have originated about 68.3 million years ago.

## Care Guide
To mimic its native forest floor environment, this cycad requires consistent moisture and low to partial shade, avoiding direct sun. Maintain high humidity and fertilize moderately during active growth for optimal health and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Moderate feeding with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer during the growing season (spring through summer). Ensure a formula rich in micronutrients suitable for cycads.
