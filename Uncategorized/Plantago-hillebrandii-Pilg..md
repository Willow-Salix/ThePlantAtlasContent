## Introduction
Plantago is a genus of about 200 species of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae, commonly called plantains or fleaworts. The common name plantain is shared with the unrelated cooking plantain. Most are herbaceous plants, though a few are subshrubs growing to 60 centimetres (24 inches) tall.

## Care Guide
Hillebrand's Plantain thrives in full to partial sun, reflecting its native Hawaiian coastal and dry forest environments. It requires moderate watering with periods of dryness between sessions, and benefits from infrequent, diluted fertilization. Ensure well-drained soil to prevent root rot.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Use a balanced, diluted fertilizer sparingly during the active growing season, as it's adapted to naturally occurring soil nutrient levels.
