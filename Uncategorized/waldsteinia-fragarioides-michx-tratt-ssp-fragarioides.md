## 🧤 Care Instructions
This woodland native thrives in partial to full shade with consistently moist, organically rich, well-drained soil. Protect it from intense afternoon sun and ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, to mimic its natural temperate forest environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, organic soil. Light fertilization with a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or an annual application of compost in spring is sufficient. Avoid over-fertilizing.
