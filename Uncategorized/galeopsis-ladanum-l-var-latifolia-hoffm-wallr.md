## 🧤 Care Instructions
This adaptable plant thrives in full sun with well-drained soil, mimicking its native open, disturbed habitats in temperate regions. Water moderately, letting the soil dry between sessions, and use fertilizer sparingly as it tolerates average soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs; it's often found in disturbed or cultivated ground, suggesting it can adapt to average soil fertility rather than requiring rich, constantly fed soil.
