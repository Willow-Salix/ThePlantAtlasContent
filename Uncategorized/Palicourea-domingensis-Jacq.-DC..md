## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caribbean (e.g., Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Lesser Antilles) and parts of Central and South America. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest / Tropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full shade, avoiding direct intense sunlight. Thrives in the understory of dense canopies. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent and frequent watering to keep the soil evenly moist, but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Palicourea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It contains 694 species, which range from shrubs to small trees, and is distributed throughout the New World tropics.
These plants are closely related to Psychotria and in particular its subgenus Heteropsychotria. Indeed, it seems to be nothing else but a distinctively-flowered offshoot of Heteropsychotria; arguably, it would thus need to be merged into Psychotria to make that genus monophyletic. On the other hand, Psychotria is extremely diverse already, so it is probably more practical to move the more distantly related species out of this genus and merge Heteropsychotria with Palicourea. By a Hungarian botanist Attila Borhidi, some of the Psychotria species have been transferred into this genus.
The genus is not well studied. Most species are distylous, although a few on isolated Caribbean islands seem to have lost the trait.  Flowers are in racemes, having no scent, and are normally pollinated by hummingbirds.  Blue-black berries follow, and are thought to be distributed by birds.
Almost one-tenth of the Palicourea species are considered threatened by the IUCN, even though the conservation status has only been reviewed for those species that occur in Ecuador.

## Care Guide
This tropical understory plant thrives in partial to full shade with consistently moist, well-draining soil, mimicking its native rainforest environment. Provide high humidity and regular, but not excessive, watering, supplemented with a diluted fertilizer during active growth to ensure healthy foliage.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer applied monthly during the active growing season (spring and summer) to support lush growth in nutrient-rich but fast-draining forest soils.
