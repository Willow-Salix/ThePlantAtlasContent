| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Scandinavia, British Isles, Greenland, Alaska, and mountainous areas of Europe and North America. |
| **Climate** | Arctic-Alpine Tundra and Montane regions |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to full sun. While found in exposed areas, it prefers cooler temperatures and can be scorched by intense sun combined with heat. |
| **Watering** | Keep consistently moist, but not waterlogged. High humidity is crucial, requiring frequent misting or a humid environment to thrive. |

## Care Guide
Gymnomitrion concinnatum thrives in cool, consistently moist environments with high humidity and bright indirect to full sun. It requires minimal nutrients and should be watered frequently to prevent desiccation, mimicking its natural habitat on exposed, acid rocks in arctic and alpine regions.

### Fertilizer
Very low to none. Bryophytes are adapted to nutrient-poor substrates like acid rocks; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
