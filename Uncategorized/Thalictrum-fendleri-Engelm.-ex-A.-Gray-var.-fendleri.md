## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Southwestern USA: Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California; extending into Northern Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Meadow/Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Sun to Dappled Shade; tolerates more sun in cooler climates or at higher elevations, but prefers afternoon shade in warmer regions. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist, but well-drained soil, mimicking its native habitat along streambanks and in moist meadows. Regular watering is essential, especially during dry periods. |

## Introduction
Thalictrum ( ) is a genus of 120-200 species of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae, native mostly to temperate regions. Meadow-rue is a common name for plants in this genus.
Thalictrum is a taxonomically difficult genus with poorly understood species boundaries; it is in need of further taxonomic and field research for clarification.
Despite their common name of "meadow-rue", Thalictrum species are not closely related to the true rue (family Rutaceae), but resemble its members in having compound leaves twice or thrice divided.

## Care Guide
Fendler's Meadow-rue thrives in conditions mimicking its cool, moist montane origins. Provide partial sun to dappled shade, ensuring the soil remains consistently moist and well-drained. Enrich the soil with organic matter and fertilize sparingly in spring to promote lush foliage and delicate blooms.

### Fertilizer
Moderate to low; prefers organically rich soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release organic fertilizer or compost in spring will support healthy growth.
