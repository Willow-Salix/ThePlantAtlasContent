## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and shaded conditions, mimicking its native montane and subarctic habitats. Ensure good drainage while maintaining high humidity and a perpetually damp substrate. Fertilization is typically unnecessary, as it has very low nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
Very low; rarely requires fertilization, as it thrives on minimal nutrients from its substrate
