## Introduction
Lewisia is a plant genus, named for the American explorer Meriwether Lewis (1774-1809) who encountered the species in 1806. The native habitat of Lewisia species is rocky ground and cliffs in western North America. Native Americans ate the roots, which have also been used to treat sore throats.

## Care Guide
Cantelow's Lewisia requires a position in full sun to partial shade with exceptionally well-drained, lean soil, mimicking its native rocky alpine habitat. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry out between applications, and avoid overwatering, particularly in winter, to prevent rot. Fertilization is generally unnecessary due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor conditions.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer; thrives in lean, nutrient-poor, rocky soils.
