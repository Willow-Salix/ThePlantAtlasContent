## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America, primarily widespread across Canada, Alaska, and the mountainous regions of the Western United States. |
| **Climate** | Alpine/Subalpine Meadows and Open Boreal Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers high light exposure typical of open meadows or forest edges. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, ensuring well-drained soil. It's adapted to consistent moisture during the growing season from snowmelt or rain, but does not tolerate waterlogging. Tolerant of drier conditions once established. |

## Introduction
Oxytropis is a genus of plants in the legume family. It includes over 600 species native to subarctic to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. It is one of three genera of plants known as locoweeds, and are notorious for being toxic to grazing animals. The other locoweed genus is the closely related Astragalus. Most oxtropis species are native to Eurasia and North America, but several species are native to the Arctic. These are hairy perennial plants which produce raceme inflorescences of pink, purple, white, or yellow flowers which are generally pea-like but have distinctive sharply beaked keels. The stems are leafless, the leaves being all basal. The plant produces legume pods containing the seeds.

## Care Guide
Nodding Locoweed thrives in conditions mimicking its native alpine and boreal environments, requiring full sun and well-drained, lean soils. Provide moderate, consistent moisture during its active growth, but be careful to avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. Due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities, little to no supplemental fertilizer is needed.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen and thrives in lean, rocky, or nutrient-poor soils characteristic of its native habitats.
