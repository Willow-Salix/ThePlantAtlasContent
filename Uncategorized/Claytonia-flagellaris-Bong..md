## Care Guide
This ephemeral plant thrives with ample moisture and bright light during its spring growth phase, ideally mimicking snowmelt conditions. It enters dormancy in summer, requiring drier conditions. Avoid heavy fertilization, as native soils are not excessively rich.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization, if any, during its active growth period. Native soils are typically moderately fertile with organic matter, not overly rich.
