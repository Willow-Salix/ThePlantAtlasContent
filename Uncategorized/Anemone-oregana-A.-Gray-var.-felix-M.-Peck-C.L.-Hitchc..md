## Introduction
Anemone () is a genus of flowering plants in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae. Plants of the genus are commonly called windflowers. They are native to the temperate and subtropical regions of all regions except Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica. The genus is closely related to several other genera including Anemonoides, Anemonastrum,  Hepatica, and Pulsatilla. Some botanists include these genera within Anemone.

## Care Guide
This bog anemone thrives in consistently moist to wet, acidic soils, mirroring its native wetland habitats in Western Oregon. It prefers partial shade, though it can tolerate more sun in cooler, moist conditions, and requires minimal to no fertilization. Ensure constant soil moisture to mimic its natural bog environment and prevent stress.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in nutrient-poor to moderately rich, acidic soils. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, to avoid nutrient burn.
