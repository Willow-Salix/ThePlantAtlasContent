## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Arctic and Subarctic North America, including Alaska, Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, northern Quebec), and Greenland. |
| **Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun exposure, replicating the open, treeless environment of the arctic tundra. Tolerates cool, bright conditions. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, especially during its growing season, mimicking the saturated conditions often found in the thawing active layer of tundra. Avoid drought conditions. |

## Introduction
Poa is a genus of about 570 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. Poa (πόα) is Greek for 'fodder'. Poa are members of the subfamily Pooideae of the family Poaceae.
Bluegrass, which has green leaves, derives its name from the seed heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters).
The genus Poa includes both annual and perennial species. Most are monoecious, but a few are dioecious (separate male and female plants). The leaves are narrow, folded or flat, sometimes bristled, and with the basal sheath flattened or sometimes thickened, with a blunt or hooded apex and membranaceous ligule.

## Care Guide
Arctic Bluegrass thrives in cool, consistently moist, and brightly lit conditions, characteristic of its native arctic tundra. It requires full sun exposure and well-drained, but continuously damp soil, with minimal need for supplemental nutrients. Mimic its cold, exposed, and often wet native habitat for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Tundra soils are typically nutrient-poor due to slow decomposition; therefore, excessive fertilization is unnecessary and could be detrimental. A very light, balanced fertilizer might be applied sparingly if growth is exceptionally poor.
