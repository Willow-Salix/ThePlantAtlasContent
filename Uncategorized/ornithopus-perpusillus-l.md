## 🧤 Care Instructions
This hardy annual prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained, acidic soils, reflective of its native heathland and grassland habitats. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal fertilization, making it a low-maintenance choice for lean conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen. Avoid high nitrogen fertilizers; a light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer once in spring is sufficient if the soil is particularly poor.
