## Introduction
Epimedium, also known as barrenwort, bishop's hat, fairy wings, horny goat weed, or yin yang huo (Chinese: 淫羊藿; pinyin: Yínyánghùo; Wade–Giles: Yin²-yang²-huo⁴), is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae. The majority of the species are endemic to China, with smaller numbers elsewhere in Asia and a few in the Mediterranean region.
Epimedium species are deciduous or evergreen hardy perennials. The majority have four-parted "spider-like" flowers in spring.
The species used as a dietary supplement is Epimedium grandiflorum. It contains icariin, which is a weak PDE5 inhibitor, in vitro. Its clinical effects are unknown. While there is little clinical evidence to date, as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil–sold under the brand names Viagra, Levitra and Cialis–are all based on (stronger) PDE5 inhibitory action, it is thought to have erectogenic properties and is found in some men's sexual health supplements.

## Care Guide
This woodland perennial thrives in cool, shady conditions with consistently moist, well-drained, and organically rich soil. Protect it from intense afternoon sun and provide regular watering during its active growth period, along with an annual organic feeding to support its vigorous habit.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from an annual application of balanced organic fertilizer or a layer of compost in early spring to mimic the nutrient-rich forest floor.
