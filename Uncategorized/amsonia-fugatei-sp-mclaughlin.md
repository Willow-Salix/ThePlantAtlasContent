## 🧤 Care Instructions
San Antonio Bluestar prefers a location with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. It's an easy-care plant, requiring consistent moisture during establishment but becoming very drought-tolerant afterward. Fertilization is rarely needed for this resilient native perennial.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. As a prairie/woodland edge plant, it adapts to average to poor soils. A light, balanced fertilizer in early spring is optional and generally not critical.
