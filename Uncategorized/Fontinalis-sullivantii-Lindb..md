## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America (eastern United States and Canada) and Pacific Northwest (western United States and Canada). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Freshwater Aquatic (found submerged in cool, flowing streams and rivers within temperate and boreal forest biomes). |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. As an aquatic moss often found under a canopy or in moving water, it prefers dappled or filtered light and should be protected from harsh, direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Continuously submerged in cool, clean, oxygenated, and preferably moving water. Regular water changes are crucial to maintain water quality and prevent stagnation. |

## Introduction
Fontinalis is a genus of submerged aquatic mosses belonging to the subclass Bryidae. These mosses are also called willow moss, fountain moss, brook moss and water moss. The genus is widespread in the Northern Hemisphere and includes both species that occur in still water and in flowing water.

## Care Guide
Sullivant's Fontinalis Moss requires a stable aquatic environment, thriving when continuously submerged in cool, clean, and oxygenated water, ideally with some gentle flow. It prefers low to moderate indirect light and should not be fertilized, as excess nutrients can promote algae and degrade water quality.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer required. Mosses have minimal nutrient needs, and excess nutrients can lead to undesirable algae growth in an aquatic environment. Focus on good water quality over fertilization.
