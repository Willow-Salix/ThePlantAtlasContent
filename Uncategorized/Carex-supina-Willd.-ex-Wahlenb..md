## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
This sedge thrives in cool, dry, and open conditions typical of its arctic and subarctic native range. Provide full to partial sun and ensure well-drained soil with infrequent watering. Fertilization should be kept to a minimum as it prefers lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low. Thrives in nutrient-poor to lean soils.
