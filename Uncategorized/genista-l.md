# Broom
### *Genista L.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Europe, North Africa, and the Canary Islands, particularly the Mediterranean basin. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Scrubland |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in full sun exposure, mimicking its natural habitat in open, exposed areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Drought-tolerant once established. Requires moderate watering during its first year to establish roots, then infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
A broom , also known as a broomstick, is a cleaning tool, consisting of usually stiff fibers (often made of materials such as plastic, glued hair, or corn husks) attached to, and roughly parallel to, a cylindrical handle, the broomstick. It is thus a variety of brush with a long handle. It is commonly used in combination with a dustpan.
A distinction is made between a "hard broom" and a "soft broom" and a spectrum in between. Soft brooms are used in some cultures chiefly for sweeping walls of cobwebs and spiders, like a "feather duster", while hard brooms are for rougher tasks like sweeping dirt off sidewalks or concrete floors, or even smoothing and texturing wet concrete. The majority of brooms are somewhere in between, suitable for sweeping the floors of homes and businesses, soft enough to be flexible and to move even light dust, but stiff enough to achieve a firm sweeping action.
The broom is also a symbolic object associated with witchcraft and ceremonial magic.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Broom thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its Mediterranean scrubland origins. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering. Fertilization should be minimal, as these plants are adapted to lean soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally low fertilization needs. A light, balanced fertilizer can be applied in spring if soil is poor, but over-fertilization should be avoided, especially with nitrogen given its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.
