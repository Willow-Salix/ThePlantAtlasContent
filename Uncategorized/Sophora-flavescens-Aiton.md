## 🌱 Overview
Sophora is a genus of about 45 species of small trees and shrubs in the pea family Fabaceae. The species have a pantropical distribution. The generic name is derived from sophera, an Arabic name for a pea-flowered tree.
The genus formerly had a broader interpretation including many other species now treated in other genera, notably Styphnolobium (pagoda tree genus), which differs in lacking nitrogen fixing bacteria (rhizobia) on the roots, and Dermatophyllum (the mescalbeans). Styphnolobium has galactomannans as seed polysaccharide reserve, in contrast Sophora contains arabinogalactans, and Dermatophyllum amylose.
The New Zealand Sophora species are known as kowhai.
The seeds of species such as Sophora affinis and Sophora chrysophylla are reported to be poisonous.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Shrubby Sophora thrives in temperate zones, requiring full to partial sun and moderate watering with periods of dryness between sessions. Its nitrogen-fixing ability means it needs minimal fertilization, particularly avoiding excessive nitrogen. Ensure well-drained soil to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization in early spring. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, it does not require high nitrogen levels; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be used sparingly.
