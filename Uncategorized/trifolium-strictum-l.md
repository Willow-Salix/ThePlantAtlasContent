# Strict Clover
### *Trifolium strictum L.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Mediterranean region of Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Temperate climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters). |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sun daily) is optimal for robust growth, though it can tolerate light partial shade, especially in hotter climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil during its active growing season (typically cooler, wetter periods). It exhibits moderate drought tolerance during the dry summer months characteristic of its native habitat, but extended dry spells without supplemental water will stress the plant. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clovers, also called trefoils, are plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin  tres 'three' and  folium 'leaf'), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. 
They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm (12 in) tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely, they have more or fewer than three leaflets; the more (or fewer) leaflets the leaf has, the rarer it is; see four-leaf clover), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).
As legumes, clovers fix nitrogen using symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules, and are used as an alternative or supplement to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. They are also valuable food source for grazing livestock and bees. The domestication of clover caused substantial increases in agricultural productivity.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Strict Clover thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mirroring its Mediterranean native climate. It requires moderate watering during its active growth phases, tolerating some summer drought. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it has very low fertilizer needs, making it a relatively self-sufficient plant.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
As a nitrogen-fixing legume, Trifolium strictum has very low nitrogen fertilizer requirements. Excessive nitrogen can hinder its natural nitrogen-fixing ability. In very poor soils, a balanced fertilizer low in nitrogen, or one focusing on phosphorus and potassium, might be beneficial, but generally, minimal to no fertilization is needed.
