## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and North America |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Woodlands |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial sun to partial shade, typically found in well-lit but not directly exposed situations on tree bark or rocks. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies on ambient humidity, rain, and dew for moisture; requires regular wetting and drying cycles, not constant saturation. Avoid prolonged drought. |

## 🌱 Overview
Bacidia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. These lichens are characterised by their crustose growth form, distinctive club-shaped reproductive structures called apothecia that contain long, needle-like spores, and their symbiotic partnership with green algae. Bacidia species typically grow on various substrates including tree bark, rock surfaces, and occasionally soil, and are distinguished from related genera by their specific spore characteristics and internal structures.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bacidia fusca is a crustose lichen thriving in temperate woodlands. It requires partial sun to partial shade and humid conditions, absorbing moisture from rain and dew. No fertilizer is needed, as it gathers nutrients from the atmosphere.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable. Lichens absorb nutrients from atmospheric deposition (dust, gases) and rainwater; traditional fertilizers are harmful.
