## Care Guide
To mimic its native temperate forest habitat, Spotted Geranium thrives in partial to full shade with consistently moist, organic-rich soil. Ensure good drainage and provide regular watering, especially during dry spells, with minimal fertilization to support its natural growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in rich, organic soil. An annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient.
