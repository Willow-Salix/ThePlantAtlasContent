## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (primarily Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical - characterized by wet prairies, moist pinelands, and bogs with high rainfall. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, tolerating some afternoon shade, especially in hotter regions, mimicking its open habitat. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist to wet soil, never allowing it to dry out completely. Benefits from regular watering, especially during dry spells, reflecting its native boggy and wet prairie environments. |

## Introduction
Sisyrinchium is a large genus of annual to perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. Native to the New World, the species are known as blue-eyed grasses. Although they are not true grasses (Poaceae), they are monocots.
Several species in the eastern United States are threatened or endangered. This may be due to niche species emerging from their unique tendency toward rapid speciation which helps them adapt to specialized arenic (sandy) habitats.

## Care Guide
To care for Bigroot Blue-Eyed Grass, provide full to partial sun and maintain consistently moist to wet soil conditions, replicating its native bog and wet prairie habitats. Fertilize sparingly with a light, balanced feed in spring, avoiding heavy applications.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in moderately fertile to poor, often acidic soils. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer application in early spring is usually sufficient, as heavy feeding is not typically needed.
