## Introduction
Echinocactus is a genus of cacti in the subfamily Cactoideae. The generic name derives from the Ancient Greek ἐχῖνος (echînos), meaning "spiny," and cactus.  It and Ferocactus are the two genera of barrel cactus.  Members of the genus usually have heavy spination and relatively small flowers.  The fruits are copiously woolly, and this is one major distinction between Echinocactus and Ferocactus.  Propagation is by seed.

## Care Guide
This desert cactus thrives in intense full sun and requires very infrequent watering, allowing its soil to dry completely between sessions. It needs well-draining soil and benefits from minimal fertilization during its growing season. Protect from cold temperatures.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilization; use a diluted cactus fertilizer once or twice during the active growing season (spring/summer).
