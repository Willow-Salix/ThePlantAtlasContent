## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern USA (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas) and Northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland and Desert (e.g., Chihuahuan Desert, Sonoran Desert) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, mimicking its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water deeply but infrequently, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially during hot, dry periods. |

## Introduction
Mimosa is a genus of about 600 species of herbs and shrubs, in the mimosoid clade of the legume family Fabaceae. Species are native to the Americas, from North Dakota to northern Argentina, and to eastern Africa (Tanzania, Mozambique, and Madagascar) as well as the Indian subcontinent and Indochina. The generic name is derived from the Greek word μῖμος (mimos), 'actor' or 'mime', and the feminine suffix -osa, 'resembling', suggesting its 'sensitive leaves' which seem to 'mimic conscious life'.
Two species in the genus are especially notable. One is Mimosa pudica, commonly known as touch-me-not, which folds its leaves when touched or exposed to heat. It is native to southern Central and South America but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value, both as a houseplant in temperate areas, and outdoors in the tropics. Outdoor cultivation has led to weedy invasion in some areas, notably Hawaii. The other is Mimosa tenuiflora, which is best known for its use in shamanic ayahuasca brews due to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine found in its root bark.

## Care Guide
Catclaw mimosa thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its origins in arid scrublands and deserts. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, needing infrequent, deep watering, and requires minimal fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Mimicking these conditions ensures healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so excessive fertilization is unnecessary. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none if grown in reasonably fertile soil.
