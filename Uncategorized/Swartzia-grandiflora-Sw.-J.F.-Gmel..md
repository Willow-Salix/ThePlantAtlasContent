## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical South America, including countries like Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Venezuela. |
| **Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial sun. In its native habitat, it can be found in the understory receiving filtered light, or growing into secondary forests where it may receive more direct sun. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture. Keep the soil constantly moist but not waterlogged, mimicking the high rainfall of its native habitat. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly between waterings. |

## Introduction
Swartzia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It was named in honor of Swedish botanist Olof Swartz and contains about 200 species. Swartzia is restricted in its geographical distribution to the New World Tropics, where it occurs primarily in lowland rainforests, but also in savannas, pre-montane forests, and tropical dry forests. While it can be found throughout the wet lowlands from Mexico and the Caribbean islands to southern Brazil and Bolivia, Swartzia is most abundant and species-rich in Amazonia, where 10–20 species may co-occur at a single site. The species of Swartzia are mostly trees, ranging from small understory treelets to large canopy emergents. Some species, especially in savannas, are mult-stemmed shrubs.

## Care Guide
This tropical rainforest tree requires warm, humid conditions with bright indirect to partial sun. Maintain consistent soil moisture, ensuring good drainage, and provide regular fertilization during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Regular feeding during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer, as rainforest soils often have rapid nutrient cycling.
