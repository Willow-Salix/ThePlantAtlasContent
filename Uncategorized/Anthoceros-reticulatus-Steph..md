| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical Asia (e.g., India, Nepal, parts of Southeast Asia) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light; prefers dappled shade or deep shade, avoiding direct harsh sun which can scorch its delicate thallus. |
| **Watering** | High humidity and consistently moist substrate are critical; requires frequent misting or placement in a terrarium/paludarium, ensuring the substrate never dries out but is not waterlogged. |

## Care Guide
Anthoceros reticulatus thrives in high humidity and consistently moist conditions, replicating its native tropical forest floor environment. Provide low to moderate indirect light and protect it from direct sun. Fertilization should be minimal, if at all, given its low nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
Very low; bryophytes obtain most nutrients from air and water. If fertilization is deemed necessary, use an extremely diluted (e.g., 1/8 to 1/4 strength) balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly.
