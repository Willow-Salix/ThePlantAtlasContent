| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coasts of the North Pacific Ocean, including western North America (from Alaska to Baja California) and eastern Asia (Japan, Korea, Russian Far East). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Marine Coastal (specifically, shallow subtidal and intertidal zones of rocky coastlines with strong wave action). |
| **☀️ Light** | High light, requiring full direct sunlight penetration through water, as it typically grows in shallow, clear coastal waters. |
| **💧 Water** | Constant submersion in well-circulated, oxygenated, cool to temperate ocean saltwater. |

## 🌱 Overview
Phyllospadix, commonly known as surfgrass, is a genus of seagrass, a flowering plant in the family Zosteraceae, described as a genus in 1840. Phyllospadix grows in marine waters along the coasts of the temperate North Pacific.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Phyllospadix is a marine plant requiring constant submersion in cool to temperate, highly oxygenated saltwater, typically found in high-energy coastal environments. It needs ample direct sunlight for photosynthesis and draws nutrients from its marine surroundings and substrate.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives on nutrients dissolved in seawater and from marine sediment, indicating a need for a consistent supply of marine-specific dissolved nutrients.
