## Introduction
A birch is a thin-leaved deciduous hardwood tree of the genus Betula (), in the family Betulaceae, which also includes alders, hazels, and hornbeams. It is closely related to the beech-oak family Fagaceae. The genus Betula contains 30 to 60 known taxa of which 11 are on the IUCN 2011 Red List of Threatened Species. They are typically short-lived pioneer species and are widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in northern areas of temperate climates and in boreal climates. Birch wood is used for a wide range of purposes.

## Care Guide
This cold-hardy shrub thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently moist to wet, acidic soil, mimicking its native bog and subalpine environments. Fertilization should be light, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions and does not tolerate drought.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization, especially if grown in nutrient-poor or boggy soil. Prefers acidic conditions.
