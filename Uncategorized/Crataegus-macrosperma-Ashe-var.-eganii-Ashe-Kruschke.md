## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern and Central North America |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade (at least 4-6 hours of direct sun daily) to replicate its exposure in forest edges and clearings. |
| **Watering** | Moderate and consistent; water regularly during dry periods, especially when young. Established plants are tolerant of some drought due to the variable rainfall patterns of its native climate. |

## Introduction
Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, Mayflower or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.

## Care Guide
This Hawthorn thrives in full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native habitat in open woodlands and forest edges of Eastern and Central North America. It requires moderate, consistent watering, especially during establishment, and prefers well-draining, moderately fertile soil. Established plants are relatively low-maintenance, tolerating some drought and average soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from well-draining, moderately fertile soil rich in organic matter, reflecting the decomposition of leaf litter in its native habitat. An annual application of balanced fertilizer or compost in spring can be beneficial.
