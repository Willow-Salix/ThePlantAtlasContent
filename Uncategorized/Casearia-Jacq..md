## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions including Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forests |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full sun, preferring partial shade or dappled light when young or in hotter climates, typical for understory or forest edge species. |
| **Watering** | Consistent moisture is key. Water regularly, keeping the soil moist but not waterlogged, allowing the top inch to dry out slightly between waterings. Reduce frequency in cooler, dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Casearia is a plant genus in the family Salicaceae. The genus was included in the Flacourtiaceae under the Cronquist system of angiosperm classification, and earlier in the Samydaceae.
They are sometimes employed as honey plants, notably C. decandra and C. sylvestris. The latter species is occasionally used as food by the caterpillars of the two-barred flasher (Astraptes fulgerator). Several species are becoming rare due to deforestation. Some appear close to extinction, and C. quinduensis of Colombia and C. tinifolia from Mauritius seem to be extinct since some time in the 20th century and about 1976, respectively.

## Care Guide
Casearia thrives in warm, humid environments with consistently moist, well-draining soil and prefers partial shade, especially from intense afternoon sun. Provide regular watering and moderate feeding during its active growth period to mimic its native tropical and subtropical forest habitats.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer monthly during the growing season (spring through summer). Less frequent feeding, or none, in fall and winter.
