## 🌱 Overview
Dryas octopetala, the mountain avens, eightpetal mountain-avens, white dryas or white dryad, is an Arctic–alpine flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is a small prostrate evergreen subshrub forming large colonies. The specific epithet octopetala derives from Greek octo 'eight' and petalon 'petal', referring to the eight petals of the flower, an unusual number in the Rosaceae, where five is the normal number. However, flowers with up to 16 petals also occur naturally.
As a floral emblem, it is the official territorial flower of the Northwest Territories and the national flower of Iceland.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its native alpine tundra. Provide full sun and well-drained, lean soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between waterings, and use fertilizer sparingly if at all.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Naturally grows in lean, rocky, nutrient-poor soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
