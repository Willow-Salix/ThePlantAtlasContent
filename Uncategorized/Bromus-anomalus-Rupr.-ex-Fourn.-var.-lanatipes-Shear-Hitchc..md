## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western United States (e.g., California, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grasslands and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Sun to Full Sun (prefers several hours of direct sun daily) |
| **Watering** | Moderate, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Tolerates periods of drought once established, but benefits from consistent moisture during active growth. |

## Introduction
Bromus is a large genus of grasses, classified in its own tribe Bromeae. They are commonly known as bromes, brome grasses, cheat grasses, or chess grasses. Estimates in the scientific literature of the number of species have ranged from 100 to 400, but plant taxonomists currently recognize around 160–170 species.
Bromus is part of the cool-season grass lineage (subfamily Pooideae), which includes about 3300 species.  Within Pooideae, Bromus is classified in tribe Bromeae (it is the only genus in the tribe).  Bromus is closely related to the wheat-grass lineage (tribe Triticeae) that includes such economically important genera as Triticum (wheat), Hordeum (barley) and Secale (rye).

## Care Guide
Nodding Brome thrives in partial to full sun and prefers moderate watering, tolerating some drought once established. It is adaptable to various soil types and generally requires low to moderate fertilization. Mimic its native temperate grassland and open woodland environment for best results.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate. Generally not a heavy feeder; a light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may benefit growth in very poor soils, but often unnecessary.
