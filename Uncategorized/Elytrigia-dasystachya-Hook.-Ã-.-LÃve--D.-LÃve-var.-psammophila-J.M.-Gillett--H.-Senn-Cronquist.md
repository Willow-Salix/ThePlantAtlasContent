## Care Guide
Thickspike Wheatgrass is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining, sandy soils. It requires minimal watering once established and generally needs little to no fertilizer, making it an excellent low-maintenance choice for dry, sunny landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed; it thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. A light application of balanced fertilizer once a year in spring, if desired, is sufficient.
