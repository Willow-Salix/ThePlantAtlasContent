## Care Guide
Astragalus incanus thrives in full sun and well-draining, dry soil, mimicking its native European dry grasslands and rocky hillsides. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established, preferring its soil to dry out between waterings. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and adaptation to lean, calcareous soils.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities as a legume and its native habitat in lean, rocky soils, excessive fertilization should be avoided. A very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly if growth is poor.
