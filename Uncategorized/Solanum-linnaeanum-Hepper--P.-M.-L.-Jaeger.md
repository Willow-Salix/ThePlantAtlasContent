## Care Guide
This South African native flourishes in full sun and well-draining soil, thriving in conditions similar to its native subtropical grasslands. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and fertilize sparingly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly once or twice during the active growing season, as it often grows in average to disturbed soils.
