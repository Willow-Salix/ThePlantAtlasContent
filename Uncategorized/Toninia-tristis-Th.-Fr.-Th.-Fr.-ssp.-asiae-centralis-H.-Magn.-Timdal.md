## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central Asia (e.g., Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan) |
| **Climate** | Arid to Semi-arid Continental (Steppe, Alpine Foothills) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to high indirect light, as it typically grows on exposed rocks or soil in open landscapes. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent watering; highly tolerant of drought. Primarily relies on atmospheric moisture, dew, or sporadic rainfall, with long periods of desiccation common. |

## Introduction
Toninia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. The genus contains about 70 recognised species that are distributed worldwide, with many found in arctic and alpine environments as well as arid regions. These lichens are characterised by their often reduced or scale-like thalli and distinctive black apothecia (fruiting bodies) that typically become convex with age and contain needle-shaped ascospores. Toninia species primarily grow on soil, rocks, and other mineral substrates, and are distinguished from related genera by their spore-producing structures and chemical reactions to standard lichen identification tests.

## Care Guide
This Central Asian lichen thrives in dry, sunny, and exposed environments, typically on calcareous substrates. It requires minimal to no direct watering, relying instead on atmospheric humidity and occasional moisture. Conventional fertilization is unnecessary, as the lichen extracts nutrients from its immediate environment.

### Fertilizer
Not applicable; lichens absorb necessary nutrients from the air and substrate surface. No conventional fertilization is needed.
