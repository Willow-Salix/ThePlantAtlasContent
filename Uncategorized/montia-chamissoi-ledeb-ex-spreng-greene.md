| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Alaska to California, eastward to Montana and Wyoming) and Eastern Asia (Kamchatka, Sakhalin, Japan) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Wetlands and Riparian Zones |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to full sun, with a preference for dappled light or protection from intense afternoon sun, especially in warmer climates, provided soil remains consistently wet. |
| **💧 Water** | Soil must be kept consistently moist to wet at all times, mimicking its natural habitat along streambanks and seeps. Avoid any periods of dryness. |

## 🌱 Overview
Montia is a genus of plants in the family Montiaceae. Species in this genus are known generally as miner's lettuce or water chickweed. All of the species in the genus have edible leaves. It is found worldwide, except in Asia.
Montias are known from fossilized seeds recovered from sediments of the Pleistocene Tomales Formation and from a small paleoflora at San Bruno. Further, Daniel Axelrod discussed Montia howellii as one of the biogeographically significant species comprising the Millerton paleoflora at Tomales.
The genus name of Montia is in honour of Giuseppe Monti (1682–1760), an Italian chemist and botanist. It was first described and published in Sp. Pl. on page 87 in 1753.
Montia perfoliata, now Claytonia perfoliata, the species for which the term miner's lettuce was coined, is distributed throughout the Mountain West of North America in moist soils and prefers areas which have been recently disturbed. The species got its name due to its use as a fresh salad green by miners in the 1849 California Gold Rush.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Water Minerslettuce thrives in consistently saturated or wet soil, replicating its native wetland conditions. It prefers partial shade but can tolerate full sun if its moisture needs are met. Provide low to moderate fertilization to support its vigorous, yet delicate, growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season, but rich soil is not strictly necessary for healthy growth.
