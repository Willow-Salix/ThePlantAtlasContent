## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rough Cocklebur is a resilient plant thriving in full sun and consistently moist soil, typical of its native disturbed and riparian habitats in North America. It requires minimal fertilization due to its weedy nature, making it a low-maintenance species in appropriate conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied annually if soil nutrients are very poor, but generally not a high-demand plant.
