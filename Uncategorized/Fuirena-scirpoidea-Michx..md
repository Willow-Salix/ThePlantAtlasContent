## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Wetland |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in bright direct sun but can tolerate partial shade, especially in hotter climates, mimicking its open wetland habitat. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to saturated soil, mimicking its natural boggy habitat; never allow the soil to dry out, and can tolerate standing water. |

## Introduction
Fuirena, called umbrella sedges or umbrella grasses, are a genus of flowering plants in the sedge family (Cyperaceae), with a worldwide distribution, chiefly in the tropics and temperate zones. They are named for Danish physician and early botanist Georg Fuiren (Jorgen Furenius), 1581–1628.

## Care Guide
This wetland sedge, native to the southeastern US, requires consistently saturated soil and enjoys bright direct to partial sun exposure. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor bog environments, it benefits from very minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization needed; if grown in very poor soils, a dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season is sufficient, as it's adapted to nutrient-poor environments.
