## 🧤 Care Instructions
This fleabane thrives in full sun and well-drained, low-nutrient soils, mirroring its native serpentine habitats in California. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring moderate watering only during its active growing period and very little during the hot summer dormancy.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertility needs. Avoid heavy fertilization; a very light, balanced fertilizer can be applied in spring, but it is often not necessary, especially in suitable low-nutrient soil mixes.
