## Introduction
Pyrenopsis is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Porocyphaceae. The lichens grow on constantly wet, shaded rock faces where they form gelatinous crusts that soften and show reddish tints when moistened. They reproduce through small, buried fruiting bodies that open as pore-like structures at the surface.

## Care Guide
This calcicolous lichen thrives in bright, open environments found in temperate to boreal rocky habitats. It requires infrequent but thorough rehydration, followed by dry periods, and obtains nutrients from its environment without supplemental fertilization.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens absorb nutrients from the air and substrate, not requiring traditional fertilization.
