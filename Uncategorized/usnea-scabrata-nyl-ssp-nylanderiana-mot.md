# Beard Lichen
### *Usnea scabrata Nyl. ssp. nylanderiana Mot.*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Pacific Northwest of North America (e.g., coastal British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Alaska) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Rainforest / Boreal Forest |
| **☀️ Light** | Indirect bright light to partial shade. Avoid direct, intense sunlight, which can cause desiccation. |
| **💧 Water** | High atmospheric humidity is crucial, as lichens absorb moisture directly from rain, dew, and atmospheric vapor. Requires frequent misting or placement in a very humid environment; does not have roots or take up water from soil. |

## 🌱 Overview
Usnea is a genus of fruticose lichens in the large family Parmeliaceae. The genus, which currently contains roughly 130 species, was established by Michel Adanson in 1763. Species in the genus grow like leafless mini-shrubs or tassels anchored on bark or twigs. Members of the genus are commonly called old man's beard, beard lichen, or beard moss. Usnea lichens are characterized by their shrubby growth form, elastic branches with a central cord, and distinctive soralia that produce vegetative propagules. They vary in colour from pale green to yellow-green, grey-green, reddish, or variegated, and range in size from a few millimetres in polluted areas to over three metres long in species like Usnea longissima.
Members of the genus are similar to those of the genus Alectoria. A distinguishing test is that the branches of Usnea are somewhat elastic, but the branches of Alectoria snap cleanly off. Usnea species are widely distributed across temperate and tropical regions worldwide, growing primarily on trees but occasionally on rocks, and are sensitive bioindicators of air quality, thriving only in unpolluted environments. The genus has a complex taxonomic history, with many species historically over-described due to environmental variations, though modern approaches using chemical, morphological, and molecular analyses have helped clarify relationships. Usnea lichens have been used traditionally for medicinal purposes, textile dyes, fire starters, and occasionally as emergency food, and serve important ecological roles including providing nesting material for birds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This epiphytic lichen thrives in cool, highly humid environments with indirect light, mimicking its native temperate rainforest conditions. Ensure high atmospheric moisture through frequent misting and avoid direct sunlight and any soil-based fertilizers.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer needed. Lichens obtain nutrients from atmospheric deposition and dissolved minerals in rainwater; they are sensitive to excessive nutrient loads often found in standard plant fertilizers.
