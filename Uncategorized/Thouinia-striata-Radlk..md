## Care Guide
Ceboruquillo, a Caribbean native, thrives in full to partial sun, mimicking its dry forest habitat. It requires minimal watering, preferring the soil to dry out between periods, and is quite drought tolerant. Fertilize lightly during the growing season to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization during the growing season (spring/summer), especially in poor or rocky soils typical of its natural range.
