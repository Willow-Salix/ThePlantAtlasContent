*Donnellia floridana Austin* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Florida, USA |
| **Climate** | Subtropical Wetland/Forest Understory |
| **Sunlight** | Low to indirect light. Thrives in deep shade to partial shade, avoiding direct sun which can scorch its delicate foliage. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist soil, never allowing it to dry out. High humidity is crucial; misting or a pebble tray is beneficial to mimic its native wetland habitat. Avoid waterlogging, but keep perpetually damp. |

## Care Guide
Florida Spikemoss thrives in high humidity and consistently moist, well-draining soil, never allowed to dry out. It requires low to indirect light, mimicking its native shaded understory habitat. Fertilize sparingly during warmer months for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Minimal fertilization is needed. A diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied monthly during the growing season (spring/summer) at half strength, or less often.
