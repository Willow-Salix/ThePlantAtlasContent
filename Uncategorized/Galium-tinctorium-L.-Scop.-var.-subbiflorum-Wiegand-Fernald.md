## Introduction
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## Care Guide
Stiff Marsh Bedstraw thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions, mimicking its native wetland habitat. It prefers full sun to partial shade and does not require heavy fertilization, benefiting from occasional feeding during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization during the growing season; generally not a heavy feeder.
