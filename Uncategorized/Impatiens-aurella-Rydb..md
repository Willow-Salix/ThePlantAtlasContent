## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Wet Habitat |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to full sun; prefers filtered light or morning sun, especially in warmer climates, but can tolerate full sun in its naturally cooler, high-altitude, and consistently moist native environment. |
| **Watering** | High. Requires consistently moist soil, similar to its native wet places in montane zones. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely. |

## Introduction
Impatiens  is a genus of more than 1,000 species of flowering plants, widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and the tropics. Together with the genus Hydrocera (one species), Impatiens make up the family Balsaminaceae.
Common names in North America include impatiens, jewelweed, touch-me-not, snapweed and patience. As a rule-of-thumb, "jewelweed" is used exclusively for Nearctic species, and balsam is usually applied to tropical species. In the British Isles by far the most common names are impatiens and busy lizzie, especially for the many varieties, hybrids and cultivars involving Impatiens walleriana. "Busy lizzie" is also found in the American literature. Impatiens glandulifera is commonly called policeman's helmet in the UK, where it is an introduced species.

## Care Guide
This Impatiens requires consistently moist soil, mimicking its native wet montane habitat. It thrives in partial shade to filtered light, tolerating full sun only in cooler, high-altitude settings with abundant moisture. Provide regular watering and moderate fertilization during active growth to ensure vigor.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. Benefits from a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer applied monthly during the active growing season.
