## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (Canada, Alaska, northern contiguous USA, particularly in Rocky Mountains and Great Lakes regions) |
| **Climate** | Boreal Forest / Subalpine Tundra / Alpine Tundra |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in open, exposed locations characteristic of its native subalpine and alpine habitats. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist to wet soil. This plant naturally occurs in bogs, wet meadows, and along stream banks, indicating a high need for water and poor drought tolerance. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
The Bilberry Willow requires consistently moist to wet soil and prefers full to partial sun. Native to cold, northern climates, it is a hardy plant that does not tolerate drought and thrives with ample water. Fertilization is generally minimal, focusing on consistent moisture and adequate light.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Adapted to nutrient-poor to moderately rich soils. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient if soil is poor or vigorous growth is desired.
