## Care Guide
Reflexed Rockcress is a low-maintenance plant preferring full to partial sun and excellent drainage. It is drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, thriving in lean, rocky or sandy soils without the need for frequent fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Thrives in lean, well-draining soils characteristic of its native habitat; rich soil or over-fertilization can be detrimental.
