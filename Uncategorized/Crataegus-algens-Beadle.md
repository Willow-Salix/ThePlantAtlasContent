## 🧤 Care Instructions
This Hawthorn flourishes in temperate climates, ideally in full sun with consistent, well-drained moisture. It is quite adaptable to various soil types and generally requires minimal fertilization. Once established, it becomes a relatively low-maintenance and drought-tolerant shrub or small tree.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally not a heavy feeder. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied in early spring if soil is poor or to promote vigorous growth, but often thrives with organic matter amendment.
