## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | North America (widespread in Eastern, Central, and Southern USA, parts of Canada and Mexico), also reported in parts of Central and South America, Europe, and Asia. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Forest (specifically riparian zones, often on wet, calcareous rocks, or submerged in shallow water) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to medium indirect light; it thrives in shaded or partially shaded environments. Direct sunlight should be avoided as it can cause desiccation. |
| **Watering** | High and consistent moisture; this moss needs to be kept constantly damp or even partially submerged in water. High ambient humidity is crucial, mimicking its natural habitat along stream banks and wet rocks. |

## Care Guide
This moss requires a consistently moist, high-humidity environment with low to medium indirect light. Mimic its natural habitat by keeping it damp or submerged and ensuring it avoids direct sun. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its low nutrient demands.

### Fertilizer
Very low; mosses generally have minimal nutrient needs. If fertilization is deemed necessary, use a highly diluted (e.g., 1/4 strength) liquid fertilizer very infrequently.
