## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, particularly the Southwestern United States (e.g., Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming) and parts of northern Mexico. |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland to Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun; requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to thrive, replicating its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Very drought-tolerant once established. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Infrequent deep watering is preferred over frequent shallow watering. |

## Introduction
Haplopappus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae found in South America, mostly restricted to the dry regions of the Southern Andes, Chilean Matorral, and Patagonia.

## Care Guide
This resilient plant thrives in full sun and very well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid and desert environments. It is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal watering once established, and generally has low fertilizer needs. Provide conditions that emulate its dry, sunny, and open native habitat for optimal growth.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in lean soils and typically does not require fertilization in average garden conditions. If growth is poor, a light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring may be applied.
