## Introduction
Hedyotis (starviolet) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. Many species of this genus such as Hedyotis biflora, H. corymbosa and H. diffusa are well known medicinal plants. Hedyotis is native to tropical and subtropical Asia and to islands of the northwest Pacific. It comprises about 115 species. The type species for the genus is Hedyotis fruticosa.
Hedyotis was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in Species Plantarum. This generic name is derived from two Greek words, hedys, "sweet", and otos, "ear", in reference to the sweet-scented, ear-shaped leaves of some species.

## Care Guide
Hale's Bluet thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. It tolerates a range of soil types and benefits from regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization is generally minimal, reflecting its adaptability to less fertile native environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season, especially if grown in lean soils.
