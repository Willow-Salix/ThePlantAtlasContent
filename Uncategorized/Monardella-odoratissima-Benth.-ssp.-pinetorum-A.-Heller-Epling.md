## Introduction
Monardella is a genus of approximately 40 species of annual and perennial plants native to western North America from British Columbia to northwestern Mexico. They are grown for their highly aromatic foliage, which in some species is used for herbal teas. The two-lipped, tubular flowers are formed in terminal clusters and are most usually red, pink, or purple.
Monardella is a Latin diminutive form of Monarda (a taxonomic patronym honoring the Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes), which the form of the flower heads resembles.  Plants in this genus are commonly known as wildmints, coyote mints or monardellas.

## Care Guide
Pine Monardella thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil, mirroring its native dry pine forests and chaparral. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering. Minimal to no fertilizer is necessary due to its adaptation to lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer is needed, as it naturally grows in lean, well-drained soils characteristic of pine forests and chaparral.
