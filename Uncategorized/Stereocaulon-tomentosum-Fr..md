## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar boreal and alpine regions, including North America (Alaska, Canada, northern USA), Northern Europe (Scandinavia, Arctic regions), and Northern Asia (Siberia, Arctic regions). |
| **Climate** | Alpine and Arctic Tundra, often found in open, exposed rocky areas or thin soil over rocks. |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, typical of exposed alpine or arctic environments where it is not shaded by other vegetation. |
| **Watering** | Regular moisture from precipitation or atmospheric humidity (like snowmelt, rain, dew), allowing for periods of complete drying, as lichens absorb water directly from their environment. |

## Introduction
Stereocaulon is a genus of lichens. Members of Stereocaulon are commonly called rock foam lichens. Photobiont partners of Stereocaulon include green algae from the genera Asterochloris, Chloroidium, and Vulcanochloris. Stereocaulon is difficult to ID to species, but there is a high diversity of species within the genus.

## Care Guide
This cold-adapted lichen thrives in cool to cold environments with high light exposure when not covered by snow. It requires regular rehydration from ambient moisture but can tolerate dry periods. Fertilizers must be strictly avoided, as they are toxic to lichens.

### Fertilizer
None; artificial fertilizers are detrimental and can kill the lichen, as it obtains its minimal nutrient requirements directly from the atmosphere and the substrate it grows on.
