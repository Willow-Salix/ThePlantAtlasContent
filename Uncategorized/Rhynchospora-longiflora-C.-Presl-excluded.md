## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, including Central and South America, Southern United States, Africa, Asia, and Australia (based on accepted synonym Rhynchospora corymbosa) |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Wetlands, Marshes, and Swamps |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun. Thrives in high light exposure as it grows in open, wet habitats. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently wet to saturated soil; can tolerate standing water. Mimic its native boggy environment by ensuring the soil never dries out. |

## Introduction
Rhynchospora (beak-rush or beak-sedge) is a genus of about 400 species of sedges with a cosmopolitan distribution. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves.  The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles.  Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.

The inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.
Members of this genus have holocentric chromosomes and have become a model for the study of chromosome evolution and meiotic recombination in holocentric plants. The genomes of Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis have been published in 2022.

## Care Guide
This wetland sedge thrives in full to partial sun with consistently wet to saturated soil, reflecting its native marsh and swamp habitats. Ensure the plant never dries out and provide low to moderate fertilization during its active growth period for best results.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a balanced liquid fertilizer sparingly during the growing season, especially if planted in nutrient-poor soils.
