## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mediterranean Basin, Macaronesia (e.g., Canary Islands, Madeira), Western Europe, North Africa |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (rocky, exposed habitats) |
| **Sunlight** | High sun exposure, as it thrives on exposed siliceous rocks in open areas with full sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent but thorough wetting, mimicking natural rainfall and dew; highly tolerant of dry periods. Does not require soil moisture, as it absorbs water directly from the air and rain. |

## Introduction
Lecanora is a genus of lichen commonly called rim lichens. Lichens in the genus Squamarina are also called rim lichens. Members of the genus have roughly circular fruiting discs (apothecia) with rims that have photosynthetic tissue similar to that of the nonfruiting part of the lichen body (thallus). Other lichens with apothecia having margins made of thallus-like tissue are called lecanorine.
It is in the  family Lecanoraceae in the suborder Lecanorineae.

## Care Guide
This crustose lichen thrives in high sun exposure on rocky substrates, typical of Mediterranean climates. It requires infrequent wetting, mimicking natural rainfall and atmospheric moisture, and can tolerate long dry periods. No traditional fertilization is necessary, as it absorbs nutrients from the air and its substrate.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients from atmospheric dust, rain, and the minerals present in their rock substrate.
