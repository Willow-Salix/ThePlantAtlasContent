## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant perennial thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its native temperate prairie and glade habitat. Water sparingly once established, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and requires minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in average to poor, well-drained soils and typically does not require regular fertilization. If desired, a light, balanced fertilizer in spring.
