# Rim Lichen
### *Squamarina cartilaginea (With.) P. James*

## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Coastal regions across temperate and Mediterranean climates globally, including Western Europe (e.g., UK, Portugal, Mediterranean countries), North America (Pacific coast), Macaronesia, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Coastal Temperate and Mediterranean (often on exposed siliceous rocks and cliffs) |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure. Thrives in direct, bright sunlight for most of the day, mimicking its natural habitat on exposed rock faces. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent watering. This lichen tolerates significant periods of desiccation. It requires cycles of thorough wetting followed by complete drying, common in coastal environments with rain and sea spray. |

## 🌱 Overview
Squamarina is a genus of lichens in the family Stereocaulaceae. They form patches of radiating lobes or overlapping scales (squamules), with a well-developed upper cortex and no lower cortex. They grow on calcareous soil and rocks.  Squamarina lentigera can be used to make a yellow dye.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To cultivate, provide high levels of direct light and excellent air circulation, mimicking its exposed coastal rock habitat. It requires a distinct wetting and drying cycle, tolerating long periods of dryness, and has virtually no nutrient requirements, relying on ambient sources.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Extremely low to none. As a saxicolous (rock-dwelling) lichen, it obtains necessary trace nutrients from the air, rain, and the rock substrate itself. Supplemental fertilizer is not needed and could be harmful.
