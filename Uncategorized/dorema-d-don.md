## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central and Western Asia, particularly Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland, Steppe, Semi-desert, characterized by hot, dry summers and often cold winters. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to mimic their open, exposed native habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Highly drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Ferula (from Latin ferula 'rod') is a genus of about 220 species of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, native to the Mediterranean region east to central Asia, mostly growing in arid climates. Many plants of this genus, especially F. communis, are referred to as "giant fennel", although they are not fennel in the strict sense.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Dorema plants thrive in full sun and well-drained conditions, mirroring their arid native climate. Water sparingly, ensuring the soil dries out thoroughly between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization to maintain their natural resilience.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal fertilizer required. These plants are adapted to lean soils, so apply a very light, balanced fertilizer sparingly, if at all, during the active growing season.
