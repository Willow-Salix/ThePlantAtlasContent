## Introduction
Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word saxifraga means literally "stone-breaker", from Latin saxum ("rock" or "stone") + frangere ("to break"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

## Care Guide
This alpine plant thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun exposure, although some afternoon shade can be beneficial in hotter regions. Maintain consistent moisture without waterlogging, especially during the growing season, and provide minimal fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light annual application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost in spring is sufficient.
