## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern United States (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah) and Northern Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert Chaparral |
| **☀️ Light** | Requires full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth and flowering, typical of its exposed native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Prefers infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between sessions; highly drought-tolerant once established due to its arid native climate. |

## 🌱 Overview
Helianthemum (), known as rock rose, sunrose, rushrose, or frostweed, is a genus of about 110 species of flowering plants in the family Cistaceae. They are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, especially in the Mediterranean.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hoary Sunrose thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, reflecting its native arid scrubland environment. It is exceptionally drought-tolerant, requiring infrequent watering, and has minimal fertilizer needs, making it ideal for xeriscaping or rock gardens.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally requires minimal to no fertilization; thrives in lean, well-drained soils. Over-fertilization can reduce flowering and promote leggy growth.
