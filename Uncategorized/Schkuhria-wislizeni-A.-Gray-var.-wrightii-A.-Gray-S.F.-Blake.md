## Introduction
Schkuhria is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Bahieae within the family Asteraceae. False threadleaf is a common name. It includes two species native to the Americas, ranging from the south-central United States to Argentina. The genus was named in honour of Christian Schkuhr (1741-1811), a German gardener and physical scientist at the University of Wittenberg.

## Care Guide
This desert-adapted plant thrives in full sun and requires infrequent, deep watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions. It needs minimal fertilization due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor, arid scrubland environments, making it a low-maintenance choice for hot, dry climates.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilizer needs; adapted to nutrient-poor soils. A light application of balanced fertilizer once a year during the growing season is sufficient, or none at all if soil is moderately fertile.
