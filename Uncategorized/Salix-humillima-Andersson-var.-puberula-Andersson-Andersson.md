## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Siberia, Russia |
| **Climate** | Boreal and Temperate Wetland Regions |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. Can tolerate partial sun, especially in warmer climates. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native riparian and boggy habitats. Avoid allowing the soil to dry out completely, particularly during active growth periods. |

## Introduction
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## Care Guide
This willow thrives in consistently moist to wet conditions with ample sunlight, reflecting its origins in Siberian wetland areas. Ensure a steady water supply and provide full to partial sun exposure for healthy growth, with moderate fertilization as needed to support its vigorous nature.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a moderate application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring, especially in less fertile soils. Generally not a heavy feeder if planted in naturally rich, damp ground.
