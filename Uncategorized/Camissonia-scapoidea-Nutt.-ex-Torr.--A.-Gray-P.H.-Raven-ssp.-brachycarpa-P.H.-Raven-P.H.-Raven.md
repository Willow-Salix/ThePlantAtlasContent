## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Great Basin region of the United States (including parts of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Oregon, Idaho) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert Biome |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, thriving in open and exposed areas with direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **Watering** | Very infrequent watering; highly drought-tolerant. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. |

## Introduction
Camissonia, sometimes commonly known as sun cup or sundrop, is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the evening primrose family Onagraceae. A total of 12 species are known, nearly all from western North America, especially in the California Floristic Province, but also one from South America. Previous circumscriptions of the genus had recognized up to 62 species before it was split among other closely related genera.
The flowers generally open at dawn and are yellow. They are usually cup-shaped, thus the common name.
Formerly included in Oenothera, the species of Camissonia are distinguished by having a club- or head-shaped stigma, instead of the 4-part-divided stigma of Oenothera or Clarkia.
Camissonia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia cupes and Schinia deserticola, both of which feed on C. claviformis, the latter exclusively.
The genus is named after the botanist Adelbert von Chamisso.

## Care Guide
Paiute Suncup thrives in full sun and dry conditions, mimicking its native arid scrubland habitat. Provide infrequent watering, allowing the soil to dry thoroughly between sessions, and avoid over-fertilization as it prefers lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Native to lean, poor, sandy, or rocky soils, it generally does not require fertilization.
