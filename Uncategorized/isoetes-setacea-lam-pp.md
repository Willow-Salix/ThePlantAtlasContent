## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Europe (including British Isles, France, Spain, Italy) and parts of North Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate, typically found in temporary freshwater pools, seasonal wetlands, and wet ditches, often experiencing distinct wet and dry periods. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Sun. As an aquatic plant in open, shallow waters, it is naturally exposed to high light levels. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent submersion in shallow fresh water (5-30 cm deep) during its active growing season (typically autumn to spring). Tolerates seasonal drying of its habitat, entering a dormant state in the substrate during dry summer months. |

## 🌱 Overview
Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of lycopod. It is the only living genus in the family Isoetaceae and order Isoetales. As of 2016, there were about 200 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution mostly in aquatic habitats but with the individual species often scarce to rare. Species virtually identical to modern quillworts have existed since the Jurassic epoch, though the timing of the origin of modern Isoetes is subject to considerable uncertainty.
The name of the genus may also be spelled Isoëtes. The diaeresis (two dots over the e) indicates that the o and the e are to be pronounced in two distinct syllables. Including this in print is optional; either spelling (Isoetes or Isoëtes) is correct.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Brittle Quillwort thrives in shallow, clear fresh water under full to partial sun during its active growth phase. It requires consistent submersion but is adapted to seasonal drying, where it enters dormancy. Nutrient needs are minimal, reflecting its natural habitat.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor (oligotrophic) to moderately fertile (mesotrophic) freshwater environments. Excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
