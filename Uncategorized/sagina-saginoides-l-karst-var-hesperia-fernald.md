## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America (Alaska to California), often at higher elevations. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Cool Temperate Wet Meadows/Alpine-Subalpine Bogs |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade, preferring some shade in warmer climates or during the hottest part of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep consistently moist to wet; does not tolerate drying out. Replicate bog-like conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Sagina (like Colobanthus called "pearlworts") is a genus of 20–30 species of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. These are flowering herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere extending south to tropical mountain areas at high altitudes, reaching just south of the equator in Africa. They are small annual or perennial herbaceous plants, growing to 5–15 cm. The leaves are opposite, often in tight whorl-like clusters, simple linear, typically 5–20 mm long. The flowers are solitary or in small cymes, with four or five green sepals and an equal number of white petals; the petal size relative to the sepal size is useful in species identification. The fruit is a small capsule containing several seeds.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Western Pearlwort thrives in consistently wet, cool conditions, mimicking its native boggy or alpine habitats. It requires constant moisture and can tolerate full sun in cooler climates but benefits from partial shade in warmer regions. Minimal fertilization is needed to support its growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization is sufficient, typically once or twice during the growing season with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer.
