| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Eastern North America, particularly the Eastern and Central United States and parts of Canada |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest and Grasslands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade (at least 6 hours of direct sun for optimal growth and fruiting), reflecting its preference for forest edges, clearings, and open fields. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering to maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during dry spells and fruiting; allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Rubus is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, subfamily Rosoideae, most commonly known as brambles. Fruits of various species are known as raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, and bristleberries. It is a diverse genus, with the estimated number of Rubus species varying from 250 to over 1000, found across all continents except Antarctica.
Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles like roses; spines, bristles, and gland-tipped hairs are also common in the genus. The Rubus fruit, sometimes called a bramble fruit, is an aggregate of drupelets. The term cane fruit or cane berry applies to any Rubus species or hybrid which is commonly grown with supports such as wires or canes, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry. The stems of such plants are also referred to as canes.

## Care Guide
The Hairyleaf Dewberry thrives in temperate conditions, requiring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It benefits from moderate fertility, achieved through organic matter and spring fertilization, to support its trailing growth and fruit production. Ensure proper air circulation to prevent fungal issues.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertility; benefits from amending the soil with organic compost and a balanced, slow-release fertilizer application in early spring to support vigorous growth and fruit production.
