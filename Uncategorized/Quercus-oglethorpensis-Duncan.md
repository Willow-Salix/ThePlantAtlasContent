## Introduction
Quercus oglethorpensis (also called Oglethorpe oak) is a species of plant in the beech family. It is endemic to the United States. It is named for Oglethorpe County, Georgia, where it was first discovered. The county, in turn, is named for James Oglethorpe, the founder of Georgia Colony in the 18th century.

## Care Guide
The Oglethorpe oak requires full sun to partial shade and consistently moist conditions, mirroring its native humid subtropical bottomland habitat. It tolerates varying soil drainage and benefits from moderate fertilization to ensure robust growth, particularly during its establishment phase.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilizer. Native soils are often rich in organic matter; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can support young trees or those in less fertile sites.
