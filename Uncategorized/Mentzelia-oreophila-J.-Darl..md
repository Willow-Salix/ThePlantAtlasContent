## Care Guide
Argus Blazingstar thrives in full sun and very well-draining, often rocky soils, reflecting its native dry mountain slopes in California. It is highly drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal watering. Fertilization is generally not needed, as it is adapted to lean conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to none; adapted to lean soils. Over-fertilization can be detrimental. If necessary, a very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring.
