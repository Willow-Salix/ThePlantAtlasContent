## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Widespread in temperate regions of Europe and North America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate regions, often found in forests or on exposed rocks and soil. |
| **☀️ Light** | Prefers partial shade but can tolerate full sun exposure if atmospheric humidity is consistently high; direct, dry, intense sun should be avoided. |
| **💧 Water** | Relies entirely on atmospheric moisture from rain, dew, and fog for hydration. Requires consistently high ambient humidity; traditional watering methods are not applicable and can be detrimental. |

## 🌱 Overview
Thrombium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Protothelenellaceae. The genus was established in 1831 by the German lichenologist Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wallroth, who originally described numerous species under this name. Thrombium species are characterized by their extremely thin, often barely visible crusty thalli and tiny black fruiting bodies embedded in the substrate. These lichens grow on soil, rocks, mosses, and plant debris in various habitats around the world. The genus has undergone significant taxonomic revision over the years, with DNA studies confirming its placement in Protothelenellaceae and clarifying that some species historically assigned to Thrombium actually belong to other genera.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Thrombium lichens flourish in temperate environments with abundant atmospheric moisture. They prefer dappled light but can endure sunnier conditions if humidity remains high. Traditional watering and fertilization are unnecessary and can be harmful, as they naturally absorb nutrients and moisture from their surroundings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require traditional fertilizers. Obtains all necessary nutrients from the air and precipitation and is highly sensitive to environmental pollutants.
