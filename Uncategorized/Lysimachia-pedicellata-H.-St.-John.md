| **Native Origin** | Hawaiian Islands (Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Maui) |
| **Climate** | Tropical Wet Forest / Subtropical Wet Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Partial Shade to Full Shade (prefers filtered light, avoids direct intense sun) |

## Introduction
Lysimachia ( LY-sim-AY-kee-ə) is a genus consisting of 182 accepted species of flowering plants traditionally classified in the family Primulaceae. Based on a molecular phylogenetic study it was transferred to the family Myrsinaceae, before this family was later merged into the Primulaceae.
