## Care Guide
The Mojave Woodyaster is a desert-adapted plant that thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, being highly drought-tolerant once established. It is accustomed to poor, rocky soils, thus needing little to no fertilizer to flourish.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils, it generally does not require fertilization. If growth seems stunted, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly once a year.
