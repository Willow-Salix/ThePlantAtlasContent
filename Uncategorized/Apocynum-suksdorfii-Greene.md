## Introduction
Apocynum, commonly known as dogbane or Indian hemp, is a small genus of the flowering plant family Apocynaceae. Its name comes from Ancient Greek ἀπόκυνον, from ἀπο- apo- "away" and κύων kyōn "dog", referring to dogbane (Cionura erecta), which was used to poison dogs. The genus is native to North America, temperate Asia, and southeastern Europe.
Apocynum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the queen butterfly and the mouse moth.
