## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western Nevada, USA (Lahontan Valley) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Great Basin Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its exposure in open desert and scrubland environments. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, deep watering; highly drought-tolerant once established. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic arid rainfall patterns and prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Lupinus, commonly known as lupin, lupine, or regionally bluebonnet, is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. The genus includes over 199 species, with centres of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centres occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants, but are invasive to some areas.

## Care Guide
This Lupine thrives in full sun and well-draining, even poor, soils, reflecting its native arid scrubland habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires infrequent watering once established, allowing the soil to dry out between applications. Minimal fertilization is needed due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities and adaptation to nutrient-scarce environments.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so supplemental nitrogen is rarely required. A light application of a balanced, low-nitrogen fertilizer or compost in spring might be beneficial only in very poor soils.
