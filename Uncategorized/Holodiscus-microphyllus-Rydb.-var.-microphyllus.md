## Care Guide
This resilient shrub thrives in sunny, dry, and rocky conditions, mimicking its native arid montane environment. It demands minimal watering and has low fertilizer requirements, making it ideal for xeriscaping or low-maintenance landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, rocky soils. A light, balanced fertilizer application in spring, if desired, is sufficient.
