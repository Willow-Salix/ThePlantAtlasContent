# Ã—Schedololium Soreng & Terrell

*Ã—Schedololium Soreng & Terrell* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, reflecting the native ranges of its parent genera (Lolium and Festuca), and areas where these genera are naturalized. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) for optimal growth, consistent with open grassland exposure. |
| **Watering** | Moderate, consistent watering. The soil should be kept moist but well-draining, allowing the top layer to dry slightly between waterings. Avoid waterlogging and prolonged drought. |

## Care Guide
This temperate grass hybrid thrives in full sun and requires moderate, consistent watering, ensuring the soil dries slightly between sessions. Provide balanced fertilization during active growth to support its robust nature, typical of temperate grassland species, and ensure well-draining soil.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from regular fertilization with a balanced granular fertilizer during its active growing season, typically spring through fall, to support vigorous growth in moderate to rich soils.
