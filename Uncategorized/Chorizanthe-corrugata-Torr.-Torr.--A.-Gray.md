## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (primarily California, particularly the Mojave Desert and adjacent arid regions) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun (requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Low; drought-tolerant. Water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, mimicking sparse desert rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Chorizanthe is a genus of plants in the buckwheat family known generally as spineflowers. These are small, squat, herbaceous plants with spiny-looking inflorescences of flowers. The flowers may be in shades of red or yellow to white. The bracts are pointed and sometimes tipped with a hooked awn, and the inflorescence often dries into a rounded, spiny husk. Spineflowers are found in western North America and South America.
Name derivation: The word Chorizanthe comes from the Greek roots chorizo and anthos meaning "to divide," and "flower," thus meaning "divided flowers," but actually used in reference to the divided calyx.

## Care Guide
This desert annual thrives in full sun and very well-draining, nutrient-poor soil, requiring minimal watering once established. Mimic its native arid climate by allowing the soil to completely dry between infrequent waterings, and avoid rich fertilizers for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Very Low to None. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor desert soils; excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
