## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically montane and subalpine regions of the Rocky Mountains (e.g., Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico). |
| **Climate** | Montane to Subalpine, characterized by moist meadows, open woodlands, and stream banks with cool temperatures and high soil moisture. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial sun to full sun, ideally with protection from intense afternoon heat, especially in warmer climates, to mimic its high-elevation habitat. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist soil; requires regular watering, particularly during dry spells, to prevent the soil from drying out completely, reflecting its native damp environments. |

## Introduction
Polemonium, commonly called Jacob's ladders or Jacob's-ladders (the name derived from the Biblical story), is a genus of between 25 and 40 species of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae, native to cool temperate to arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. One species, Polemonium micranthum, also occurs in the southern Andes in South America. Many of the species grow at high altitudes, in mountainous areas. Most of the uncertainty in the number of species relates to those in Eurasia, many of which have been synonymized with Polemonium caeruleum.
Polemonium are perennial plants (rarely annual plants) growing 10–120 cm tall with bright green leaves divided into lance-shaped leaflets. They produce blue (rarely white or pink) flowers in the spring and summer.
Some species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora polemoniella.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its cool, moist montane and subalpine native habitat. Provide consistently damp soil and partial to full sun, ensuring some afternoon shade in hotter regions. Fertilize sparingly in spring for optimal health.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization; a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer applied once in spring should suffice, as mountain soils are not typically overly rich.
