## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northeastern China, Korean Peninsula, and Russian Far East (specifically the Amur River basin). |
| **Climate** | Temperate Deciduous Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Best flowering and overall health are achieved with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, though it can tolerate some afternoon shade in hotter climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is needed, keeping the soil consistently moist but well-drained. Ensure regular moisture during establishment and prolonged dry periods, though established trees exhibit good drought tolerance. |

## Introduction
Maackia is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. There are 9 species, all native to eastern Asia, from China and Taiwan through Korea, Japan, and the Russian Far East. Six species are endemic to China. The generic name honors the botanist Richard Maack.
They are deciduous trees and shrubs. The alternately arranged leaves are divided into leaflets. The inflorescence is a simple or compound raceme of many flowers. Each flower has an inflated calyx with five teeth. The white or greenish corolla has a reflexed standard petal and keel petals that are fused at the bases. The fruit is a wide or narrow, flattened legume pod containing one to five flat seeds.

## Care Guide
The Amur Maackia flourishes in temperate deciduous forest conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it has low fertilizer requirements, primarily needing good soil structure and moderate watering to thrive.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it fixes its own nitrogen, so avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. An annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in spring is generally sufficient if soil fertility is a concern.
