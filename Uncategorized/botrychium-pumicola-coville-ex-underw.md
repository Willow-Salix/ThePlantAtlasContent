## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Specific to the Crater Lake region of Oregon, USA. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subalpine Coniferous Forest with volcanic soils (pumice). Characterized by cold, snowy winters and mild, relatively dry summers. |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to dappled sun. It grows in open, mossy areas within subalpine forests, suggesting it can tolerate some direct morning sun but should be protected from intense afternoon exposure. |
| **💧 Water** | Keep soil consistently moist but ensure excellent drainage, mimicking its native pumice slopes. Water regularly, especially during the active growing season, allowing the top layer to slightly dry out between waterings. Avoid waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Botrychium is a genus of ferns, seedless vascular plants in the family Ophioglossaceae. Botrychium species are known as moonworts. They are small, with fleshy roots, and reproduce by spores shed into the air. One part of the leaf, the trophophore, is sterile and fernlike; the other, the sporophore, is fertile and carries the clusters of sporangia or spore cases.  Some species only occasionally emerge above ground and gain most of their nourishment from an association with mycorrhizal fungi.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Crater Lake Grapefern requires cool, moist conditions with excellent drainage, similar to its native subalpine volcanic habitat. Provide dappled sunlight or partial shade and maintain consistently moist but not waterlogged soil. Fertilize very lightly during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Fertilize sparingly with a dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., once a month at half strength) during the growing season. Its native volcanic soils are not highly nutrient-rich.
