## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical (Temperate Woodlands and Grasslands) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade (prefers full sun for optimal flowering and robust growth) |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering; allow the soil to dry out between waterings. Established plants are quite drought-tolerant, reflecting their adaptation to periodically dry conditions in their native habitat. |

## Introduction
Symphyotrichum () is a genus of over 100 species and naturally occurring hybrids of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family, Asteraceae, most which were formerly treated within the genus Aster. The majority are endemic to North America, but several also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as one species in eastern Eurasia. Several species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii).

## Care Guide
The Largeflower Aster thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moderate watering, tolerating drought once established. It is well-suited to average to poor soils and requires minimal fertilization. Mimic its native open woodland and grassland environment for best results.

### Fertilizer
Low; this plant is adapted to average to poor soils and typically does not require heavy fertilization. An annual light application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be beneficial, but is often not essential.
