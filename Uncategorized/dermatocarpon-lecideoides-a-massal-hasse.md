## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Southwestern USA (e.g., Arizona, New Mexico, California), Mexico |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert (Saxicolous, growing on exposed rocks) |
| **☀️ Light** | High sun exposure; thrives on open, exposed rock surfaces with direct sunlight for most of the day. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent; relies on sporadic rainfall and atmospheric moisture (dew) for hydration. Tolerates long periods of drought, rehydrating quickly when water is available. |

## 🌱 Overview
Dermatocarpon is a genus of lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. Members of the genus are commonly called stippleback lichens because they have fruiting structures called perithecia that are flask-shaped structures embedded in the nonfruiting body (thallus), with a hole in the top to release spores, causing an appearance of being covered with small black dots. Its species are told apart chiefly by spore size, the colour and texture of the lower surface, and whether the epinecral layer gives a pruinose bloom.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for this saxicolous lichen, provide a high-light environment mimicking its native exposed rock habitats. Watering should be infrequent, simulating desert rainfall and dew. No traditional fertilization is needed, as it naturally absorbs nutrients from its surroundings.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Not applicable; as a lichen, it obtains all necessary nutrients directly from the air and the rock substrate. Supplemental fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
