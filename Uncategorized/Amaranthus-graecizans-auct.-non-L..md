## Care Guide
White Pigweed is a robust annual that thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant once established. It requires well-draining soil and minimal fertilization, often growing vigorously in disturbed or poor soil conditions, making it a low-maintenance plant.

### Fertilizer
Low; this plant typically thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils without the need for supplemental feeding. Excess fertilizer can promote leafy growth at the expense of overall plant vigor.
