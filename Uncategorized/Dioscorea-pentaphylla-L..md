| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Monsoon Forests, Open Woodlands, Forest Edges |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers partial to full sun, especially once established and climbing. Can tolerate some shade but will grow more vigorously with more light, mimicking its climb through canopy gaps. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistent, frequent watering during its active growing season, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged. Reduce watering significantly during any dormant period, reflecting its adaptation to wet and dry seasons. |

## Introduction
Dioscorea is a genus of over 600 species of flowering plants in the family Dioscoreaceae, native throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of the world. The vast majority of the species are tropical, with only a few species extending into temperate climates. It was named by the monk Charles Plumier after the ancient Greek physician and botanist Dioscorides.

## Care Guide
This tropical vine thrives in warm, humid conditions with ample light exposure. Provide consistent moisture during active growth and moderate fertilization to encourage healthy tuber development. Reduce watering significantly during any dormant phase.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from moderate fertilization, especially during the active growth phase, to support tuber development. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or regular feeding with a diluted liquid fertilizer is suitable.
