# Showy Monkeyflower

*Eunanus pulchellus E. Drew ex Greene* • **Uncategorized**

## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (specifically Sierra Nevada foothills and inner North Coast Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean (characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sun, especially in cooler regions; may appreciate afternoon shade in hottest climates) |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during its active growing season (spring), allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. It is drought tolerant once established, particularly during its summer dormancy. Ensure excellent drainage. |

## Care Guide
This California native thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-draining soil, adapted to dry summers and wet winters. Water moderately during its spring growing season and ensure excellent drainage to prevent rot. Fertilization is generally not required.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer needed. If growth appears sluggish, a very dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring.
