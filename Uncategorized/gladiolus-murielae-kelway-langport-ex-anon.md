## 🌱 Overview
Gladiolus (from Latin, the diminutive of gladius, a sword) is a genus of perennial cormous flowering plants in the iris family (Iridaceae).

It is sometimes called the 'sword lily', but is usually called by its generic name (plural gladioli).
The genus occurs in Asia, Mediterranean Europe, South Africa, and tropical Africa. The center of diversity is in the Cape Floristic Region. The genera Acidanthera, Anomalesia, Homoglossum, and Oenostachys, formerly considered distinct, are now included in Gladiolus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in sunny locations with well-draining soil, mirroring its native East African highland habitat. Provide ample water during its growing period and then allow it to dry out significantly during dormancy. Fertilize moderately to support robust growth and flowering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
A balanced granular fertilizer applied at planting and monthly during the active growing season, or a slow-release fertilizer. Avoid excessive nitrogen.
