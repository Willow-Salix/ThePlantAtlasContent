## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Central Europe (as a horticultural hybrid, its parent species are native to temperate European woodlands and subalpine meadows) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Temperate Woodland / Subalpine Meadow |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to full sun (prefers partial shade in warmer climates, tolerates full sun in cooler, moist conditions) |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is key; water regularly to keep soil moist but not waterlogged, mimicking the damp conditions of its native habitat. |

## 🌱 Overview
Aconitum (), also known as aconite, monkshood, wolfsbane, leopard's bane, devil's helmet, or blue rocket, is a genus of over 250 species of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. These herbaceous, frequently toxic perennial plants are chiefly native to the mountainous parts of the Northern Hemisphere in North America, Europe, and Asia, growing in the moisture-retentive but well-draining soils of mountain meadows.
Most Aconitum species are extremely poisonous and must be handled very carefully.  Several Aconitum hybrids, such as the Arendsii form of Aconitum carmichaelii, have won gardening awards—such as the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Some are used by florists.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Twocolor Monkshood thrives in cool, moist conditions reminiscent of temperate woodlands. Provide partial shade, especially in warmer areas, and ensure consistently moist, organically rich soil. Annual fertilization with compost or a balanced feed will support its vigorous growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Prefers rich, well-draining soil high in organic matter; a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost annually in spring is sufficient.
