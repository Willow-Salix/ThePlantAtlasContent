## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (Rocky Mountain region of the United States and Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Subalpine Grasslands and Open Woodlands |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, ideally receiving at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, especially in cooler climates. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering is required. Allow the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is tolerant of some drought once established but performs best with consistent moisture without being waterlogged. |

## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
This adaptable perennial thrives in sunny to partly shaded locations with well-drained soil, mimicking its native subalpine grasslands. Provide moderate, consistent watering, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and avoid over-fertilizing to maintain its hardiness and vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer applied once in early spring is sufficient, or none if planted in naturally rich soil, as it is adapted to leaner conditions.
