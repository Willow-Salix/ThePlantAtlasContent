## Introduction
Bryum is a genus of mosses in the family Bryaceae. It was considered the largest genus of mosses, in terms of the number of species (over 1000), until it was split into three separate genera in a 2005 publication. As of 2013, the classification of both Bryum and the family Bryaceae to which it belongs underwent significant changes based on DNA studies.

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, consistently moist, and humid environments with low to partial indirect light. Ensure the substrate remains damp but not waterlogged, and avoid direct sunlight. Fertilization is rarely necessary due to its minimal nutrient needs.

### Fertilizer
Very low nutrient requirements; supplemental fertilization is generally not needed and can be detrimental. If used, apply a highly diluted liquid fertilizer sparingly.
