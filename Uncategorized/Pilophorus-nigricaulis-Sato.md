## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light to partial sun exposure, mimicking its subalpine native habitat. Ensure high atmospheric moisture through regular misting or placement in a humid environment. No additional fertilization is required, as it naturally derives nutrients from its surroundings.

### Fertilizer
No conventional fertilizer is needed; lichens obtain essential nutrients from the air, rainfall, and their substrate surfaces.
