## 🌱 Overview
Calicium is a genus of leprose lichens. It is in the family Caliciaceae, and has 40 species.
The sexual reproduction structures are a mass of loose ascospores that are enclosed by a cup shaped exciple sitting on top of a tiny stalk, having the appearance of a dressmaker's pin (called a mazaedium), hence the common name pin lichen. They are also commonly called stubble lichens.
They have been used as indicator species for old growth redwood forests.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in humid, shaded environments, mirroring its native forest habitat in the southeastern U.S. Provide high humidity and indirect light, ensuring it receives moisture from the air rather than traditional watering or fertilizing, as it grows on bark, not in soil.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
No specific fertilizer required; lichens absorb nutrients directly from the air and substrate (tree bark).
