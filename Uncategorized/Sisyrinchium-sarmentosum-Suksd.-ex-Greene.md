## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northwestern North America (primarily Cascade Mountains of Washington and Oregon, USA) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane Meadow / Subalpine Parkland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in full sun in cooler climates, benefits from some afternoon shade in warmer regions. |
| **Watering** | Consistently moist but well-drained soil. Regular watering is essential, especially during dry periods, but avoid waterlogging. |

## Introduction
Sisyrinchium is a large genus of annual to perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. Native to the New World, the species are known as blue-eyed grasses. Although they are not true grasses (Poaceae), they are monocots.
Several species in the eastern United States are threatened or endangered. This may be due to niche species emerging from their unique tendency toward rapid speciation which helps them adapt to specialized arenic (sandy) habitats.

## Care Guide
This montane plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with consistently moist, well-drained soil. Avoid drought and waterlogging. Fertilization needs are minimal, preferring a light feeding in spring.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is sufficient, or none if grown in reasonably fertile soil.
