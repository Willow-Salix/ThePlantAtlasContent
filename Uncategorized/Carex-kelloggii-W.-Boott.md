## Introduction
Carex is a vast genus of over 2,000 species of grass-like plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (or seg, in older books). Other members of the family Cyperaceae are also called sedges; however, those of genus Carex may be called true sedges. Carex is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.

## Care Guide
Kellogg's Sedge thrives in consistently wet or moist conditions, making it perfect for water gardens or boggy areas. It prefers full sun to partial shade and benefits from rich, organic soil, though it is not a heavy feeder. Ensure continuous access to water to mimic its native wetland habitat.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. It benefits from rich, organic soil but does not require heavy fertilization. A light annual application of compost or a balanced slow-release fertilizer is generally sufficient.
