## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | High-altitude and high-latitude regions across Europe, North America, and Asia, particularly in montane and alpine stream environments. |
| **Climate** | Alpine/Montane Riparian |
| **Sunlight** | Bright indirect light to partial shade. Can tolerate some direct morning/late afternoon sun if constantly wet, but avoids intense midday sun. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant moisture; substrate must be continuously wet or submerged in clear, fresh water. Cannot tolerate drying out. |

## Introduction
Dermatocarpon is a genus of lichens in the family Verrucariaceae. Members of the genus are commonly called stippleback lichens because they have fruiting structures called perithecia that are flask-shaped structures embedded in the nonfruiting body (thallus), with a hole in the top to release spores, causing an appearance of being covered with small black dots. Its species are told apart chiefly by spore size, the colour and texture of the lower surface, and whether the epinecral layer gives a pruinose bloom.

## Care Guide
Silverskin Lichen is an aquatic species needing constant access to clear, fresh water, either submerged or kept continuously saturated. It thrives in bright indirect light to partial shade and does not require fertilization. Maintaining a consistently wet environment is paramount for its survival.

### Fertilizer
None. Lichens acquire nutrients from the air and water; artificial fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
