## 🧤 Care Instructions
Alpine Bistort thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained conditions with full to partial sun, mimicking its native alpine and arctic habitats. Provide consistent moisture during the growing season while ensuring excellent drainage, and use minimal to no fertilizer to prevent over-enrichment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Native soils are typically thin and nutrient-poor. A very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all, is usually sufficient.
