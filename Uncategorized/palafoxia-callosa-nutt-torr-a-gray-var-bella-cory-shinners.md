## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant is well-adapted to hot, dry conditions, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping. It demands full sun exposure and extremely well-drained soil, tolerating poor fertility. Water sparingly, only after the soil has thoroughly dried, as it is highly susceptible to overwatering.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Fertilization is generally not critical and a light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, or none at all, is sufficient.
