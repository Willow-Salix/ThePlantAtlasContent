## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western North America, specifically California, USA (Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada foothills). |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Dry-Summer Subtropical) in Chaparral, Oak Woodland, and Grassland biomes. |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open, well-lit environments, tolerating some afternoon shade, especially in hotter inland areas. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires moderate watering during its active growing season (winter and spring) when rainfall is naturally abundant. Drought-tolerant once established and prefers dry conditions during summer dormancy. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Clarkia is a genus within the flowering plant family Onagraceae.  Over 40 species are currently classified in Clarkia; almost all are native to western North America, though one species (Clarkia tenella) is native to South America.
Clarkias are typically annual herbs, growing either prostrate or erect to a height of less than 2 metres.  Their leaves are small and simple, from 1 to 10 cm in length depending on the species.  Their flowers have four sepals and four petals, usually white, pink, or red, and are often spotted or streaked. Their fruit are elongated, cylindrical pods, usually 4-grooved or 8-grooved, and when mature they hold many tiny, cubical seeds.
Several members of the genus are sometimes referred to by the common name "godetia", including Clarkia amoena, Clarkia affinis, and Clarkia lassenensis (the Lassen godetia).  This is because they were formerly classified in a genus called Godetia, which is no longer recognised since its members have been absorbed into the genus Clarkia.  Older sources may still use Godetia as a genus name.
The genus was named in honour of the explorer Captain William Clark. Unofficially, the genus is sometimes referred to as Yorkia, in honor of York, an African-American member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.
The Royal Navy had a warship called HMS Clarkia, a Flower-class corvette.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Whitestem Clarkia is a drought-tolerant annual best suited for full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. Water moderately during its active growth period in spring, then reduce significantly as it enters summer dormancy. Minimal fertilization is needed, reflecting its adaptation to naturally less fertile soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Generally low. These plants are adapted to naturally less fertile soils. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, or no fertilizer if soil is already moderately rich, is sufficient.
