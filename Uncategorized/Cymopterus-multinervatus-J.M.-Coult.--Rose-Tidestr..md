| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent, allow soil to dry completely between waterings; highly drought-tolerant given its arid native climate. |

## Introduction
Cymopterus is a genus of perennial plants in the family Apiaceae native to western North America. They are commonly known as the spring parsleys and are edible. They are mostly stemless, taprooted perennial herbs with leaves at ground level and flowering scapes bearing yellow, white, or purple flowers.

## Care Guide
This desert native thrives in full sun and excellent drainage, mirroring its arid scrubland habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to completely dry out between waterings, and avoid heavy fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to none; native soils are typically low in organic matter. If potted, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer once a year might suffice.
