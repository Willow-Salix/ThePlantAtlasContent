## Introduction
Lepidium is a genus of plants in the mustard/cabbage family, Brassicaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. It includes familiar species such as garden cress, maca, and dittander. General common names include peppercress, peppergrass, pepperweed, and pepperwort.  Some species form tumbleweeds.
The genus name Lepidium is from Greek meaning 'small scale', which is thought to be derived from a folk medicine usage of the plant to treat leprosy, which cause small scales on the skin. Another meaning is related to the small scale-like fruit.

## Care Guide
Mountain pepperweed thrives in full sun and dry conditions, reflecting its native arid montane habitat. It requires minimal watering, preferring the soil to dry out completely between applications, and generally does not need much fertilizer to prosper.

### Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer; native soils are typically poor to moderate in nutrients, so heavy fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
