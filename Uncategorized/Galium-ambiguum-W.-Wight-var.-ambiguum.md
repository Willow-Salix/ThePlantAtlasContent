## Introduction
Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.
Over 600 species of Galium are described, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, Sherardia arvensis, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. Asperula is also a closely related genus; some species of Galium (such as woodruff, G. odoratum) are occasionally placed therein.

## Care Guide
This drought-tolerant bedstraw prefers full sun to partial shade and requires excellent drainage. Water sparingly after establishment, focusing on supplementing natural rainfall during its active growing season. Fertilization needs are minimal, thriving in leaner soils.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils. A light, balanced fertilizer application can be given annually if soil is very poor.
