## 🧤 Care Instructions
Showy Phlox is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering. Avoid over-fertilization to prevent leggy growth and ensure abundant blooms.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs. Thrives in poor to moderately fertile, well-drained soils. A light, balanced fertilizer application in early spring, if necessary, is sufficient, but often not required.
