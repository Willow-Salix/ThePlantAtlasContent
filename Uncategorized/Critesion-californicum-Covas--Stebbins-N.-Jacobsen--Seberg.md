## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Central and Northern California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Grassland (seasonally wet) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours direct sunlight daily), as it naturally grows in open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | High water needs during its growing season (late winter to late spring), requiring consistently moist to wet soil conditions, akin to its native marshy meadows or vernal pools. It is an annual, so it will naturally dry out after setting seed. |

## Care Guide
This annual grass, California Barley, thrives in full sun and requires consistently moist to wet soil throughout its active growth period from late winter to late spring, mirroring its native seasonally wet habitats. It prefers average soil fertility and will complete its lifecycle naturally, drying out as summer progresses.

### Fertilizer
Average fertility. It thrives in moderately fertile soils; a light application of a balanced fertilizer in early spring may be beneficial if soil quality is poor, but it generally does not require heavy feeding.
