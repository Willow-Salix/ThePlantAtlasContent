## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | California, USA (specifically Central Western California, San Francisco Bay Area, and South Coast Ranges) |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Grassland/Chaparral |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native habitat in open, exposed grassy slopes. |
| **Watering** | Moderate to low; water deeply when the soil is dry to the touch during its active growing period (typically winter and spring). It is highly tolerant of drought conditions during the dry summer months. |

## Introduction
Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

## Care Guide
Cream Sacs thrive in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, characteristic of their native Californian Mediterranean grasslands. They prefer moderate watering during their active winter-to-spring growth but are highly drought-tolerant in summer. Minimal to no fertilization is required due to their adaptation to nutrient-poor soils and hemiparasitic nature.

### Fertilizer
Very low; this plant is adapted to lean, often serpentine soils and is hemiparasitic, drawing nutrients from host plants. Rich fertilization is unnecessary and potentially harmful.
