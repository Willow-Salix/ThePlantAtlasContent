## Care Guide
This hardy grass thrives in temperate climates with full sun to partial shade. It requires consistently moist soil, particularly when young, and benefits from low to moderate fertilization. Once established, it is relatively low maintenance and can tolerate some dry periods.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring, especially in poor soils, but generally not a heavy feeder.
