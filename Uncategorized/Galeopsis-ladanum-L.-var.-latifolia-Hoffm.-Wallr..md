## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Europe (widespread across temperate regions), Western Asia |
| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Disturbed Ground |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun, requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, reflecting its natural habitat in open fields and disturbed ground. |
| **Watering** | Prefers moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out significantly between waterings, consistent with its tolerance for dry conditions in its native temperate habitats. |

## Care Guide
This adaptable plant thrives in full sun with well-drained soil, mimicking its native open, disturbed habitats in temperate regions. Water moderately, letting the soil dry between sessions, and use fertilizer sparingly as it tolerates average soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilizer needs; it's often found in disturbed or cultivated ground, suggesting it can adapt to average soil fertility rather than requiring rich, constantly fed soil.
