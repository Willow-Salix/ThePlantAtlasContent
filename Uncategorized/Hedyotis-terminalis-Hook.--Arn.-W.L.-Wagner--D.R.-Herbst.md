## Introduction
Hedyotis (starviolet) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. Many species of this genus such as Hedyotis biflora, H. corymbosa and H. diffusa are well known medicinal plants. Hedyotis is native to tropical and subtropical Asia and to islands of the northwest Pacific. It comprises about 115 species. The type species for the genus is Hedyotis fruticosa.
Hedyotis was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in Species Plantarum. This generic name is derived from two Greek words, hedys, "sweet", and otos, "ear", in reference to the sweet-scented, ear-shaped leaves of some species.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions mimicking its Hawaiian wet forest origin, preferring bright indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Ensure high humidity and moderate feeding during active growth to support its lush foliage.

### Fertilizer
Moderate fertilization during the growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer, given the rich but often leached soils of its native forest.
