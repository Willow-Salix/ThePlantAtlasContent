## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Ancient Persia (modern Iran and neighboring regions) |
| **Climate** | Temperate, characterized by cool, moist growing seasons |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun in cooler climates; partial shade in warmer climates to prevent bolting and extend harvest. |
| **Watering** | Consistent and ample moisture is essential; never allow the soil to dry out completely to ensure tender leaf growth. |

## Introduction
Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is a leafy green flowering plant native to Central and Western Asia. It is of the order Caryophyllales, family Amaranthaceae, subfamily Chenopodioideae. Its leaves are a common vegetable consumed either fresh, cooked or after storage (using preservation techniques like canning, freezing, or dehydration). The taste differs considerably between cooked and raw: the high oxalate content may be reduced by steaming.
It is an annual plant (rarely biennial), growing as tall as 30 cm (1 ft). Spinach may overwinter in temperate regions. The leaves are alternate, simple, ovate to triangular, and very variable in size: 2–30 cm (1–12 in) long and 1–15 cm (1⁄2–6 in) broad, with larger leaves at the base of the plant and small leaves higher on the flowering stem. The flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green, 3–4 mm (1⁄8–5⁄32 in) in diameter, and mature into a small, hard, dry, lumpy fruit cluster 5–10 mm (1⁄4–3⁄8 in) across containing several seeds.
In 2022, world production of spinach was 33 million tonnes, with China alone accounting for 93% of the total.

## Care Guide
Spinach thrives as a cool-season crop in temperate climates, requiring consistent moisture and rich, nitrogen-rich soil for optimal leaf production. It prefers full sun in cooler conditions but should be provided partial shade in warmer temperatures to avoid premature bolting. Regular watering and feeding are crucial for a successful harvest.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from rich, well-draining soil, heavily amended with organic matter, and regular feeding with nitrogen-rich fertilizer for lush foliage.
