## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Wet-soil Lupine thrives in consistently moist to wet soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, mirroring its native Californian wet meadow and open woodland habitats. It requires regular and ample watering to prevent drying out. Being a nitrogen-fixing plant, it has minimal fertilizer needs, especially avoiding high-nitrogen formulations.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer or compost can be applied sparingly once a year if soil nutrients are poor.
