## Introduction
The genus Lindernia is a group of plants in the family Linderniaceae. They are native to warm regions in both the Eastern and Western Hemisphere.
The genus name of Lindernia is in honour of Franz Balthasar von Lindern (1682–1755), French doctor and botanist in Strasbourg and also university botanical garden director. 
Lindernia consists of 30 species in its most recent circumscription. Some species have become available commercially for use in home aquariums and aquascaping, such as L. rotundifolia.

## Care Guide
The Sparrow False Pimpernel requires consistently wet to bog-like conditions, often thriving fully submerged or semi-aquatically. Provide bright indirect to full sun and moderate fertilization during active growth to mimic its native tropical, waterlogged habitats.

### Fertilizer
Moderate; benefits from a balanced liquid fertilizer applied during the growing season, especially if grown in non-aquatic substrates.
