## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Europe, particularly Sweden and Norway, extending to other Nordic and temperate European regions. |
| **Climate** | Temperate Boreal Forest (humid understory) |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light. Prefers shaded or dappled light conditions, protected from direct, intense sunlight, mimicking its natural habitat on tree bark in forest understories. |
| **Watering** | High atmospheric humidity is crucial. Requires frequent misting or a consistently moist environment. Does not tolerate prolonged dry periods. Water absorption is primarily from airborne moisture and rainfall, not soil. |

## Care Guide
This crustose lichen thrives in cool, highly humid environments with low to moderate indirect light. It requires consistent moisture from the air and protection from direct sun and drought. Traditional fertilization should be avoided as it can be detrimental to its delicate symbiotic nature.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilization is required. Lichens absorb nutrients directly from the atmosphere and their substrate. Artificial fertilizers can be harmful.
