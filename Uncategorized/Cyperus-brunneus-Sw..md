## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Caribbean islands (e.g., Cuba, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Hispaniola), southern Florida (USA), Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Coastal/Wetland, characterized by warm temperatures, high humidity, and often high rainfall or consistent moisture from proximity to water bodies. |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial sun exposure, reflecting its natural habitat in open coastal areas and wetlands. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist to wet soil, mimicking its native wetland or riparian environment; it is not drought-tolerant and should never be allowed to dry out completely. |

## Care Guide
This tropical sedge thrives in warm, humid conditions with abundant sunlight. Keep its soil consistently moist to wet, and provide occasional light fertilization during active growth to mimic its native coastal wetland environment.

### Fertilizer
Benefits from a light application of balanced liquid fertilizer during the active growing season, as native soils can be moderately fertile but not overly rich.
