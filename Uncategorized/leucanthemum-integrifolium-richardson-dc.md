## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Arctic regions of North America (Alaska, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Greenland) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Arctic Tundra |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in bright, open exposure, adapting to continuous daylight during summer months in its native habitat. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires consistent moisture during its active growing season, but excellent drainage is crucial to prevent root rot. Tolerates somewhat moist conditions due to melting snow/permafrost, but not waterlogging. |

## 🌱 Overview
Leucanthemum is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. Species range naturally from Europe through the Caucasus, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, and Siberia to the Russian Far East. Some species are known on other continents as introduced species, and some are cultivated as ornamental plants. The name Leucanthemum derives from the Greek words λευκός – leukos ("white") and ἄνθεμον – anthemon ("flower").  Common names for Leucanthemum species usually include the name daisy (e.g. ox-eye daisy, Shasta daisy), but "daisy" can also refer to numerous other genera in the Asteraceae family.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This arctic native thrives in cool temperatures and bright light, preferring well-drained soil that remains consistently moist during its short growing season. Avoid rich soils and heavy fertilization, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer requirements. Thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky, or sandy soils characteristic of its native tundra environment.
