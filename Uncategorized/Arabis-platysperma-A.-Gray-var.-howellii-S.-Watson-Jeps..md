## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (specifically Oregon and northern California, USA) |
| **Climate** | Montane to Subalpine |
| **Sunlight** | Prefers full sun to partial sun; thrives in open, exposed environments typical of rocky slopes and open pine forests. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate, consistent moisture during active growth but is intolerant of waterlogging. Excellent drainage is essential, mimicking the well-drained conditions of its native rocky habitats. Tolerates some drier periods once established. |

## Care Guide
Howell's Pioneer Rockcress thrives in bright, open conditions with well-drained soil, replicating its montane native habitat. Provide moderate and consistent moisture, especially during active growth, but avoid overwatering to prevent root issues. Minimal fertilization is generally sufficient for this hardy species.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Being a pioneer species often found in rocky, sometimes serpentine soils, it is adapted to less fertile conditions. A light, balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring may benefit plants in very poor soils.
