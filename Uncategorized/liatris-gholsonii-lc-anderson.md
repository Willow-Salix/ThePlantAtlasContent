## 🧤 Care Instructions
Gholson's Blazing Star thrives in full sun and consistently moist, well-draining soil, reflecting its native humid subtropical pine flatwood environment. It is a low-maintenance plant that requires minimal fertilization and tolerates some drought once established, making it a robust garden choice.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
