## 🧤 Care Instructions
This annual grass prefers full sun, reflecting its native open grassland and Mediterranean habitats. It requires low to moderate watering, thriving with moisture during its active growth period and tolerating dry conditions as it matures. Minimal fertilization is sufficient, as it is adapted to less fertile soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. This species often thrives in poor or disturbed soils and does not require rich fertilization. Excessive nutrients may encourage lush growth that is more prone to lodging.
