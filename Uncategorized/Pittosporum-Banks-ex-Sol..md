## Care Guide
Cheesewood thrives in temperate to subtropical conditions, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Provide regular watering to maintain soil moisture, and a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring can encourage robust growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to Moderate; benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, particularly in poor soils. Otherwise, good organic matter in the soil is often sufficient.
