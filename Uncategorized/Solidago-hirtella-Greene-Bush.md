## Care Guide
Hairy Goldenrod is a resilient plant best suited for full to partial sun, typical of its native prairie and open woodland habitats. It requires moderate watering in well-drained soil, becoming drought-tolerant once established. This species is low-maintenance, requiring minimal to no fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer requirements. It naturally grows in average to poor soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization. Excessive nutrients can lead to leggy growth.
