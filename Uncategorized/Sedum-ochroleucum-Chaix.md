## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern and Central Europe, including countries like Italy, France, Spain, the Balkan Peninsula, and parts of Austria, often found in mountainous or rocky regions. |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Shrubland / Temperate Grassland (on dry, rocky slopes) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), reflecting its natural habitat on exposed, sunny rocky slopes. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; native to dry, rocky environments, it requires the soil to dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot. |

## Introduction
Sedum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, members of which are commonly known as stonecrops. The genus has been described as containing up to 600 species, subsequently reduced to 400–500. They are leaf succulents found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, but extending into the southern hemisphere in Africa and South America. The plants vary from annual and creeping herbs to shrubs. The plants have water-storing leaves. The flowers usually have five petals, seldom four or six. There are typically twice as many stamens as petals. Various species formerly classified as Sedum are now in the segregate genera Hylotelephium and Rhodiola.
Well-known European species of Sedum are Sedum acre, Sedum album, Sedum dasyphyllum, and Sedum hispanicum.

## Care Guide
This resilient succulent thrives in full sun and requires very well-draining soil, mimicking its native dry, rocky habitats. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and fertilize rarely, as it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; it thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and generally does not require frequent fertilization. A light feeding in spring is sufficient if desired.
