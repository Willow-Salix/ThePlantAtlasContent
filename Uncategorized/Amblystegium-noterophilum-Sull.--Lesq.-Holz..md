## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia; specifically found in calcareous spring habitats. |
| **Climate** | Temperate; microclimate of cool, oxygenated, alkaline (calcium-rich) springs and seeps, often with consistent water flow. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to moderate indirect light; avoids intense direct sunlight. |
| **Watering** | Requires constant saturation or submersion in cool, flowing, calcium-rich water; must never dry out. |

## Care Guide
This aquatic moss thrives in cool, constantly saturated to submerged conditions within calcareous, flowing water. Provide moderate indirect light and avoid letting it dry out, as specific water chemistry and consistent moisture are crucial for its survival.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low. Nutrients are typically derived from dissolved minerals in water; supplemental fertilizers are generally not needed and can be detrimental.
