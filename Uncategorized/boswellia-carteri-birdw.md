## 🌱 Overview
Boswellia sacra, also known as Boswellia carteri and others, and commonly called the frankincense tree or the olibanum tree, is a tree in the genus Boswellia, in the Burseraceae family, from which frankincense, a resinous dried sap, is harvested. The olibanum tree is a plant native to the countries of Oman and Yemen, in the south of the Arabian Peninsula, and to Somalia and Ethiopia, in the Horn of Africa. In 2012, it was replanted in Israel in the Middle East, 1,500 years after dying out there.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives on neglect, preferring full sun and well-draining soil. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings, and fertilize very sparingly, if at all. Mimicking its arid scrubland origins is key to successful cultivation.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Native to nutrient-poor, rocky soils; over-fertilization can be detrimental. Fertilize sparingly, if at all, during the growing season with a diluted, balanced fertilizer.
