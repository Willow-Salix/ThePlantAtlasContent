## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Cuba |
| **Climate** | Tropical Dry Forest and Xeric Scrubland |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun to Partial Shade. Prefers full sun for optimal growth and flowering, adapting to high light intensity typical of its native open habitats. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering during the growing season, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Drought-tolerant once established; reduce watering significantly during cooler or dormant periods. |

## Introduction
Malpighia is a genus of flowering plants in the nance family, Malpighiaceae. It contains 108 species of shrubs or small trees, all of which are native to the American tropics, ranging from Texas through Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean to Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. The generic name honours Marcello Malpighi, a 17th-century Italian physician and botanist. The species grow to 1–6 m (3.3–19.7 ft) tall, with a dense, often thorny crown. The leaves are evergreen, simple, 0.5–15 cm (0.20–5.91 in) long, with an entire or serrated margin. The flowers are solitary or in umbels of two to several together, each flower 1–2 cm (0.39–0.79 in) diameter, with five white, pink, red, or purple petals. The fruit is a red, orange, or purple drupe, containing two or three hard seeds. M. emarginata, the acerola, is cultivated for its sweet and juicy fruits, which are very rich in vitamin C.

## Care Guide
Shafer's Malpighia thrives in full sun with well-draining soil, reflecting its native tropical dry forest and scrubland environment in Cuba. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between applications, and fertilize lightly during its active growth period. This plant is drought-tolerant and relatively low-maintenance once established.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or a diluted liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Less is often more for plants adapted to leaner soils.
