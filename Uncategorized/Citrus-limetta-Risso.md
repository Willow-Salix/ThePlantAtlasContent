## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Indo-Burmese region, particularly India and surrounding South Asian countries. |
| **Climate** | Subtropical/Tropical Monsoon Climate |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6-8+ hours of direct sunlight daily) reflecting its growth in open, unshaded environments typical of its native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Regular, deep watering, allowing the top few inches of soil to dry out between applications. This mimics the heavy rainfall followed by drier spells of its native monsoonal climate; good drainage is essential. |

## Introduction
Sweet lemon and sweet lime refer to groups of citrus hybrids that contain low acid pulp and juice. They are hybrids often similar to non-sweet lemons or limes, but with less citron parentage. Sweet limes and lemons are not sharply separated:

The sweet lime, Citrus limettioides Tan. (syn. C. lumia Risso et Poit.), is often confused with the sweet lemon, C. limetta Tan., (q.v. under LEMON) which, in certain areas, is referred to as "sweet lime". In some of the literature, it is impossible to tell which fruit is under discussion.
The same plant may also be known by different names:

The Indian sweet lime is the mitha nimbu (numerous modifications and other local names) of India, the limûn helou or succari of Egypt, and the Palestine sweet lime (to distinguish it from the Millsweet and Tunisian limettas, commonly called sweet limes).
The sweet lemons and sweet limes are not derived from either lemons or the more common limes, nor do they represent a monophyletic grouping, having arisen from distinct citrus hybridizations. Plants and fruits with the common name sweet lemon or sweet lime include:

Citrus limetta, small and round like a common lime, with sweet juice, a citron/sour orange hybrid.
Lumia, a large dry citron-like fruit that is pear shaped and not necessarily sweet. This is itself a mixed group: one member has been found to have resulted from a lemon crossing with a citron/pomelo hybrid, a second member is a micrantha/citron mix.
Palestinian sweet lime, Citrus × latifolia, mainly used as a rootstock, a citron/mandarin/pomelo hybrid.
Ujukitsu, Citrus ujukitsu, or 'lemonade fruit', likely a tangelo, a Kishu mikan crossed with a pomelo-like fruit, produced by citrus pioneer Chōzaburō Tanaka.

## Care Guide
Sweet lime thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, characteristic of its subtropical to tropical origins. Consistent, deep watering is crucial, allowing for brief drying periods between applications to mimic monsoonal rainfall. Regular fertilization supports its prolific growth and fruit production.

### Fertilizer
Heavy feeder requiring regular fertilization, especially during active growth and fruiting seasons. Use a balanced citrus-specific fertilizer or a general slow-release fertilizer rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients.
