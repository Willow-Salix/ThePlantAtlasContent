## 🌱 Overview
Erythronium, the fawn lily, trout lily, dog's-tooth violet or adder's tongue, is a genus of Eurasian and North American plants in the lily family, most closely related to tulips. The name Erythronium derives from Ancient Greek ἐρυθρός (eruthrós) "red" in Greek, referring to the red flowers of E. dens-canis. Of all the established species, most live in North America; only six species are found in Europe and Asia.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This spring ephemeral requires full sun to partial shade in early spring, followed by full shade once overhead trees leaf out. Maintain consistently moist, well-drained soil during active growth, allowing it to dry out during summer dormancy. Enrich the soil annually with compost or a balanced fertilizer in early spring.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Thrives in rich, organic soil. A yearly application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can support robust growth.
