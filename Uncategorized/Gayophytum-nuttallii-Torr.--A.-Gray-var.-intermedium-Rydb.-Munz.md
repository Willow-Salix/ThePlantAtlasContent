## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (United States and Canada), particularly the Intermountain West and Pacific Northwest regions (e.g., California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Montane/Subalpine Shrubland & Meadow |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade, reflecting its growth in open woodlands, meadows, and sagebrush scrublands. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out significantly between waterings. Mimics seasonal precipitation patterns with drier periods. |

## Introduction
Gayophytum is a genus of annual herbs in the evening primrose family known commonly as groundsmoke. There are about nine species of groundsmoke, most of which are native to western North America. These are erect flowering herbs generally well under a metre in height and with narrow leaves. They produce white flowers which fade to pink or red.
Species include:

Gayophytum decipiens - deceptive groundsmoke
Gayophytum diffusum - spreading groundsmoke
Gayophytum eriospermum - Coville's groundsmoke
Gayophytum heterozygum - zigzag groundsmoke
Gayophytum humile - dwarf groundsmoke
Gayophytum oligospermum - pinegrove groundsmoke
Gayophytum racemosum - blackfoot groundsmoke
Gayophytum ramosissimum - pinyon groundsmoke

## Care Guide
Nuttall's Groundsmoke prefers full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. Water moderately, allowing the soil to dry between sessions, and apply fertilizer sparingly, especially during its active growth period. This care regimen closely mirrors its native temperate montane and scrubland environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in varying, sometimes disturbed soils, so heavy fertilization is not typically needed but a light feed during the growing season can be beneficial.
