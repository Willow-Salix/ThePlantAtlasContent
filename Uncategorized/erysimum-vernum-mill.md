## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Western Mediterranean region, specifically the Iberian Peninsula (Spain, Portugal) and parts of Northwest Africa. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full Sun to Partial Shade. Prefers full sun for optimal flowering, but can benefit from some afternoon shade in very hot climates. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. It is drought tolerant once established, especially during hot, dry summer periods. |

## 🌱 Overview
Erysimum, or wallflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the cabbage family, Brassicaceae. It includes more than 150 species, both popular garden plants and many wild forms. Erysimum is characterised by star-shaped (and/or two-sided) trichomes growing from the stem, with yellow, red, pink or orange flowers and multiseeded seed pods.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This spring-flowering wallflower thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean climate. Provide it with full sun and well-draining soil, watering moderately but allowing the soil to dry between waterings. It is quite drought-tolerant once established and does not require heavy fertilization.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low. Generally not a heavy feeder; apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer sparingly in spring if soil is particularly poor.
