## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Northern Hemisphere (North America, Europe, Asia) |
| **Climate** | Temperate/Boreal Open Rocky Habitats |
| **Sunlight** | High sun to partial sun; thrives in exposed, well-lit environments. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering, allowing the substrate to dry thoroughly between applications. Tolerant of dry periods, requires excellent drainage. |

## Care Guide
This moss thrives in open, sunny, and dry conditions typical of temperate to boreal rocky outcrops. It requires infrequent watering, allowing its substrate to dry completely between sessions, and prefers mineral-rich, well-draining soil with very low nutrient input.

### Fertilizer
Very low; prefers mineral-rich (often calcareous) substrates and can be harmed by high organic fertilizers. Minimal to no fertilization is needed.
