## 🌱 Overview
Ericameria is a genus of North American shrubs in the family Asteraceae.
Ericameria is known by the common names goldenbush, rabbitbrush, turpentine bush, and rabbitbush. Most are shrubs, but one species (E. parishii) can reach tree stature. They are distributed in western Canada (Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia) western United States (from the western Great Plains to the Pacific) and northern Mexico. Bright yellow flower heads adorn the plants in late summer. All the species have disc florets, while some have ray florets but others do not. Ericameria nauseosa, (synonym Chrysothamnus nauseosus), is known for its production of latex.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Rubber Rabbitbrush is a highly drought-tolerant shrub that thrives in full sun, reflecting its native arid scrubland habitat. It requires minimal watering once established and prefers lean soils, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscapes.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant thrives in poor to average, often alkaline, soils and does not require supplemental fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
