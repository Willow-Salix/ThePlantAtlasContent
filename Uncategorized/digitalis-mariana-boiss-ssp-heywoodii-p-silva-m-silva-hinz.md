## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Portugal |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Mediterranean (Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial shade. In its native hot, dry summers, it often benefits from some afternoon shade to prevent scorching. |
| **💧 Water** | Moderate watering during the active growing season in spring and early summer. Once established, it is relatively drought-tolerant, requiring less water during hot, dry summer periods. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot. |

## 🌱 Overview
Digitalis ( or ) is a genus of about 20 species of herbaceous perennial plants, shrubs, and biennials, commonly called foxgloves.
Digitalis is native to Europe, Western Asia, and northwestern Africa. The flowers are tubular in shape, produced on a tall spike, and vary in colour with species, from purple to pink, white, and yellow. The name derives from the Latin word for "finger". The genus was traditionally placed in the figwort family, Scrophulariaceae, but phylogenetic research led taxonomists to move it to the Veronicaceae in 2001. More recent phylogenetic work has placed it in the much enlarged family Plantaginaceae.
The best-known species is the common foxglove, Digitalis purpurea. This biennial is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its vivid flowers, which range in colour from various purple tints through pink and purely white. The flowers can also possess various marks and spottings. Other garden-worthy species include D. ferruginea, D. grandiflora, D. lutea, and D. parviflora.
The term digitalis is also used for drug preparations that contain cardiac glycosides, particularly one called digoxin, extracted from various plants of this genus. Foxglove has medicinal uses but is also very toxic to humans and other mammals, such that consumption can cause serious illness or death.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Mariana Foxglove thrives in a Mediterranean climate, preferring full sun to partial shade, with some protection from intense afternoon sun in hotter regions. It requires moderate watering during its growth phase but becomes drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize lightly in spring for optimal health.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding is sufficient. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring as new growth begins. Avoid excessive fertilization, especially in well-draining, moderately fertile soils.
