## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico) and northern Mexico |
| **Climate** | Montane Semi-arid (High-elevation grasslands, open woodlands, and subalpine meadows, characterized by cold winters, hot summers, and seasonal precipitation including snowmelt and summer monsoons) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial shade. Thrives in open, sunny clearings or areas with dappled shade in its native montane habitat. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering. Requires consistent moisture during its active growth phase (spring and early summer) but is adapted to tolerate drier periods later in the season. Good drainage is essential. |

## Introduction
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.
All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida. Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.
The genus name Delphinium derives from the Ancient Greek word δελφίνιον (delphínion) which means "dolphin", a name used in De Materia Medica for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

## Care Guide
This montane perennial thrives in full sun to partial shade within well-drained soil. It needs moderate, consistent watering during its growing season but can tolerate some drought once established. Provide low to moderate fertilization to support its growth.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer application in spring, as montane soils are often well-drained but not exceptionally rich.
