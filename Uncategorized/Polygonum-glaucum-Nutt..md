## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of North America (United States) |
| **Climate** | Coastal Temperate/Subtropical Dune Ecosystem |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun exposure, mimicking its natural habitat on open beaches and dunes. |
| **Watering** | Frequent watering, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings, as it thrives in well-drained sandy soils that drain quickly. |

## Introduction
Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita (c. 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.
The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.
Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

## Care Guide
Seaside Knotweed thrives in full sun and very well-drained sandy soils, characteristic of its native coastal dune habitats. It requires frequent watering, but excellent drainage is paramount to prevent waterlogging. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, so minimal fertilization is needed.

### Fertilizer
Low to minimal fertilization; adapted to nutrient-poor coastal sands, an annual light feeding in spring is sufficient if growth appears stunted.
