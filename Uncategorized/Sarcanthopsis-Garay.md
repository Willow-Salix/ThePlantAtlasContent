## Introduction
Sarcanthopsis, commonly known as goliath orchids, is a genus of six species of flowering plants from the orchid family, Orchidaceae. Plants in this genus are large epiphytes or lithophytes with long, thick, leathery stems, large, crowded leathery leaves and many yellowish flowers on a branched flowering stem. Orchids in this genus occur in New Guinea and islands of the south-west Pacific.

## Care Guide
Sarcanthopsis Garay thrives in conditions replicating its native tropical lowland rainforest, requiring bright, indirect light and high humidity. Water frequently, ensuring the roots dry slightly between applications, and provide regular, dilute orchid fertilizer. These epiphytic orchids appreciate good air circulation.

### Fertilizer
Weak, balanced orchid-specific fertilizer applied regularly (e.g., every 1-2 weeks during active growth) to compensate for the sparse nutrient environment of an epiphyte.
