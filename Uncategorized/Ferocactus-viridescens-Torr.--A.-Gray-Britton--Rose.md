## Care Guide
This San Diego barrel cactus thrives in conditions mimicking its native semi-arid coastal scrub habitat, demanding full sun exposure and extremely infrequent watering. Ensure well-draining soil and provide minimal fertilizer to support its slow growth, allowing the soil to dry completely between watering cycles.

### Fertilizer
Low; use a diluted, balanced cactus fertilizer once or twice during the growing season (spring/early summer).
