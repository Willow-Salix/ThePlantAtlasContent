## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | South America (primarily Brazil) |
| **Climate** | Tropical to Subtropical Moist Forest |
| **Sunlight** | Indirect to filtered light; avoid direct, intense sun which can cause desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires high ambient humidity and frequent moisture from misting or rainfall, allowing for brief dry periods between hydration cycles. |

## Introduction
Rinodina is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Physciaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 265 species. It is hypothesized that a few saxicolous species common to dry regions of western North America, southern Europe, North Africa and central Asia may date back 240 million years to the Middle Triassic.

## Care Guide
This epiphytic lichen thrives in environments mimicking its native tropical and subtropical moist forests, requiring high humidity and filtered light. Provide frequent moisture through misting and maintain high ambient humidity, while strictly avoiding direct sun and any form of traditional fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Extremely low nutrient needs; fertilization is generally not recommended as lichens derive nutrients from air and substrate, and excess can be harmful.
