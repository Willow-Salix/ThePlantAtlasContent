## Introduction
Callitriche is a genus of largely aquatic plants known as water-starwort. Previously, it was the only genus in the family Callitrichaceae. However, according to the APG II system this family is now included in the Plantaginaceae (plantain family). The family name Callitrichaceae retains its status as nomen conservandum (name to be retained).

## Care Guide
This aquatic plant thrives in cool, clear freshwater, requiring constant submersion and preferring full sun to partial shade. Due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments, minimal or no fertilization is necessary, and over-fertilizing should be avoided.

### Fertilizer
Low, thrives in nutrient-poor waters; excessive fertilization should be avoided as it can be detrimental.
