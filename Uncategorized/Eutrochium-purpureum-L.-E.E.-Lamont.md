## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist, rich soil to flourish. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry periods, and enrich the soil with organic matter annually. It's an excellent choice for wetland gardens or areas with naturally damp conditions, needing minimal additional fertilizer if soil is rich.

### Fertilizer
Thrives in rich, fertile soil. Amend with compost or other organic matter annually to maintain fertility. Supplemental fertilizer is generally not needed if soil is rich.
