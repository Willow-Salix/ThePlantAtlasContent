## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico (particularly arid and semi-arid regions) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland / Desert |
| **Sunlight** | Requires full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) to thrive, reflecting its open, exposed native habitat. |
| **Watering** | Extremely drought-tolerant; water infrequently and deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, typical of desert rainfall patterns. |

## Introduction
Agave (; also UK: ; Anglo-Hispanic, also US: ) is a genus of monocots native to the arid regions of the Americas. The genus is primarily known for its succulent and xerophytic species that typically form large rosettes of strong, fleshy leaves.
Many plants in this genus may be considered perennial, because they require several to many years to mature and flower. However, most Agave species are more accurately described as monocarpic rosettes or multiannuals, since each individual rosette flowers only once and then dies; a small number of Agave species are polycarpic.
Along with plants from the closely related genera Yucca, Hesperoyucca, and Hesperaloe, various Agave species are popular ornamental plants in hot, dry climates, as they require very little supplemental water to survive. Most Agave species grow very slowly. Some Agave species are known by the common name "century plant".
Maguey is a Spanish word that refers to all of the large-leafed plants in the Asparagaceae family, including agaves and yuccas. Maguey flowers are eaten in many indigenous culinary traditions of Mesoamerica.
In other regions, it goes by different names; in China, it is referred to as Chinese: 龙舌兰, romanized: Lóngshélán, lit. 'dragon tongue orchid'.

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, mimicking its native arid environment. Water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry completely, and fertilize sparingly. Ensure protection from frost as it is not cold-hardy.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilizer needs; feed sparingly, if at all, during the growing season with a balanced, slow-release succulent fertilizer due to naturally poor desert soils.
