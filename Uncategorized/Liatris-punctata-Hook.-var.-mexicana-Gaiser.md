## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southern United States (e.g., Texas, New Mexico, Arizona) and Northern Mexico (e.g., Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Sonora) |
| **Climate** | Semi-Arid Grasslands and Chihuahuan Desert Scrub |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight daily), as it naturally grows in open, exposed plains and dry grasslands. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant once established; water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings to mimic its native arid conditions. |

## Introduction
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## Care Guide
The Mexican Blazing Star thrives in full sun and well-drained, lean soils, typical of its native semi-arid grasslands. It requires minimal watering once established due to its drought tolerance. Avoid over-fertilizing to maintain its compact growth habit.

### Fertilizer
Prefers lean to moderately fertile, well-drained soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary and can lead to leggy growth; if used, apply a very light, balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring.
