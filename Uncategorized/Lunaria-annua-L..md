## Introduction
Lunaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to North America and elsewhere. Species include:

L. annua (syn. L. biennis), annual or biennial
L. rediviva, perennial
L. telekiana. rare Balkan species
The Latin name Lunaria means "moon-like" and refers to the plants' decorative seedpods.
They have hairy toothed leaves and terminal racemes of white or violet flowers in Spring and Summer, followed by prominent, translucent, disc-shaped seedpods, which are frequently seen in flower arrangements.
They are widely grown as ornamental plants in gardens, and have become naturalised in many temperate areas away from their native habitat.

Annual Honesty prefers partial sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil in temperate conditions. Ensure regular watering, especially during dry spells, and provide average to rich soil for optimal growth. Light fertilization can be applied in spring if needed.

### Fertilizer
Light feeder; thrives in average to rich, well-draining soil. Light fertilization in spring is optional if soil is poor.
