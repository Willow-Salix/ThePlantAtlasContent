## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Mexico, Central America |
| **Climate** | Warm Temperate to Subtropical Riparian (e.g., streambanks, moist canyons) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun. As a large deciduous tree, it requires direct sunlight for optimal growth and canopy development. |
| **Watering** | Regular watering is essential, especially for young trees and during dry periods, to ensure consistently moist soil. Established trees exhibit moderate drought tolerance but thrive with ample moisture, reflecting their native riparian habitat. |

## Introduction
Platanus ( PLAT-ən-əss) is a genus consisting of a small number of tree species. They are the sole living members of the family Platanaceae.
All mature members of Platanus are tall, reaching 30–50 m (98–164 ft) in height. The type species of the genus is the Oriental plane Platanus orientalis. All except for P. kerrii are deciduous, and most are found in riparian or other wetland habitats in the wild, though proving drought-tolerant in cultivation. The hybrid London plane (Platanus × hispanica) has proved particularly tolerant of urban conditions, and has been widely planted in London and elsewhere across the temperate world.
They are often known in English as planes  or plane trees. A formerly used name that is now rare is plantain tree (not to be confused with other, unrelated, species with the name). Some North American species are called sycamores (especially Platanus occidentalis), although the term is also used for several unrelated species of trees. The genus name Platanus comes from Ancient Greek πλάτανος, which referred to Platanus orientalis.

## Care Guide
This large deciduous tree thrives in full sun and requires consistent moisture, mimicking its native riparian environment. Provide regular watering, particularly when young and during dry spells, and support growth with a moderate, balanced fertilizer application in spring. Ensuring well-drained, consistently moist soil is key for its health.

### Fertilizer
Moderate. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer application in early spring can support vigorous growth, particularly in less fertile soils or for young specimens.
