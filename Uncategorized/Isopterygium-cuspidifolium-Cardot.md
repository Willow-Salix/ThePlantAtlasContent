## 🧤 Care Instructions
This tropical moss thrives in environments mimicking its native rainforest floor, demanding consistently high humidity and very low light. Ensure its growing medium remains continuously moist, often through regular misting. Fertilization should be minimal or avoided entirely to prevent harm.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. A highly diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., 1/4 strength) once a month during active growth, or none at all, as mosses are not heavy feeders.
