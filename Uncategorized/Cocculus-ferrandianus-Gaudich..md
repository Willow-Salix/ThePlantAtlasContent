## Care Guide
This liana, endemic to New Caledonia's dry forests, thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions to mimic its native conditions. Light fertilization during active growth will support its development in well-draining soil.

### Fertilizer
Light fertilization during the growing season; minimal otherwise.
