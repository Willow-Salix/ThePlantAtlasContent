## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America (USA: California, Nevada, Oregon) |
| **Climate** | Arid Scrubland, High Desert, Pinyon-Juniper Woodland |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) due to its native open, exposed habitats. |
| **Watering** | Infrequent watering; allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Highly drought-tolerant once established, mirroring its adaptation to low rainfall environments. |

## Introduction
Linanthus is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the phlox family Polemoniaceae. The species are found in western North America and in Chile, with the greatest diversity in California.
The stems are erect, with multiple branches arising directly from the base, and grow 2–15 cm tall. The leaves are stem-like (cauline) and opposite, with shapes ranging from entire to palmately lobed, the 3-9 lobes being linear to lanceolate or spatulate. Flowers have a tubular calyx, and the corolla may be funnel- or bell-shaped, or salverform.
The genus name is from the Greek for "flax flower", since the flowers superficially resemble those of flax. The genus has recently been split, with many of the species formerly included now transferred to the genus Leptosiphon (Jepson Manual).

## Care Guide
This plant requires full sun and excellent drainage, thriving in conditions that mimic its native arid, rocky habitats. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and avoid rich fertilizers. It is well-suited for xeriscaping or rock gardens.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. Its native soils are often nutrient-poor, so it thrives in lean conditions. Over-fertilization can be detrimental.
