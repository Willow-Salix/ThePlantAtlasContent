| **Climate** | Temperate Grassland/Steppe |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun (prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily) |
| **Watering** | Low to moderate; tolerant of dry conditions once established, reflecting its native habitat in well-drained, often dry soils. Water deeply but infrequently. |

## Introduction
Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (A. chilensis, A. linearifolia, A. sleumeri) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat's-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.
Different Antennaria species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name Antennaria refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae.
Antennaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady), Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).

## Care Guide
Lunell's Pussytoes thrives in conditions mimicking its native temperate grasslands, preferring full to partial sun exposure. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, requiring infrequent watering. Minimal to no fertilization is necessary, as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in lean to moderately fertile soils. Fertilization is generally not necessary and can promote leggy growth over flowering.
