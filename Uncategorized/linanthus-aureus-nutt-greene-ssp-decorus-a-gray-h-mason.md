## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |

| **🌡️ Climate** | Arid to Semi-arid Shrubland and Desert, Mediterranean (dry summers, wet winters) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily), consistent with its open, exposed native habitats. |
| **💧 Water** | Infrequent, deep watering. Allow soil to dry completely between waterings, mimicking its native drought-tolerant conditions. |

## 🌱 Overview
Linanthus is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the phlox family Polemoniaceae. The species are found in western North America and in Chile, with the greatest diversity in California.
The stems are erect, with multiple branches arising directly from the base, and grow 2–15 cm tall. The leaves are stem-like (cauline) and opposite, with shapes ranging from entire to palmately lobed, the 3-9 lobes being linear to lanceolate or spatulate. Flowers have a tubular calyx, and the corolla may be funnel- or bell-shaped, or salverform.
The genus name is from the Greek for "flax flower", since the flowers superficially resemble those of flax. The genus has recently been split, with many of the species formerly included now transferred to the genus Leptosiphon (Jepson Manual).

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, reflecting its origins in arid and semi-arid regions. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely, and avoid heavy fertilization. It is highly drought-tolerant once established.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to no fertilizer. Native soils are typically lean; over-fertilization can be detrimental. If necessary, a very dilute, balanced fertilizer can be applied sparingly during the growing season.
