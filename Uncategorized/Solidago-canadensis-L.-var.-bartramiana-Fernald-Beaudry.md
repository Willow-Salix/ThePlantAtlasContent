## Care Guide
Canada Goldenrod is a robust North American native, flourishing in full to partial sun and adaptable to various soil types. It is quite drought-tolerant once established but appreciates moderate watering, with minimal fertilizer needs. This makes it a low-maintenance and versatile plant.

### Fertilizer
Low; thrives in average to poor soils and typically does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring is sufficient if growth is poor.
