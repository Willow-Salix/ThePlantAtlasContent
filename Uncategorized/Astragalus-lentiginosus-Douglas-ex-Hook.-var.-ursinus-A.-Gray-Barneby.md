## Care Guide
Spotted Locoweed is a hardy plant adapted to arid environments, requiring full sun and minimal watering once established. It thrives in well-draining soil and has very low fertilizer needs, reflecting its native desert and shrubland origins.

### Fertilizer
Low; typically not required as it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. If growth is very poor, a very light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer once a year in spring may be beneficial.
