## Introduction
Psychotria is a large genus of flowering plants in the coffee family Rubiaceae, with over 1,600 species. The genus has a pantropical distribution and members of the genus are small understorey trees in tropical forests. Some species are endangered or facing extinction due to deforestation, especially species of central Africa and the Pacific.
Many species, including Psychotria viridis, produce the psychedelic chemical dimethyltryptamine (DMT).

## Care Guide
This tropical plant requires consistent moisture, high humidity, and filtered light to thrive. Protect it from direct sun and ensure the soil remains moist but well-draining. Fertilize sparingly during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler months.
