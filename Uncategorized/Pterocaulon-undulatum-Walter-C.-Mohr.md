## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Southeastern United States (e.g., Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia) |
| **Climate** | Humid Subtropical Open Woodlands/Pine Flatwoods |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun, reflecting its growth in open clearings, pine flatwoods, and roadsides where it receives ample light. |
| **Watering** | Moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Its native habitat of dry to moist, well-drained soils suggests it tolerates some drought but thrives with consistent, but not excessive, moisture. |

## Introduction
Pterocaulon is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, native to North and South America and to Australasia. Blackroot is a common name for species native to North America.
The plants are perennial herbs, frequently densely covered with woolly hairs. The generic name means "winged stem," referring to the decurrent leaf bases that give the appearance of wings running down the sides of the stems.

## Care Guide
Pterocaulon undulatum thrives in a humid subtropical environment, preferring full to partial sun and well-drained soil. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between applications, and has low to moderate fertilizer needs due to its native habitat in sandy, open woodlands.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. Growing in sandhills and pine flatwoods indicates adaptation to relatively poor to moderately fertile, well-draining soils.
