## Care Guide
The Sonoma Rose thrives in conditions mimicking its native Mediterranean climate, preferring full sun and well-draining soil. While drought-tolerant once established, it benefits from moderate watering during prolonged dry spells in summer. A light, annual fertilization in spring is sufficient to support healthy growth.

### Fertilizer
