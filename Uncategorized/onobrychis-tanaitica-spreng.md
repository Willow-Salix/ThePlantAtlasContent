## 🧤 Care Instructions
Tanais Sainfoin thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, mimicking its native steppe environment. It is drought-tolerant once established, requiring moderate watering and generally light fertilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Ensure good drainage to prevent root issues.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light to moderate fertilization. As a legume, it fixes nitrogen, so high nitrogen fertilizers are generally not required. A balanced, all-purpose fertilizer can be applied sparingly in spring if soil is poor.
