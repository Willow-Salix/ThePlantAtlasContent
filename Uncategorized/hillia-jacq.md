## 🧤 Care Instructions
Hillia plants require a humid environment with bright, indirect light, mirroring their native tropical rainforest habitat. Maintain consistent moisture in a well-draining substrate and provide diluted, regular fertilization to support their epiphytic growth style.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer, diluted to half or quarter strength, applied every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season. As an epiphyte, it is not accustomed to rich soil nutrients.
