## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Circumpolar Arctic and Boreal regions, including North America (Greenland, Canada, Alaska, northern USA), Europe (Scandinavia), and Asia (Siberia). |
| **Climate** | Arctic/Boreal Tundra and Subalpine regions, characterized by cool temperatures, high humidity, and often boggy or very moist conditions along streams and wet rocks. |
| **Sunlight** | Low to moderate indirect light; thrives in partial to full shade, as it is sensitive to direct, intense sun which can lead to desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires consistently moist to saturated conditions; the substrate should never dry out. High environmental humidity is crucial for its survival. |

## Introduction
Tritomaria is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Lophoziaceae.
The genus was first described by Victor Félix Schiffner based on an earlier description by Leopold Loeske.
The genus has cosmopolitan distribution.

## Care Guide
Tritomaria polita thrives in cool, consistently moist, high-humidity environments with low to moderate indirect light. It requires a substrate that remains wet or periodically saturated and has very low nutrient demands, making fertilization generally unnecessary and potentially harmful.

### Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer. As a bryophyte adapted to nutrient-poor bogs and rocks, it is sensitive to high nutrient concentrations.
