## Care Guide
Desert Sand Verbena thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean soil, typical of its arid native habitat. It requires minimal water, tolerating drought conditions well, and generally does not need fertilization. Overwatering is the most common cause of failure.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. Native desert soils are typically poor in nutrients, so heavy fertilization is unnecessary and can be harmful.
