## Care Guide
Toumey's Evening Primrose is a resilient desert plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. It requires minimal water once established, making it ideal for xeriscaping, and tolerates poor soil with little need for fertilization.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate fertilization. A light, balanced fertilizer application once in early spring may be beneficial, but often not necessary in average to poor soils.
