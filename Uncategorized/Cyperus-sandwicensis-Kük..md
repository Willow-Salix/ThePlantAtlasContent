## Care Guide
The Cliffs Flatsedge thrives in full sun, mimicking its native Hawaiian cliff environment. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires excellent drainage, preferring infrequent watering once the soil has dried out. Fertilization needs are minimal, suitable for lean soil conditions.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Being adapted to rocky, lean soils, it does not require heavy fertilization. A balanced, slow-release fertilizer once or twice during the growing season is sufficient.
