## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and Subtropical regions globally, including parts of South America (e.g., Brazil, Colombia) and Central America (e.g., Panama) |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest |
| **☀️ Light** | Partial shade to dappled sunlight. As an epiphyte in dense rainforests, it naturally receives filtered light and should be protected from direct, intense sun. |
| **💧 Water** | Requires very high atmospheric humidity and frequent moisture from rain or mist, absorbing water directly from the air and precipitation. No traditional soil watering is needed, as it does not grow in soil. |

## 🌱 Overview
Pertusaria is a large genus of warty crustose lichens in the Pertusariaceae family. The fruiting bodies are usually modified apothecia that immersed in warts on the main body (thallus) with small holes for the spores to emerge, similar to ostioles, or are fully above and lecanorine (spore bearing discs surrounded by a ring of tissue similar to the tissue of the thallus.  Members of the genus are commonly called wart lichens.
The widespread genus contains over 500 species.
Classification in the large genus relies heavily on thallus chemistry to distinguish and classify species, some of which differ only in the presence or absence of a single secondary chemical. Lichexanthone, norlichexanthone, and their chlorinated derivatives are common in this genus.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This lichen thrives in environments with very high humidity and indirect, filtered light, replicating its tropical rainforest origins. It absorbs moisture and nutrients directly from the air and precipitation, meaning no traditional watering or soil-based fertilizers are required. Protecting it from direct sun and air pollution is crucial for its survival.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Does not require soil-based fertilizers. It obtains necessary nutrients from atmospheric dust, gases, and rainfall, and is sensitive to air pollution.
