## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Primarily Southeast Asia (e.g., India, Thailand, Vietnam) and parts of tropical Africa. |
| **Climate** | Tropical and Subtropical Moist, characterized by high temperatures and significant rainfall, often found in open grasslands, disturbed sites, and agricultural areas. |
| **Sunlight** | Full Sun. As an aggressive grass found in open, disturbed areas, it requires abundant direct sunlight for optimal growth and spread. |
| **Watering** | Consistent Moisture. Given its prevalence in tropical and subtropical moist climates and agricultural fields, it needs regular and ample watering, especially during active growth periods, but also tolerates brief dry spells due to its weed-like resilience. |

## Introduction
Rottboellia (commonly called itch grass) is a genus of African, Asian, and Australian plants in the grass family.
The genus was named in honour of Danish botanist Christen Friis Rottbøll (1727-1797).

## Care Guide
This vigorous grass thrives in full sun and requires consistent moisture in warm, tropical-like conditions. While not overly demanding, it benefits from moderate soil fertility to support its rapid growth and spread, characteristic of a robust weed.

### Fertilizer
Moderate Fertility. As a vigorous weed, it can thrive in a range of soil types but benefits from moderate nutrient availability, indicating it's not particularly demanding but will respond well to balanced feeding during its growing season.
