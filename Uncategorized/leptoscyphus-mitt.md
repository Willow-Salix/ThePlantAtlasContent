## 🧤 Care Instructions
This liverwort thrives in consistently moist, highly humid conditions with low to moderate indirect light, mimicking its native tropical montane rainforest habitat. Provide regular moisture, high ambient humidity, and very infrequent, highly diluted fertilization for optimal growth.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Very low. Use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer (1/8 to 1/4 strength) infrequently, typically once every 2-3 months, as epiphytic plants derive nutrients from rain and decaying matter.
