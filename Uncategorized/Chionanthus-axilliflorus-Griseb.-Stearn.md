## Care Guide
This tropical tree thrives in warm, humid conditions with partial shade and consistently moist soil, reflecting its native forest understory habitat. Provide regular, yet not waterlogged, irrigation and light, balanced fertilization during the active growing season. Protection from harsh, direct sunlight is crucial.

### Fertilizer
A light to moderate feeder. Apply a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer once in spring or a diluted liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season (spring to early fall). Avoid over-fertilizing.
