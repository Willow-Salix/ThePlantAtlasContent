## Care Guide
Burnets are hardy perennials well-suited to temperate gardens, preferring full sun to partial shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil. They are relatively low-maintenance, requiring moderate watering and only occasional light fertilization to thrive and establish in the landscape.

### Fertilizer
Light to moderate feeding; a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring is beneficial if soil is naturally lean, as meadow soils are not excessively rich.
