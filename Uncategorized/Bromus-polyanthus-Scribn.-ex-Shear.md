## Introduction
Bromus is a large genus of grasses, classified in its own tribe Bromeae. They are commonly known as bromes, brome grasses, cheat grasses, or chess grasses. Estimates in the scientific literature of the number of species have ranged from 100 to 400, but plant taxonomists currently recognize around 160–170 species.
Bromus is part of the cool-season grass lineage (subfamily Pooideae), which includes about 3300 species.  Within Pooideae, Bromus is classified in tribe Bromeae (it is the only genus in the tribe).  Bromus is closely related to the wheat-grass lineage (tribe Triticeae) that includes such economically important genera as Triticum (wheat), Hordeum (barley) and Secale (rye).

## Care Guide
Great Basin Brome is a low-maintenance grass that thrives in full sun and arid conditions. Ensure it receives infrequent, deep watering and has well-draining soil, as it is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to lean nutrient environments.

### Fertilizer
Low to none. This plant thrives in lean soils and generally does not require supplemental fertilization. If growth is poor, a very light, slow-release, balanced fertilizer can be applied in spring.
