## Care Guide
Echeveria arizonica thrives in conditions mimicking its native desert environment, requiring abundant sunlight and minimal water. Provide very well-draining soil and allow it to dry out entirely between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilize lightly and infrequently during its active growth period.

### Fertilizer
Low fertilization; a balanced, diluted succulent fertilizer applied sparingly during the growing season (spring/summer).
