## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Subarctic and subalpine regions across Eurasia and North America, including Scandinavia, Siberia, Alaska, and mountainous areas of Europe and Canada. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Alpine Tundra/Boreal Forest (Taiga) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; prefers open, exposed locations characteristic of high-latitude or high-altitude environments. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistently moist to wet soil; requires frequent watering, mimicking its natural habitat near streams, bogs, and wet meadows. |

## 🌱 Overview
Willows, also called sallows and osiers, of the genus Salix, comprise around 350 species (plus numerous hybrids) of typically deciduous trees and shrubs. They are primarily found on moist soils in cold and temperate regions.
Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 centimetres (2+1⁄2 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Halberd Willow thrives in cool, moist, and open environments, reflective of its subarctic and subalpine origins. It demands ample sunlight and consistently wet soil conditions to mimic its natural habitat near water bodies. Minimal fertilization is typically sufficient, as it is adapted to leaner soils.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to moderate; adapted to nutrient-poor to average soils common in cold, high-altitude or subarctic regions. Fertilize sparingly.
