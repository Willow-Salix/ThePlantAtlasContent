## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Widespread across temperate and subtropical regions globally, including Europe and North America. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to subtropical humid environments, often found in woodlands, open rocky areas, or disturbed sites with consistent moisture. |
| **Sunlight** | Partial shade to moderate indirect light; can tolerate more sun exposure if high atmospheric humidity is maintained to prevent desiccation. |
| **Watering** | Requires frequent rehydration from atmospheric moisture like rain, dew, or mist. For indoor care, regular misting is essential; it does not require traditional watering of soil. |

## Introduction
Collema (jelly lichen) is a genus of lichens in the family Collemataceae. The photobiont is the cyanobacterium genus Nostoc. Species in this genus typically grow on nutrient-rich bark or somewhat siliceous or calcareous rocks in humid environments.

## Care Guide
Collema cheileum is a gelatinous lichen adapted to temperate to subtropical humid conditions, preferring partial shade to moderate light. It thrives with frequent atmospheric moisture for rehydration, rather than soil watering. No fertilizer is needed, as it naturally absorbs nutrients from its environment.

### Fertilizer
No supplemental fertilizer is required. Lichens obtain all necessary nutrients directly from the air and their substrate, and fertilizers can be detrimental.
