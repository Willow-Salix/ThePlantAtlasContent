## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, specifically the Rocky Mountains region (e.g., Montana, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming in the U.S.; British Columbia, Alberta in Canada) |
| **Climate** | Temperate Coniferous Forest / Montane Forest (characterized by cold, snowy winters and moderate summers) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun (requiring at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily) as it typically grows in open mountainous areas or as a canopy tree. |
| **Watering** | Moderate. Prefers consistently moist, well-drained soil. Requires regular watering, especially when young and during dry periods, but established trees have some drought tolerance due to their native habitat. |

## Introduction
Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca, or Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, is an evergreen conifer native to the interior mountainous regions of western North America, from central British Columbia and southwest Alberta in Canada southward through the United States to the far north of Mexico. The range is continuous in the northern Rocky Mountains south to eastern Washington, eastern Oregon, Idaho, western and south-central Montana and western Wyoming, but becomes discontinuous further south, confined to "sky islands" on the higher mountains in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, with only very isolated small populations in eastern Nevada, westernmost Texas, and northern Mexico. It occurs from 600 m altitude in the north of the range, up to 3,000 m, rarely 3,200 m, in the south. Further west towards the Pacific coast, it is replaced by the related coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii), and to the south, it is replaced by Mexican Douglas-fir in high mountains as far south as Oaxaca. Some botanists have grouped Mexican Douglas-fir with P. menziesii var. glauca, but genetic and morphological evidence suggest that Mexican populations should be considered a different variety (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. lindleyana).
Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is most commonly treated as a variety (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), but has also been called a subspecies (Pseudotsuga menziesii subsp. glauca) or more rarely (mainly in the past) a distinct species (Pseudotsuga glauca). The strong ecological and genetic differentiation with intergradation limited primarily to postglacial contact zones in British Columbia supports infraspecific groupings. Some botanists have further split Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir into two varieties, but these are not widely acknowledged and have only limited support from genetic testing.

## Care Guide
The Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir thrives in full sun and cool, temperate climates with well-drained soil. Provide consistent moisture, particularly when young and during dry spells, and fertilize sparingly to support its natural growth in lean mountainous soils.

### Fertilizer
Low. Generally, established trees require little to no supplemental fertilization. Young trees may benefit from a light application of a balanced, slow-release evergreen fertilizer in early spring.
