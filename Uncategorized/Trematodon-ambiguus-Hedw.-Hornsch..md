## Care Guide
This moss thrives in cool, consistently wet, and humid conditions, typical of its native bog environments. Provide plenty of indirect light or partial shade and ensure the substrate never dries out. Fertilization is rarely needed due to its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.

### Fertilizer
Very minimal to no fertilizer. Bog environments are naturally nutrient-poor, and mosses are not heavy feeders. If used, apply a highly diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer very sparingly.
