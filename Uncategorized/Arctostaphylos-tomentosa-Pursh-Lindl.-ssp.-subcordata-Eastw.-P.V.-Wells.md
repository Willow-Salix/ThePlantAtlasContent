| **Native Origin** | Santa Cruz Island, Channel Islands, California, USA |
| **Climate** | Mediterranean Climate (Coastal Chaparral and Scrubland) |
| **Sunlight** | Full sun to partial sun; thrives in open, exposed conditions. |
| **Watering** | Drought-tolerant. Requires infrequent, deep watering during the establishment phase and cooler growing season, but very little to no water during the hot, dry summer dormancy. Excellent drainage is essential. |

## Introduction
Arctostaphylos (; from ἄρκτος árktos "bear" and σταφυλή staphulḗ "bunch of grapes") is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of Arctostaphylos, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves 1–7 cm (0.4–3 in) long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.
Arctostaphylos species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora arctostaphyli (which feeds exclusively on A. uva-ursi) and Coleophora glaucella.

## Care Guide
The Santa Cruz Island Manzanita prefers full sun and well-draining soil, thriving in conditions that mimic its native Mediterranean chaparral. Once established, it is highly drought-tolerant, requiring minimal water, particularly during the dry summer months. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it is adapted to lean soils.

### Fertilizer
Very low to no fertilizer. Manzanitas are adapted to nutrient-poor soils; excess fertilization can be detrimental.
