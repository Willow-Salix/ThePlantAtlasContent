## Introduction
Caloplaca is a lichen genus comprising a number of distinct species. Members of the genus are commonly called firedot lichen, jewel lichen. gold lichens, "orange lichens", but they are not always orange, as in the case of C. albovariegata. The distribution of this lichen genus is worldwide, extending from Antarctica to the high Arctic. It includes a portion of northern North America and the Russian High Arctic. There are about thirty species of Caloplaca in the flora of the British Isles.
A new species of Caloplaca, C. obamae, the first species to be named in honor of Barack Obama, was discovered in 2007 on Santa Rosa Island in California and published in March 2009.

## Care Guide
This saxicolous lichen thrives in exposed, rocky environments mimicking its temperate montane origin. It requires full sun exposure and can tolerate cycles of wet and dry conditions, absorbing moisture directly from the environment. Avoid traditional fertilization as it is sensitive to excess nutrients.

### Fertilizer
None; sensitive to excess nutrients.
