## 🌱 Overview
Solanum umbelliferum is a species of nightshade known commonly as bluewitch nightshade,  or bluewitch. It can be found in chaparral habitat and low-elevation oak woodlands in California and parts of Baja California and Arizona. It is a small perennial herb or subshrub with dark gray-green oval-shaped leaves on hairy green stems that grow to a maximum height of one meter. It has bright purple or blue frilly flowers with thick yellow anthers at the center. The flowers close into spherical buds overnight. It bears small round green fruits which turn purple when ripe and resemble tiny eggplants.
It is a tough shrub which can grow in rocky and clay soils and springs up in areas recovering from wildfires or other disturbances. Like most other members of genus Solanum, S. umbelliferum contains toxic alkaloids.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
Bluewitch Nightshade thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil, characteristic of its Mediterranean native habitat. It is highly drought-tolerant once established, needing moderate water during cooler growing periods and very little during dry summers. Fertilization should be minimal, as it prefers lean soil conditions.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Low to none. Native to lean soils; excessive fertilization can be harmful. A light, balanced fertilizer may be applied sparingly in early spring if soil nutrients are very poor.
