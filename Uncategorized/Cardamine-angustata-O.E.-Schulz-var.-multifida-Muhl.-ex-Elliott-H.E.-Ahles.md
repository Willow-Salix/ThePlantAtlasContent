## Care Guide
This woodland plant thrives in cool, moist, and shady conditions, mimicking its native forest understory environment. Ensure consistently moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Provide protection from harsh direct sunlight to prevent leaf scorch.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate; benefits from organic-rich soil or light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer.
