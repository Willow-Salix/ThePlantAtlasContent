## Care Guide
As a lichen, Chiodecton montagnaei thrives in environments with consistent high humidity and low to moderate indirect light. It does not require soil or traditional watering methods, instead relying on ambient moisture and air for sustenance. Maintaining stable, humid conditions is key for its survival.

### Fertilizer
No traditional fertilizer required; lichens obtain nutrients from the atmosphere and their substrate.
