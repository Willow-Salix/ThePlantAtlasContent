## Introduction
Sporobolus is a nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family. The name Sporobolus means "seed-thrower", and is derived from Ancient Greek word σπόρος (spóros), meaning "seed", and the root of βάλλειν (bállein) "to throw", referring to the dispersion of seeds. Members of the genus are usually called dropseeds or sacaton grasses. They are typical prairie and savanna plants, occurring in other types of open habitat in warmer climates. At least one species (S. caespitosus from Saint Helena) is threatened with extinction, and another (S. durus from Ascension Island) is extinct.

## Care Guide
This resilient grass thrives in full sun and well-draining, often poor, soils characteristic of its arid native habitat. Water sparingly, allowing the soil to fully dry out between deep applications to mimic natural rainfall patterns. Its low-maintenance nature makes it an excellent choice for xeriscaping or drought-tolerant landscapes.

### Fertilizer
Very low; thrives in poor soils. Minimal to no fertilization is required, as excessive nutrients can be detrimental.
