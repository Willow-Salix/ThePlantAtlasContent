## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Origin** | Western North America, primarily California, Oregon, Washington, extending to British Columbia and Baja California. |
| **Climate** | Temperate to Mediterranean, often found in habitats like meadows, open woodlands, chaparral, and montane slopes, characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters in many regions. |
| **Sunlight** | Thrives in full sun to partial shade. Optimal growth and flowering typically occur with full sun exposure, especially in cooler parts of its native range. In hotter, more arid regions, some afternoon shade can be beneficial. |
| **Watering** | Requires moderate watering during the active growing season, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Once established, most species are drought-tolerant and can survive with infrequent watering, especially during dry summer periods, mimicking their native Mediterranean climate. |

## Introduction
Potentilla  is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.
Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related Waldsteinia fragarioides. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

## Care Guide
Horkelia is a low-maintenance plant well-suited to conditions mimicking its native western North American habitats. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, tolerating dry conditions once established with moderate watering. Minimal fertilization is needed for healthy growth and prolific flowering.

### Fertilizer
Low. Horkelia is adapted to relatively lean soils and generally does not require heavy fertilization. A light application of a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer in early spring can be beneficial in very poor soils, but over-fertilization should be avoided.
