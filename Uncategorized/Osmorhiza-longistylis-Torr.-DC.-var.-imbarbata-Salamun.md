## Introduction

## Care Guide
This plant thrives in conditions similar to its native temperate deciduous forest understory. Provide it with partial to full shade and consistently moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Avoid harsh, direct sun and water stress, and fertilize lightly if needed.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Benefits from rich, organic soil; an annual application of compost or a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient.
