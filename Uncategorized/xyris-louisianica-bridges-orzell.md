| **🌍 Origin** | Southeastern United States (Gulf Coastal Plain), including Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Subtropical Wetland/Savanna (wet pine savannas) |
| **☀️ Light** | Full sun to partial sun; requires bright, direct light for robust growth, typical of open savanna environments. |

## 🌱 Overview
Xyris is a genus of flowering plants, the yelloweyed grasses, in the yellow-eyed-grass family.  The genus counts over 250 species, widespread over much of the world, with the center of distribution in the Guianas.
The leaves are mostly distichous, linear, flat, and thin or round with a conspicuous sheath at the base. They are arranged in a basal aggregation. The small, yellow flowers are borne on a spherical or cylindrical spike or head (inflorescence). Each flower grows from the axil of a leathery bract. The fruit is a nonfleshy, dehiscent capsule.  In Xyris complanata, a single flower bud on the spike appears in the morning, and expands into a conspicuous flower during the afternoon hours.
The APG IV system, of 2016, places the genus in family Xyridaceae, into the order Poales in the clade commelinids, in the monocots.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
This wetland plant thrives in consistently wet to boggy conditions and requires full sun for optimal health, mimicking its open savanna environment. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils, meaning fertilization should be minimal or avoided entirely to prevent harm.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Minimal to no fertilizer is required. This species is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils common in its native savannas, and excessive fertilization can be detrimental.
