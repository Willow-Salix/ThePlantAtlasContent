## Introduction
Ropalospora is a genus of lichen-forming fungi, and the sole member of the monogeneric family Ropalosporaceae. The genus was circumscribed by Italian lichenologist Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo in 1860. The family was proposed by Josef Hafellner in 1984.

## Care Guide
This lichen thrives in cool, highly humid environments with frequent atmospheric moisture and indirect light. It relies entirely on ambient humidity and rain for water and nutrients, making direct watering or fertilization unnecessary.

### Fertilizer
No direct fertilization required. Obtains necessary nutrients from atmospheric deposition (e.g., rain, dust, air particulates).
