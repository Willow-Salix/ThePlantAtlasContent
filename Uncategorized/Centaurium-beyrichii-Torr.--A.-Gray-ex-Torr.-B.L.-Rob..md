## Care Guide
Quinineweed thrives in full sun and well-draining, lean to moderately fertile soils, characteristic of its native prairie and limestone glade habitats. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between sessions, and exhibits good drought tolerance once established. Avoid heavy fertilization to maintain its natural vigor.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. This plant is adapted to lean to moderately fertile soils, such as those found in limestone glades and prairies. Avoid rich soils and heavy fertilization, which can be detrimental.
