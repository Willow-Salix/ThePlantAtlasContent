## 📋 Quick Specs

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Origin** | Tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas (Neotropics), including Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. |
| **🌡️ Climate** | Tropical Rainforest; often found in the humid understory of moist forests or montane cloud forests. |
| **☀️ Light** | Low to medium indirect light is ideal. As an understory plant, it is adapted to dappled light and should be protected from direct, harsh sunlight which can scorch its fronds. |
| **💧 Water** | Consistent moisture is crucial. Keep the soil evenly moist but never waterlogged, allowing the top inch to dry slightly between waterings. High humidity is also essential, so regular misting or placement near a humidifier is beneficial. |

## 🌱 Overview
Saccoloma is a fern genus in family Saccolomataceae. It is the only genus in the family in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), but further investigation is needed. It is pantropical and its species are found in wet, shaded forest areas. Saccoloma species are characterized by an omega-shaped (Ω) vascular bundle in the cross-sections of their petioles. The common name soralpouch fern is used for Saccoloma.

## 🧤 Care Instructions
The Soralpouch Fern thrives in conditions that mimic its native tropical rainforest understory, requiring consistent moisture and high humidity. Provide low to medium indirect light and a well-draining soil, fertilizing sparingly during its active growth period.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Light feeding with a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer (e.g., half strength) once a month during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or cease fertilization during cooler, darker months.
