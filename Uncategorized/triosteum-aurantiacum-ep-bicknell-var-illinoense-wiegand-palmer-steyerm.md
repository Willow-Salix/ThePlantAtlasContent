## 🧤 Care Instructions
To care for Illinois horse-gentian, provide partial shade and consistently moist, well-draining soil rich in organic matter. Ensure regular watering, especially when rainfall is scarce, and apply a moderate fertilizer in spring. This will mimic its preferred temperate woodland environment.

### 🧪 Fertilizer
Moderate fertility. Benefits from rich, organic soil. A balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer or compost amendment once in spring can be beneficial, but heavy feeding is not typically required.
