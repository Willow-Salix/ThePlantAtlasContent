## Introduction
Liatris (), commonly known as gayfeather and blazing star is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Eupatorieae within the family Asteraceae native to North America (Canada, United States, Mexico and the Bahamas).  Some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets. They are perennials, surviving the winter and resprouting from underground corms.
Liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as moths of the genus  Schinia.

## Care Guide
This North American prairie native thrives in full sun and well-draining, consistently moist soil during its growth period. It requires minimal fertilization and tolerates some drought once established. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overly wet conditions to prevent issues.

### Fertilizer
Low to moderate. Thrives in average to rich soil. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is usually sufficient, or none if planted in rich soil.
